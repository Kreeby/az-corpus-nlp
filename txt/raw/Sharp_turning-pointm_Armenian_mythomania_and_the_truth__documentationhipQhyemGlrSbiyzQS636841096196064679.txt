“He, who controls the present, controls the past.
He, who controls the past, holds the future.”
George Orwell,   “1984”
The mythomania is a mental disease characterized with pathological
addiction to mendacity. Taking into consideration the calumny and the nine-
ty years-old legend, which have been spread over for more than a century
now, about genocide supposedly perpetrated by the Turkish against the
Armenian people, it’s the very time to oppose that backbiting vigorously on
the ground of incontrovertible documents and visual materials.
There is a document where they endorse their being a belligerent nation.
“Mr. Minister,
I have the honour, in the
name of the Armenian National
Delegation, of submitting to
Your Excellency the following
declaration, at the same time
reminding you:
That the Armenians have
been, since the beginning of the
war, de facto belligerents, as
you yourself have acknowl-
edged, since they have fought
alongside the Allies on all
fronts, enduring heavy sacrifices
and great suffering for the sake
of their unshakeable attachment
to the cause of the Entente:
In France, through their vol-
unteers, who started joining the
Foreign Legion in the first days
and covered themselves with
glory under the French flag:
In Palestine and Syria, where
the Armenian volunteers, rec-
ruited by the National Delega-
tion at the request of the
government of the Republic,
formed the majority of the
French contingent and played
an important role in the victory
of General Allenby, as he him-
self and his French Chiefs have
officially declared; 
In the Caucasus, where, without including of 150.000 Armenians in the structure of the
Imperial Russian Army, more than 40.000 of their volunteers contributed to the libera-
tion of a portion of the Armenian vilayets, and where, under the command of their lead-
ers, Antranik and Nazarbekov, only they among the peoples of the Caucasus resisted to
the Turkish armies, from the beginning of the Bolshevist withdrawal right up to the sign-
ing of an armistice.”
His Excellency Mr. S. Pishon
The Minister of Foreign Affairs
Dear Minister, let me renew my assurances of highest respect to you,
Bogosh Nubar,
The Chairman.
Armenian fanatics have already been terrorizing the world for about a
century and a half. That started in the Ottoman Empire where Protestant
and Gregorian troublemakers and members of numerous Armenian political
organizations (Dashnaks, Hnchakists...) committed outrages and misled the
world community. For fear of the Armenian terror very few people dared to
tell the truth and this situation is still going on. Mark Sykes, who had writ-
ten the masterpiece “DAR UL ISLAM”, became the discoverer of Armenian
machinations at that time; so did “LE PETIT JOURNAL” magazine, which
also once dared to highlight the actual situation.
3
With the beginning of the war in 1914, affairs took a dramatic turn.
Armenians of the Ottoman Empire aspired purposefully to committing sabo-
tage at the Turkish rear. Strong alliances of the Armenian volunteers formed
in France, Russia and some other countries had set out against Turkey,
involved in the War of Five Fronts by that time; the “belligerent de facto
nation” had engaged in an insidious and cruel struggle against its own land,
where it had nothing but the benefits for about thousand years. The afore
cited document, the letter (1918) of Bogosh Nubar, then leader of
Armenians, to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Paris, is an incontrovertible
evidence of the true situation. They fought a war!
4
The attached photo (spring 1915)
displays the Armenian insurgents
armed with artillery, provided by the
Russians, opening the second front
behind the Ottoman lines to simplify
the seizure of Van by the Russians.
The “Underwood & Underwood” was the most significant press agency in
the USA in its time; its photographs used to spread all over the world being
considered absolutely reliable sources. The Armenian rebellion began in
February/March, 1915. Many photographs appearing in American and
British press portrayed the truth about the attack on Van behind the Ottoman
lines and demonstrations of alliances of Armenian volunteers under the
motto: “READY TO EXACT VENGEANCE: THE ARMENIAN CON-
TINGENT IN THE CAUCASUS”. The question is: “Vengeance for what?”
Is it really for that the Ottoman Armenians filled the most important state
positions, that they had the whole construction and financial business in their
hands, as well as economic import, or that they had religious freedom, mana-
ged the most expensive schools and enjoyed numerous privileges? 
5
The picture displays the detachment
of volunteers-hnchakists (“Young
Armenia”, July 20, 1915).
The monument in Sev`s not far from Van. 6000 of Muslim victims,
Turkish and Kurdish people, who were killed during the short period of vio-
lent reign of the Armenian par-militarists, rest in the earth-pit behind the
obelisk. One can hardly find a place in the whole of the Eastern Turkey with-
out a memorial to defenceless people murdered by Armenians in that tragic
spring of 1915.
6
“The Genocide Against Arme-
nians Before the Court. The Trial of
Talat Pasha” is a typical impudent
deception out of instigators’ work-
shop, deluding the reader: the pic-
ture of Talat Рasha, murdered by the
Armenian terrorist in Berlin, and a
heap of skulls depicted on the cover-
sheet automatically produce certain
impression about Armenian victims
of the events of 1915.
The deceit had undoubtedly
worked well, and that was a primary
goal. But in fact that picture is a
reproduction of “The Apotheosis of
War” (The Tretyakov Gallery,
Moscow) – a canvas by Vasily
Vereshaghin painted in 1871 (!!) in
memory of the war between Prussia
and France.
“The Forty Days of Musa Dagh”, a novel consisting of misrep-
resentations and distorted facts solely, has started its triumphal
tour around the world long ago and had formed the portrait of
“Vile Turks”. But it isn’t a fault of the great Austrian poet Franz
Werfel (the author of the novel): he is just a victim of the Armenian
band of swindlers and frauds, which had palmed off false docu-
ments upon him. 
The backstage leaders of this still working world-scale deception
were: Aram Andonian who crammed the whole book with ficti-
tious orders to kill, supposedly issued by the Young Turks; cunning
falsifier pastor Yohannes Lepsius whose machinations have been
only recently discovered; after that, there is also a book by
Morgenthau, the former US ambassador, who was surrounded
exclusively by Armenian trustworthy proxies and colleagues and
blindly trusted their speculations – we hope blindly, otherwise, he
would have been one of the main initiators of the Armenian terror.
Splendid as it is, though Werfеl’s novel has nothing to do with
the reality!
“A true and thrilling novel”? “Thrilling” – yes, but not “true”!
7
Today the “40 Days” is sold from the hawkers’ stand in the USA and English-
speaking space as sex&crime fiction and everywhere finds its reader who hardly
knows that the most important passages of the book, which clearly reflect Werfel’s
blunders, referring to the rebellion in Van for instance, are quietly obliterated, what
had also happened to the French edition. New editions of the book are being
manipulated. And mafia standing behind it perfectly knows why.
It is not so difficult to correct the mistakes on the cover of the book,
designed for external effect:
1. The Musa Dagh is not a volcanic formation: it is rather a harmless, slop-
ing mountainous landscape. Nobody lashed settlers neither at this place, nor
anywhere else in the Ottoman Empire. The Turkish legislation severely
punished such deeds. The story about sheets, supposedly used by rebels for
communication of SOS signal from the shore, is ridiculous as well (“Christians
in Disaster”). Armoured cruiser and transport ships of the French fleet units
had already cast off to deliver the precious freight to a safe place: because it
was the issue of thousands of potentially fanatic fighters for the Suez front!
2. The situation was the following further: the “heroes” of the Musa Dagh
undergone military training in the British and French camps in Cyprus and
Egypt, came to Syria to fight for a short period, but soon the Entente states
had withdrawn them as they grossly abused the power. The situation in the
Russian front was the same, where the tsar’s command began to move away
from them gradually. 
8
There are photographs of the camps
where the French and the British arranged
military training for the “victims” of the
Musa Dagh in order to engage them in the
front battles. These photographs have been
found in the Museum of History (Musee
d’Histoire Contemporaine) in Paris,
remaining out of sight of those Armenian
forces, which systematically “cleared”
“unpleasant” documents off the archives.
The attached is the photograph of the battleship “DESAIX”, the flagship
of the fleet cruising between Anatolia and Syria, the most vulnerable places
of the Ottoman Empire at that time. The mission of Armenians here was (as
in Van) to crack the rear of the Turkish front in order to facilitate the attack
of the Entente troops. 
And the ships were nowise called by means of sheets, but by the most up-
to-date radio equipment of that time.
9
After the end of the war the
Armenian falsifiers started distor-
tion of history anticipating George
Orwell’s “1984”, where “Ministry
of Truth” is described. A mani-
pulation by Aram Andonian, who
fabricated the “orders to kill”,
which had never existed, was typi-
cal for that period. But Sinasi Orel
and Surreyya Yuca have managed
to expose those falsifications in
their book “The Talat Pasha
Telegrams”.  “Fake” – “Falsified”!.
One of the letters forged by Aram Andоnian and dated February 18, 1331
(March 2, 1916) is cited here. The letter begins with the word “Bismillah”,
being written so that no Muslim would ever scribe it in such a way. But the
most fatal mistake made by Andonian was the date of the letter. Since he had
poor knowledge of rules of recalculation of a year by Rumi calendar of the
Ottomans and did not know about removal of disparity of 13 days between
Rumi and Christian calendars (February 1917), he dated the letter with
wrong year. He put 1331 instead of 1330 (1916), though the content of the
letter was built so to “prove” the resettlement as planned beforehand
action… but the source still had altered  date for full 9 (!) months. 
10
There  is  another  document
“№537”, dated “October 12, 1915”. In
his letter A.Andonian reports to Talat,
the Minister of Internal Affairs: “We
became aware that some people,
including officials, marry Armenian
girls. We strictly forbid it and insis-
tently recommend identification and
exiling such people into the desert”.
And what about the true number of victims? There is an irrefutable docu-
ment drawn up by Bogosh Nubar, the leader of the Armenian representation
on refugee affairs in Paris then:
In this document is definitely pointed out that the number of victims
among Armenian settlers was 300.000, while losses of Muslims during the
period of the Civil War were estimated at 500.000 victims (Kurds, Turks and
Charkaz`), simply forgotten, nobody speak or write about them just because
they are only “useless Turks”, as one Armenian bishop had once said.
11
“Dear Minister,
Since you have expressed
your desire, I’m honoured to
present you an approximate
number of the Armenian set-
tlers and refugees from Turkey
standing in need for urgent aid.
From them, approximately:
250.000 are in the Caucasus
40.000 – in Persia
80.000 – in Syria and Palestine
20.000 – in Mosul and Baghdad
Total: 390.000
The total number of the
deported is estimated at 600-
700.000 persons. The figures
which I have written to you
reflect the number of survivors
currently residing at the new
territories occupied by the
Alliance troops. The rest of the
deportees are scattered on deserted lands, so we have no detailed information
about them.
Dear Minister, accept the assurances of my highest consideration and best
wishes.
Mr. Gouv
Minister Plenipotentiary
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs”
The letter was sent by Bogosh Nubar, the Representative of Armenians in
France, to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. (Archives of the Ministry of Foreign
Affairs of France, Middle East section, “Armenia”, vol. 2, p. 47)
Facts
Justin McCarthy, one of the best demographers in the world, professor of the
Louisville University (USA), has issued an undeniable edition “Muslims and
Minorities – The Population of Ottoman Anatolia and the End of the Empire” and
then described the results of his research in a table. The question of WHERE and
HOW Armenian fanatics and their Protestant instigators from the USA wanted
to establish a Protestant Armenian State immediately falls off itself.

Table Two. Armenian Population of the Ottoman Empire, 1912
The Greeks and Armenians constituted the Christian population of the
Ottoman Empire mainly and that fact was certified on the map with graph-
ic data (J. McCarthy reproduced it from “Armenians in the Late Ottoman
Period” by Tukay Ataov (Ankara, 2001)).
The map of Anatolia with being often met toponym “Six Vilayets” on it –
six Ottoman administrative units (provinces) in the east of the Empire,
unambiguously confirm that the idea of establishing a “Protestant”
Armenian state was purely illusive, unless the expulsion of all the Muslims
had been planned beforehand. The same policy has been pursued on a dra-
matic scale during the deportation of the Azerbaijanis out of their own lands
in the west of the country nowadays.
The definition of “Six Vilayets”, as if mainly inhabited by Armenians, is
one of the standard expressions invented by circles interested in disturbances,
terror and war. Here J. McCarthy also reveals true circumstances. There is a
deep delusion concerning the words “Armenia” and “Armenians”: Armenia
is a great geographical definition just like America; the Brazilians, Maya,
Eskimos are the same Americans as the USA citizens. The same applies to
Armenia where including “Haik”s (as Armenians call themselves, and
“Hayastan” is their republic situated in the east of Anatolia), Turkish,
Kurdish, Georgians and other small ethnic groups reside.
Here is a classical example of manipulations concerning the population of
"Six Vilayets": Armenian delegates reporting to the Entente Powers in Paris
after the World War One presented the "Armenian patriarchy`s statistics",
where 1,018,000 of Haiks and 165,000 of other Christians opposed to
1,432,000 - the aggregate number of Muslims, whereas 666,000 were Turkish,
the remaining part consisted of Charkaz, Laz, Kurdish nomads, Kurdish set-
tlers and others. That turns all the "documentation" into sheer fraud as the
census in the Ottoman Empire has never been based upon nationalities, but
confessional principle, as it was mentioned above.
13
According to the Ottoman statistics Armenians constituted 784,917 (19%),
other Christians – 176,845 (4%) and Muslims – 3,173,918 (77%).

Demolition of the Azerbaijani
town of Khojaly had accompa-
nied not only with expulsion of
population, but the massacre of
innocent people became world-
wide known event deserving uni-
versal contempt and comparable
for its brutality with the events of
Hitler or Stalin era.
One century later Azerbaijan still commemorates thousands of victims of
Armenian attacks of 1905, when Armenians backboned by tsarist Russia
made first overt attempt to seize power in Baku and thus, to appropriate
Azerbaijani oil. Those days’ photos witnessed the scales of the Armenian
aggression, which finally frightened Russians and they stopped this mas-
sacre.
Another photo depicts transportation of provision for occupants. An end-
less row of the Armenian trucks stretches on the territory of Azerbaijan
delivering arms and ammunition for occupation forces and new settlers
exceeding in number on the illegally occupied territories.
17
These are typical pictures of
the territories occupied by
Armenians shot from satellite.
The town of Gubadly situated
close to Nakhichevan in the south
of Azerbaijan is seen on the satel-
lite photo. Massive military
installations, tanks and military
aerodrome are clearly seen. The
members of the OSCE delega-
tion, visited Karabakh and other
occupied territories in March
2005, witnessed the awful picture
of Azerbaijani villages, farm-
steads and settlements completely
devastated by Armenians. This is
a question of attempt to wipe off
everything of the Azerbaijani ori-
gin and to cover, both in literal
and figurative meaning of the
word, traces of the aggressive
war.
There is also historical photo from Shusha, where Armenians raged in
1905. That was the first culmination flash of aggression. 
18
The events of 1905 were just a prelude of the attempt to seize Azerbaijan
entirely. Photos taken after destructions committed by Armenians in Baku
13 years later speak for themselves. 
Everything repeated all over again in March 1918 on a "higher" level:
the Armenian troops invaded Baku and stayed here as a new masters of
the city. 20000 of Azerbaijanis were killed and local population was
purged away in the course of Armenian attacks.
There is a dramatic report about the events of 1918 in Azerbaijan prepared
by count Trauttmansdorff, the member of the Austrian-Hungarian govern-
ment in the Ottoman Empire (in the foreign vocabulary of that time
Azerbaijanis used to be called “Tatars”: the artificial definition introduced to
diminish the nation, as Tatars considered to be low-graded nation in spite of
their rich and distinctive culture and ability to repulse Russians for many
centuries).
19
The document extracted from Vienna State Archive runs:
20
“In March 21 the Bolsheviks
sent an ultimatum to Tatars
demanding to give up all arms
till 5 o’clock in the afternoon
and recognize the Soviet
Government. Armenians behav-
ed neutrally. They sent their
representative to Tatars, who
clearly stated the unwillingness
of Armenians to consider with
the Bolsheviks.
In spite of this in the evening
of March 31 Armenians had
joined the Bolsheviks and
attacked Tatars. The attack
started suddenly. Tatars had 5
machine-guns and no artillery
at all: the Bolsheviks and
Armenians had 12 ordnances,
not counting naval artillery.
Regular Tatar forces counted
400-500 men, whereas Armeni-
ans had a regiment since
January, and the Bolsheviks
had one and a half regiment at
their disposal. Imperfect organi-
zation and Turkish officers’
commanding predetermined their failure.
There also were rumours that Tatars didn’t want to make donations for the for-
mation of military units.
The slaughter started in March 31 and stopped in April 3. There were approxi-
mately 12000 dead. The houses have been partly burnt down and destroyed.
The “Izmail” building, an architectural masterpiece, was completely destroyed.
Those who did not manage to escape were killed by Armenians in their own houses.
Armenians disembowelled female Muslims. There was no mercy even to children.
Some estrangement between the Bolsheviks (Russians) and Armenians became con-
sequence of all these infamous crimes.
I had a little chance to talk to the Tatar intelligentsia, as many of them escaped.
Partially to Tiflis.
At present Baku is almost completely cut off from the outer world.”
Armenian aggression is the ideological essence of the state. One glance at the
state emblem of this strange republic is quite enough to understand that, because
it confirms that this country finds the meaning of own existence in war, terror,
deceit and conquests.
The Ararat mountain, although its name has nothing in common with Armenia
neither in linguistic, nor in historical sense, is considered to be the place where Noah’s
Ark had put in to. It is wrong time and place to speculate about veracity or absurdi-
ty of this statement, but things take an aggressive-political turn when Armenians
claim their being descends of forefather Noah; but in case if this idea is confirmed,
then the given privilege would be applicable not only to haiks, but to everyone.
Besides that, the Ararat is in the territory of Turkey. How would the German
react to engraving of Brandenburg Gates on the Polish state emblem? The
French to decorating of Bundestag Plenary Hall with Eiffel Tower, or Tower
Bridge with the French three-coloured flag? It is inconceivable, isn’t it? There is
no longer hammer and sickle today. The Ararat and Ark substitute them well.
21
1918 – 1920 1922 – 1937 since 19.04.1992
QUESTION ON CONSCIENCE:
HOW COULD SOME POLITICIANS SPEAK CERTAINLY ABOUT
EVENTS OF 1915, HAVING NOT A SLIGHTEST IDEA ON THE SUB-
JECT, INSTEAD OF MASSACRE OF HUNDRED THOUSANDS
AND EXILE OF THREE MILLIONS OF SUDET GERMANS AFTER
WAR IN 1946?
The answer is simple. Certain circles want to block admission of Turkey into
the European Union at any price and resort to any means to achieve that goal,
although simultaneously they simply ignore the Decrees of Benesh still in force, as
if nothing had happened.
And that is not the issue here whether Turkey wants or has to join the
European Union... this is completely different story. The duplicity is the point
here, including the duplicity of Christian “representatives of the people” who
want to blame Ankara by deceiving about events of 1915 and knowing nothing
about real situation; but they refuse to utter a word about the Armenian aggression
against Azerbaijan which is still in progress! Tens of thousands of killed and one
million of refugees! Today. Now!
And what about Turkey? Despite of complete encirclement and mass threats
from Germany Turkey accepted tens of thousands of refugees during World
War Two, including Ernest Reuter and no one was deported. Gratitude: slander.
22
Vienna, June 20, 1984: worthy of love, family and job-devoted diplomat
responsible for wellbeing of arriving Turkish workers, who was born decades
after the tragic events of 1915, was killed by Armenian terrorists in front of
the Turkish embassy. Erdogan Ozen (b.1950!) was my friend. Since then I'm
striving for the truth in history to achieve establishment of peace.
THE STATEMENT OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: office of the
Press Secretary, April 24, 2005:
“We are committed to search for a peaceful and lasting resolution of the Karabakh conflict. I
highly appreciate all those people working in the name of peace, tolerance and reconciliation…”
The hope of Armenian mafia in the USA to put pressure upon the President and make him
accept the word “genocide” failed. Whereas quite the contrary happened. Sharp turn ensued.
A sharp turning-point! The
resistance of Turks and
Azerbaijanis to the Armenian
false propaganda and
aggression is being formed. 
Vienna, April 02, 2005 – a demonstration in front of the embassy of the Republic of Hayastan
