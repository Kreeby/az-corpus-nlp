This research proved that,huge territory,discovered by Christopher Columbus,was named wrongly.Because,Amerigo Vespucci deceived people around him,especially scientists.He used letters,written by Columbus,Diego Chanca and Pero Vaz de Caminha in the New World,when wrote his well-known letters,it turned out that,two of his four travels were false,he approached Colum-bus,learned his secrets and disgraced the admiral owing to those secrets,offered to name the forth continent “America” when he was head navigator of Castile,passed maps,which were considered state secret,to the cartographers.It isn’t just to name the continent in honor of such swindler.D 4702060103 R.Daniz,2015 M 087-2015   3 I want to thank management of SOCAR for material and spiritual support in publication of this book The book has been published with the order of “Partnyor” Public Union on Support of Science Development with the grant of SOCAR   4 Preface-Elucidation of enigmas concerning the travel of Amerigo Vespucci Though many researches have been carried out in the field of the history of geographical discoveries,this field of the science looks as endless as oceans.Every research work written in the age of major geographical discoveries includes some innovation.Ramiz Daniz (Gasimov),who has carried out important works in this field,wrote his forth book in the series of the history of geographical discoveries and presented to the readers,especially geographers,cartographers,historians and other scien-tists.He has described real discovery of America in his work “Christopher Columbus,Nasiraddin Tusi and real discovery of America” and proved that,the celebrated Spanish sea traveler knew where,through which current and parallel and how long he had to sail beforehand during his first travel.Besides,he knew the distance between the territories,located on the other coast of the Atlantic Ocean,and western coasts of Europe.Ramiz Daniz has explained the reason,why Christopher Columbus kept it secret,in detail.Besides,  5 the author tried to draw world’s attention to the most important reality – Columbus could discover America owing to the astronomic catalogue “Zij-i Ilkhani” pre-pared by the celebrated Azerbaijani scientist Nasiraddin Tusi (1201-1274),who lived in the 13th century and his calculations given in the table of geographical coor-dinates.The author’s second scientific work is “The scientist passed ahead of centuries – Nasiraddin Tusi”.The work is about the works,presented by the Azerbaijani scientist Muhammad Nasiraddin Tusi to the world,cons-truction of Maraga observatory and usage of equipment of the observatory in other observatories,misappro-priation of some of the scientist’s works by other scientists,analysis of the map of Turkish admiral Piri Reis,propagandization of several geographical disco-veries,development of geography in the Ancient,Early and Middle Ages,and many other secrets about disco-very of America.Here are opinions of the academician Ramiz Mammadov about that book:“The author investi-gated scientific works and achievements of the celebrated scientist Nasiraddin Tusi,could explain essence of most works and found out that several works of the scientist were misappropriated by other scientists.  6 It is known that,Tusi have masterpieces on the astronomy,mathematics,geometry and ethics and he had a significant role in development of these sciences passing ahead of celebrated scientists in these fields for hundreds of years.The author mentioned scientific works of scientists of the ancient times,who lived in Rome,Byzantine,Egypt and Muslim scientists,lived in the Early Middle Ages,on geography,astronomy and mathematics and tried to describe Tusi’s success in these fields”.There are a lot of new facts and serious thoughts on the discovery of Brazil in the book “Enigmatic disco-very of Brazil”.The author has noted that,mentioned territory was discovered by Duarte Pacheco Pereira in the first quarter of 1494,but not by Pedro Álvares Cabral in 1500.Results of Pereira’s travel were presented to the Portuguese when the Treaty of Tordesillas (1494)was signed and they deceived representatives of Spain by means of the Pope Alexander Borgia VI and moved demarcation line for 370 liq towards the west of the Green Cape Islands.The author approaches major geographical discoveries from new prism and elucidates most obscurities in this field by discovering interesting details.Such productivity   7 is a proof of his high energy and rich intellectual potential.The author analyzed major geographical discoveries differently and tried to find out new details about most unknown issues.It proves that he has great passion and his intellectual potential is rich enough.Above mentio-ned works were presented in the Institute of Geography of ANAS,named after Hasan Aliyev,on March 5,2014 under my chairmanship,and some interesting and valuable opinions were said about the author’s resear-ches.Particularly,I want to note that,the public writer Chingiz Abdullayev supports R.Daniz’s literary works and celebrated detective author’s participation and mentionable speeches proved it once again.It should be mentioned that,works of Ramiz Daniz,who is known as an innovator owing to his historical adventure books “Conquistadors,travelling to the coasts of the New World”,“Tragic death of conquis-tadors on the coasts of the Central Chile”,“Holy mission”,“People going to the Paradise appear in the Hell” (events occur in the 16th century in Spain,Brazil,Argentina,Peru,Ecuador and Chile),and sensational scientific works on the history of geographical disco-veries made in the Early and Middle Ages,are supported   8 by Azerbaijan Geographic Society,Aqra Public Union on Support of Science Development,Union of Great Patriotic War Veterans and SOCAR,who has a signify-cant role in translation and publication of these works,besides Chingiz Abdullayev.Hundreds,even thousands of books have been written about Amerigo Vespucci and his activity during that period,so,we can think that,any obscures wasn’t left about the Florentine cosmographer.It has been accepted as the fact that,Amerigo Vespucci,who conquered the Atlantic Ocean with the flags of Spain and Portugal,sailed towards the coasts of the New World four times,discovered outfall of the Amazon River – the richest river of the world and reached coasts of Antarctica (520 latitude)first of all Europeans.He declared that the New World was the forth continent of the world and Martin Waldsemuller named that territory “America” in honor of Vespucci.That’s why,scientists of the world considers him one of the most celebrated sea travelers as Christo-pher Columbus,Vasco da Gama,Bartolommeo Dias and Ferdinand Magellan.A.Humboldt,F.Varnhagen,R.Pombu,A.Slozkin,I.Magidovich,V.Magidovich and other scientists carried out enough researches about Vespucci and presented   9 most of his books to the world community.Almost the most important information and facts have been found out with all details.R.Daniz’s scientific work disproves all facts known about Vespucci.It analyses activity of the Florentine cosmographer and disproves many historical facts known about him with objective arguments.The author has proved following facts in his book “Amerigo Vespucci,Martin Waldsemuller – secret bargain”:Vespucci travelled to America twice as a merchant,but not quadrice and 32-page letter,which brought him fame,is a copy of some lines of diaries of Pero Vaz de Caminha,Diego Chanca and Christopher Columbus.According to the author,lines of America on the map made by Martin Waldsemuller in 1507 were analogous to the lines on the left corner of the map made by Piri Reis in 1513 and same source was used for these maps.Result of the research carried out by the author:1.Vespucci hadn’t any role in discovery of the Amazon River.The Florentine cosmographer tried to present his fictitious letter to the world community in order to appropriate another sea traveler’s success.  10 2.R.Deniz proves that,Vespucci didn’t sail to 520 latitude near Antarctica.3.The Florentine cosmographer didn’t travel quadrice as scientists wrote,he travelled only twice as the member of the Chamber of Commerce.4.The author has found out that,Vespucci’s corres-pondence with the king of Portugal Manuel I wasn’t real.5.The map made by Waldsemuller in 1507 was handed over by Vespucci.6.Secret proposals of Vespucci as the navigation officer of Castile had a significant role in naming the forth continent America in books and maps prepared by most geographers and cartographer.It means that,he used his powers in order to name the continent,disco-vered by Columbus,“America”.7.In general,the author declared that,it is unjust to name the New World “America” and scientists all over the world have to make serious steps to correct this mistake.Ramiz Daniz’s new work allows to look through Amerigo Vespucci’s biography,his personal and public activity and his tracks in the history.So,novelties of this book will attract attention of scientists working in the field of the history of geography.I’m sure that,scientists’   11 reactions will not be univocal and new works will appear for coming to the common conclusion.As mentioned works are about some periods of the history of Portugal,Spain,Italy,Brazil,Azerbaijan and Turkey,they can cause interest in these countries.The deputy director of scientific work of the Institute of Geography of ANAS,named after Hasan Aliyev,corresponding member of ANAS,Professor Elbrus Alizadeh   12 Amerigo Vespucci,Martin Waldsemuller – secret bargain The name America was a result of betrayal against Christopher Columbus.As the forth continent,become subject to juridical debates between the family of Columbus and Spanish monarchs,that territory has been named after an ordinary bank employer for five centuries.The author   13 Amerigo Vespucci’s travels to the Mediterranean countries People tried to discover unknown lands using primi-tive methods in order to appropriate new territories since ancient times and continued this work for centuries.Astronomers,geographers,cartographers,cosmogra-phers,travelers,researchers and historians did their best for learning the Earth and carried out many researches.Though only three continents were known,their territories’ positions were unknown for scientists.But in spite of it,there were scientists,who tried to draw lines of the Earth on the map even BC and it proves that geography is one of the ancient sciences.Travelers,researchers and scientists discover unknown lands and historians write such facts down.Cartographers drew lines of discovered lands in order to present information about discoveries to the society and founded cartography by the way.It isn’t difficult to imagine how difficult it was then.Astronomers discovered stars and drew them on the astronomical maps,geographers made maps of discovered lands and travelers went to investigate unknown lands.Travelers and researchers   14 drew discovered unknown lands on the maps they made primitively.It was very difficult to research regions of Europe and Asia in the Middle Ages.Because,territories,which were interesting for merchants and travelers,were occupied by neighbor countries.The role of ambassadors and merchants was greater than travelers’ in investigation of countries,located in the central part of Asia.They brought initial interesting information about unknown countries to the European countries.Every traveler had enough necessary information about Asian countries before travelling to those countries at the end of XV century.Travels of members of Franciscan Order – Giovanni da Pian del Carpine and Benedict of Poland (from Vrotslav)in 1245-1247,member of Dominican Order,monarch Andrew Lanjumon in 1249,member of Franciscan Order Gilliom (Villain)Rubric in 1252-1255,merchants Niccolo and Maffeo Polo from Venice in 1260-1269,Marco Polo in 1271-1295 and Abu Abdullah Muhammad in 1325-1349 towards Eastern Asia,books written about those travels and gathered materials were spread in European countries and were valuable source for people interested in travels.  15 Art,culture,science and engineering were more developed in the cities,located in the Apennine Penin-sula,in comparison with other regions.Even there was serious competition between those cities.There were artists in Florence,ship masters and navigators in Genoa and Venice.Scientists and travelers,who lived in those cities,were interested in geography and astronomy and they learned these fields profoundly.Celebrated traveler Marco Polo from Venice,well-known astronomer and geographer Paolo Toscanelli from Florentine,travelers Christopher Columbus and Sebastian Cabot from Genoa had been brought up till the end of XV century.The Florentine traveler Giovanni da Verrazzano was able to go down in the history in the first quarter of the 16th century owing to his discoveries.Though Florence isn’t a port city,it could bring up successful astronomer and cosmographer as Amerigo Vespucci.How could well-known sea travelers as Christopher Columbus,Giovanni Cabot,Sebastian Cabot,Amerigo Vespucci and Giovanni da Verrazzano,be brought up in the cities,located in the Apennine Peninsula during such short time? It should be acknowledged that,these Italians   16 had a significant role in major geographical discoveries and discovery of the New World.But mentioned sea travelers didn’t sail with flags of Venice and Genua.Though they were Italians,worked out of the Apennine Peninsula – Christopher Columbus in Spain,Giovanni Cabot and Sebastian Cabot in England,Amerigo Vespucci in Spain and Portugal,Giovanni da Verrazzano in France.Strange paradox occurs:Was naval school so weak on the eastern coast of the Atlantic Ocean? Why they couldn’t send expeditions under indigenous people’s leadership? It isn’t a reason.Graduates of Catalonia and Andalusia in Spain,Sagres in Portugal,sea travelers of Brittany and Marseille in France,Bristol and London in England,had great navigation system and they investigated almost all eastern and northern coasts of the Atlantic Ocean.But mentioned Italian sea travelers could be enough courageous to sail towards territories,located on the other side of the Atlantic Ocean.They were like the Phoenician.It means that,it has another reason.I came to the following conclusion at the result of my researches:They had secret documents and maps proving existence   17 of the forth continent.That’s why,they could gain major successes in the history of geographical discoveries.The rich materials gathered at the result of the geographical discoveries,ended lasting stagnation in the field of geography and explained obscurities and wrong ideas.1 Activities of mentioned sea travelers had a great role in introduction of North and South America to the Old World.Which factor influenced improvement of those people? There were well-known sea travelers in Portugal,who could overcome transatlantic expeditions.The difference between Pyreness and Apennine Peninsulas:Italian sea travelers regularly traveled to the countries,located in the east of the Mediterranean Sea,including Iran,Central Asia and Chine,but Portuguese sea travelers investigated western coasts of Africa.The Spanish,who were busy with Reconquista (freeing Spain from Arabians),travelled only to Canaries.The Genoese and Venetians,who competed with each others for hegemony on the Mediterranean Sea,gave 1 T.Hәsәnov,Ә.Hacızadә.Coğrafiya tarixi,Bakı Univesitetinin Nәşriyyatı.Milli Virtual Kitabxana.Bakı,2001 sәh.25   18 special importance to cartography,got different maps from Arabian and Turkish seamen and worked a lot to improve them.Science and education centers had been founded in Florence,Bologna,Padua and Pizza and their leading scientists began to investigate scientific works of Muslim scientists in the Near East.As the astronomy,mathe-matics,geography and cartography were developed speedily in the East,these scientists’ works were interesting for scientists of the West.Scientists of the East learned about existence of the forth continent first,gave initial information about it and could attract attention of the scientists of the West.The West was interested in India,which was full of gold,jewel and spices and neighboring regions.Land routes to this country,which was considered world of tales,were under control of Turks and Muslims.So,Christians,who didn’t want to pay taxes to Muslims,had to think about alternative routes.That’s why,they discovered the forth continent,which was unknown for a long time,in 1492 as tried to discover lands around the Atlantic Ocean.Discovery of the western route to India consists of five stages.The first stage covers 1415-1434,second 1434-  19 1362,third 1470-1475 and the forth covers 1482-1487.The fifth stage began in 1497.Paolo dal Pozzo Toscanelli (1397-1484)was well-known enough in the second half of the 15th century and his fame had got over the borders of the Apennine Peninsula.It isn’t strange that,captains and navigators asked him for advice when were going to travel.Columbus also worked with P.Toscanelli,before he became conqueror of seas and ocean.Same things may be said about Vespucci too.Perhaps,he was interested in astronomy and geography owing to the Florentine scientist.Both of them were known as cosmographers in the world.Vespucci,who was enough professional in his job,had promised to realize the most sensational discovery in order to be remembered together with Marco Polo and Cadamosto.It is known that,the Florentine accountant could keep his promise.How is it possible? How can a man,who hadn’t any significant role in major geographical discoveries,be remembered together with the most celebrated sea travelers? How could Amerigo Vespucci gain this fame? He had to have enough information in order to make the world to believe him.Why did leading scientists didn’t   20 analyze his claims? Who was responsible for this confusion? Amerigo Vespucci or scientists,who allowed his lie to be spread? Paolo dal Pozzo Toscanelli (1397-1482)  21 Scientists of Europe only watched events happening around.But the lie continued broaden its activity.It could be possible by making some planned steps.Scientists weren’t so credulous then.Some background was needed for it.He had to make the world to believe that,the New World was discovered by Vespucci,not by Columbus.He became more popular than Christopher Columbus,Bartolomeu Dias,Vasco da Gama,Vicente Yáñez Pinzón,Alonso de Ojeda,Juan de la Cosa,Pedro Alonso (Peralonso)Nino and other sea travelers,who had a significant role in major geographical discoveries.He achieved it owing his made-up letters,published by different publishers.Researches proved that,letters spread in Europe by Vespucci,didn’t contain his real memories,they were copies of information given by other travelers.He simply gathered and spread mentioned information.There isn’t any confusion and investigations proved that,the letters spread in Europe under Vespucci’s name,didn’t include facts seen by him during the travels,but they were forged letters prepared using materials of other travelers.He simply gathered all facts and presented to the society by means of some emissaries.  22 I had to look through events,happened 520 years ago,and describe corresponding processes in order to find out the truth.So,justice could win at last.There were different discussions about birth date of Vespucci.So,birth date of the well-known Florentine astronomer is known as 1451 or 1454.But according most sources,Vespucci was born on March 9,1454 in Florentine in the family of notary.According to the metric handbook,little Amerigo Mateo Vespucci was baptized in Florentine on March 18,1454.He was named Amerigo as his grandfather’s name was Amerigo.Mateo was his second name,as they thought that,every Christian had a guardian angel.But nobody called him with this name.His father Anastasio Vespucci was a public notary.As Amerigo didn’t go to school,he was taught by his uncle Giorgio Antonio Vespucci,who was known as the monk and educated man.Amerigo Vespucci’s elder brother Antonio was scientist of the University of Pizza and his middle brother Geronimo worked in Syria as a merchant.Another uncle,who was a diplomat and lawyer,took him to France when he went to Paris within the special mission.It was Amerigo’s first travel before 1490.  23 Vespucci tried to learn physics,nautical astronomy and geography very well in his youth.He worked as a manager of the bank and was a “reliable person” for Lorenzo de Medici,who would be a ruler of Florence,in 1480s.Vespucci often went to Spain in order to fulfil tasks of his boss as there were representatives of Medici’s company in cities of Spain.He was in Seville in 1490.Vespucci bought navigation map of the Mediterra-nean Sea,made by the cartographers of Catalonia in Pizza in 1437.It proves that,he was interested in navigation even then.Amerigo has been lucky since he was very young.He worked at the company of Medici,which was popular in most countries of Europe besides the Apennine Penin-sula.Of course,it impacted his life positively.Vespucci could approach most influential persons of Florence owing to Medici.He went to Seville in 1492 according to Medici’s commission and served with his fellow-countryman Capetto (Juanoto or Cuanoto)Berardi.He was acquain-ted with Columbus when he worked for Berardi.There were several chambers of commerce in Spain as the trade network of Italians was large there.One of their representatives was Cuanoto Berardi,who financed the   24 second expedition of Columbus (1493-1496).He was lucky for this acquaintanceship.Vespucci could gain that influential person’s trust when he was in Seville.Amerigo Mateo Vespucci (1454-1512)  25 Did it happen by accident? One of those persons was a representative of Italians,who worked in Spain,C.Berardi and another was Columbus,who could make politically and geographically important discovery.The most important event of Vespucci’s life happened in 1495.Berardi died in that year and the Florentine accountant undertook to do all his works.It is necessary to consider this part of Vespucci’s life.According to some historians,the Florentine accountant could be acquainted with Columbus and gain his trust owing to his acquaintance with C.Berardi.Medici,who looked for new markets,financed some expeditions toward the coasts of the New World.That’s why,correct information was needed about new terri-tories,discovered on the other side of the ocean.Medicis had to send their representatives to those lands.One of those plenipotentiary representatives was Vespucci,who had prepared for this mission seriously.It was a serious problem for experts to determine Vespucci’s position during organized expeditions.He worked as captain,navigator,cosmographer,cartogram-pher,chronicler,representative of the trade center and merchant.  26 It is necessary to take Vespucci’s mentioned relations in serious in order to elucidate these issues.His uncle,who was a diplomat and lawyer,took him to France when he went to Paris with mission.It was Amerigo’s first travel before 1490.Vespucci’s enigmatic life For about two hundred years,all historians had been thinking that,Vespucci told lies deliberately.He stole fame of Columbus declaring discovery,made by the well-known Spanish traveler,as his own achievement.Researches proved that,really,Vespucci tried to misappropriate achievements of Columbus.Many well-known scientists tried to support him.It seems to me that,those scientists did it as they didn’t learn the Florentine accountant’s activity in detail.As Vespucci hadn’t any role in discovery of any part of the New World,even he didn’t participate in   27 preparation of the letters,spread in most countries of Europe,it isn’t just to introduce him as well-known sea traveler of his time.I think that,originality of those letters is doubtful.I’ll give detailed information about it afterwards.The researcher,geographer and traveler Alexander von Humboldt (1769-1859)was one of the scientists,who investigated Vespucci’s activity in the 19th century.He could get interesting and even strange results.The Ger-man scientist supported Vespucci in his works “Critical research of the history of the new continent” and “Cosmos”.Alexander von Humboldt proved following facts at the result of his researches:1.There wasn’t any claim against the Florentine cosmographer before 30th years of the 16th century,even by heirs and friends of Columbus.2.Nobody can blame Amerigo Vespucci for misrepre-sentation of facts and mistakes in his letters:He didn’t publish any material and couldn’t control materials,published abroad.3.Rights of heirs of Christopher Columbus on coasts of the New World could be proved according to their claims against Spanish authority.Witnesses were needed for Spanish authority in all ports of Spain then.Officials   28 didn’t think about asking for Amerigo Vespucci’s help,but named the new continent,discovered in 1497,“America” in honor of the Florentine cosmographer taking his participation at the expedition to the coasts of the New World into account.1 Though Alexander von Humboldt was professional researcher,his results prove that,he didn’t investigate the Florentine accountant’s life in detail.Otherwise,he didn’t support an adventurer.I have to say my versions against the German geographer’s thoughts:1.Who had to claim against Vespucci in those years? Nobody was aware of his fraud except the elite,who was close to the Spanish monarchs.His “letters” were spread out of Spain and caused great interest in people,who were interested in new discoveries.He knew whom to send letters in order to achieve desired effect.2.Vespucci was responsible for all misrepresentations of facts and mistakes in letters.Because the sea traveler,who had investigated northern and southern coasts of the southern continent,hadn’t to make such mistakes.1 АvаDəеvа Е.Н.,ЗDаnоviç Л.İ.Сtо vеliкiх mоrе-plаvаtеlеy.Москvа,«Веçе»,1999 г.сtr.78.  29 Mistakes prove that,he didn’t sail to those coasts or hadn’t correct information as wasn’t an important person of the expedition.Alexander von Humboldt (1769-1859)  30 3.The German scientist notes that,the authority could use Vespucci when the debate started between the Spanish authority and heirs of Columbus.According to Humboldt,if Vespucci claimed that,he had discovered the new continent and his letters “full of mistakes” were taken into account,the Spanish authority couldn’t miss the witness as him.It means that,the letters prepared by the Florentine accountant could destroy everything and his legendary travel of 1497 could be exposed.Because that travel wasn’t real and those letters weren’t written on the basis of real events.I can’t understand Humboldt’s regard for Vespucci.Besides Humboldt,there are many historians and resear-chers,who supported him.The Brazilian historian Friedrich Adolf Varnhagen defended the Florentine accountant with great enthu-siasm.Though Vespucci’s exposure continued spreading,he tried to prove his opinions.Though Humboldt wanted to prove that,Vespucci was a swindler,Friedrich Varn-hagen devoted most of his life for proving that,Vespucci sailed to the coasts of the new continent in 1497-1498 and discovered whole coastline of the Gulf of Mexico till   31 the Florida.Such absurd idea shouldn’t be said by the researcher.It seems that,Varnhagen didn’t know anything about most activities of the Florentine accountant and results of expeditions,trying to find new territories around the Caribbean Sea.There were few sea travelers,who couldn’t reach Florida and coasts near it till 1503.But they investigated northern coasts of today’s South America though Columbus didn’t know about it.Varnhagen and his students tried to convince every-body of the truth of their theories by misrepresenting facts at the result of their investigations.They wrote that,head navigator of Castile firstly reached the continent,located in the west,and sailed to the other side of the Atlantic Ocean for three times after he returned to Europe till 1504.But discovery of 3000 km coastline in the west of the Atlantic Ocean by the great expedition had to cause great resonance in Spain and Portugal.Population of these countries could get information about important geogra-phical discoveries,made on the other side of the Atlantic Ocean,by means of their relatives or friends.But coordinates of discovered points were coded.Discovery of Vespucci couldn’t be missed by everybody.  32 Friedrich Adolf Varnhagen (1645-1701)The expedition of 1497-1498,mentioned in Vespuc-ci’s biography,didn’t take place in reality.Alexander Humboldt,who had traveled to America several times,said about naming the continent “Ame-rica”:“It was done by common consent.This name   33 appeared by accident… Vespucci gained fame by acci-dent,but this fame began to cast a shadow on his memory afterwards.Such disreputable event happens rarely.It is an example of the shame rising together with fame”.1 I am not agree with these unserious thoughts.Vespucci falsified the discovery and deceived European community.First,he was acquainted with Christopher Columbus,Alonso de Ojeda,Juan de la Cosa and other well-known travelers in order to learn secrets about the new continent.Second,letters,written by Vespucci on the coasts of the New World,were published out of the Pyreness Peninsula during a very short time.The Florentine accountant new that,those stories,which were full of fictions and extraordinary events,would have great repercussions in countries of Europe,which didn’t know anything about the New World,and he would be known as celebrated sea traveler in France,Netherlands,Germany,Denmark and England.The progressive people of these countries,including scientists,needed informa-1 İ.П.МагiDоviç,В.İ.МагiDоviç.Оçеrкi pо iсtоrii геогrафiçескiх оtкrıtiy,II tоm.Москvа,“Пrосvеhеniе”,1982.сtr.81   34 tion about lands discovered on the other side of the ocean.There is no doubt that,stories of the Florentine accountant wouldn’t be taken seriously in the Pyreness Peninsula,among elite,who trusted Columbus.Because every nobleman,who was close to monarchs of Spain and Portugal,had enough information about the coasts of the New World.It all looked like ready scenario.Vespucci was appointed head navigator (1508)of newly founded Castile after the death of Columbus with the support of the gonfaloner of Florence Pietro Soderi and authoritative persons of Spain.Most captains,navigators,cartographers and geographers now depended on him.Of course,coasts of the New World were named after Vespucci owing to his position and made-up letters.As if he reached coasts of the New World in 1497,he prepared a forged letter full of nonsenses with forged date in order to spread his lie in Europe.Vespucci wanted to prove that he reached America before Colum-bus.The political situation of Spain in the first year of the 16th century and Spanish monarchs’ regard for Columbus were advantageous for him.Everybody knew that,the admiral Columbus were brought to Spain with handcuffs   35 together with Bartolomeu and Diego after the third travel (1498-1500)and it proved that he had lost his prestige for monarchs.The bishop of Hispaniola (Haiti)Francisco de Bobadilla and his helpers tried to disgrace Columbus.The initial plan was to deprive him of most privileges,given to the Genuine sea traveler by monarchs of Spain.Because Spain couldn’t reconcile itself to the fact that,Columbus was the only heir of discovered lands.The condition was very good for ambitions of adventures.It is known that,some sea travelers organized expeditions to the south of the Caribbean Sea with the special task to conduct investigation there after mentio-ned mournful events.Columbus wasn’t aware of it.Those expeditions had to be led by sea travelers,who had joined Columbus during his travel to the coasts of the New World,in order to achieve success.The most well-known sea travelers were Alonso de Ojeda and Juan de la Cosa (1499),besides,Pedro Alonso (Peralonso)Nino (1499)and Vicente Yáñez Pinzón (1500),who joined the mission afterwards.Results of those travels kept secret and Columbus wasn’t aware of them,they were presen-ted to monarchs of Spain.Almost all privileges of Columbus were returned after he was fully exonerated.But the admiral was deprived of   36 being leader of discovered new lands according to the common consent.Nicolás de Ovando was declared a governor of “India” on September 3,1502.Everybody understood that,the admiral had lost previous authority.So,Vespucci misappropriated his achievements and declared that,the southern continent of the New World was discovered by him.He prepared forged documents and spread his letters in the world.The Florentine accountant gathered geographers and carto-graphers,who supported him,in order to be convincing.Martin Waldsemuller and the geography circle of Sen-Dye Vespucci had to attract attention of some foreign scientists in order make “his travels” official.He couldn’t reach top of the fame though he had great support in Spain.Major geographical discoveries were made successively.He had to spread information about disco-  37 vered lands and aborigines,who lived there.The winner would be the person,who could do it.The transatlantic travels had to be kept secret as they served state’s interests.Everybody,who would spread such information,had to be judged as a traitor.But Vespucci didn’t fear and spread information on the lands discovered on the other side of the ocean.It means that,he showed irresponsibility by doing it.But he wasn’t punished for spreading state secret,vice verse,was appointed head navigator of Castile by monarchs of Spain.A geography circle was established in the city Sen-Dye of Lotharingia in France in 1507.Several young scientists were members of the circle.One of them,Martin Waldsemuller published “Introduction to cos-mography” with two letters of Amerigo Vespucci (in Latin).The name “America” was used in that book for the first time.The author wrote that,three parts of the Earth were named Europe,Asia and Africa.Martin Waldsemuller wrote:“Now… The forth part was disco-  38 vered by Amerigo Vespucci and I don’t think that anybody will be against naming it America”.1 Lines from the book written in 1507 by Waldsemuller.It is suggested to name new continent America in favor of Vespucci – wise person This step required great courage as mentioned territory was discovered by Columbus.Most scientists of the 1 İ.П.МагiDоviç,В.İ.МагiDоviç.Оçеrкi pо iсtоrii геогrафiçескiх оtкrıtiy,II tоm.Москvа,“Пrосvеhеniе”,1982.сtr.79   39 countries,located in the Pyrenees Peninsula,knew that the forth continent was discovered by Columbus even though the Genoese admiral named it “India”.According to mentioned authors,the German carto-grapher and geographer Martin Waldsemuller (1470-1521)didn’t want to cast a shadow on the reputation of Columbus though Amerigo Vespucci,Alonso de Ojeda,Vicente Pinzón,Diego Lepe and other sea travelers weren’t known as travelers,who organized expeditions to the new lands,by some geographers.But some of them began to appreciate the Florentine cosmographer as Columbus after letters of Vespucci,which were spread in most countries of Europe.According to them,Columbus investigated the Old World – tropical part of the Eastern Asia,but Vespucci investigated the new continent – “the forth part of the Earth” – New World.But in spite of it,there was a striking difference between them.Because,Christopher Columbus could reach the Atlantic Ocean in the west first of all.Wise and idealist scientists knew it very well.Members of the geography circle of Sen-Dye accepted Vespucci’s letters as information about discovery of the new continent.If the new continent was discovered,it had to be named.If Waldsemuller didn’t make mentio-  40 ned speech in Sen-Dye because he was prompted to do so,he had to name the new continent,discovered by Columbus in 1492,Colombia instead of America.But the scientist chose unexpected name for it.The purpose of Waldsemuller’s scientific work was to name America.He had added his map to his work.Which sources were used by Waldsemuller when he prepared that map? Were there such maps in Lotharingia or territories around? There may be maps in Lotharingia and other territories,but the map “made” by Waldse-muller couldn’t be found in France,Holland or England.It is known that,most maps of territories,located in several parts of the Earth,could be found in large trade ports,located on the coasts of the Mediterranean Sea,including centers of culture and religion of cities,where important scientists,humanists and theologians lived.But number of maps of coasts of the New World,was limited and they were kept in important administrative buildings under special control.It was almost impossible to spread those maps.Then,how could Waldsemuller get that map? It was great responsibility for all researchers to introduce it as an author.As I mentioned above,number of maps of coasts of the New World was limited.But that map included exact   41 latitudes and longitudes.The word “America” was on such an exact map.There is no doubt that,such map couldn’t be made by Waldsemuller.Waldsemuller and his colleague Matthias Ringmann,who worked in Sen-Dye-de-Voj,worked on small maps.Maps had 12 segments and they were printed on one paper.A globe with 12 sm diameter appeared when papers were approached to each other.The map made by Martin Waldsemuller and Matias Ringman,which was consisted of 12 segments   42 Only 4 copies of maps,consisting of segments,were known.Three of them were in Minneapolis,Offenburg and Bavaria State Library of Munich.The forth was sold for 1 million dollars by auction “Christis” in 2005.The original map,remained till the present day,was consisted of 12 parts (planks).Map’s original title was “Universalis Cosmographia Secundum Ptholomaei Traditionem et Americi Vespucii Alioru[m]que Lustra-tiones”.Its translation is “Map of the world made on the new lands added by Amerigo Vespucci with the method of Ptolemy”.As existence of today’s Northern America wasn’t proved at the beginning of the 16th century,Martin Waldsemuller was obliged to write “America” on the South America.If Vespucci really sailed to the coasts of Florida as some historians wrote,this name could be written on the Northern America too.But as Spanish and Portuguese sea travelers investigated only northern and eastern coasts of the South America and never were in the territories,located on the northern coasts of the Caribbean Sea,it was difficult to name that territory.The Florentine accountant sent his letters to the most influential person of the Apennine Peninsula.He was a   43 statesman of the Republik of Florense Piero di Soderini.Piero di Soderini sent the letter to the duke of Lotharingia Rene II after he get it.Waldsemuller's decision caused great lie Rene II (1451-1508),who supported geographical discoveries,geographers and cartographers,was called “Protector of the geographical discoveries” in Brockhaus and Efron Encyclopedic Dictionary.The duke,who was enough influential in France,supported young intellect-tual persons Liud,Ringman and Waldsemuller,who lived in Sen-Dye,located near Strasburg.According to the historical sources,Waldsemuller,whose pseudonym was “Sheep-dog”,gathered experien-ce on cartography.He could complete his greatest project – “Great world map”,whose area was 3 square meters,in 1507.  44 It is supposed that,Vespucci’s tractate,spread in France,was a turning point in Waldsemuller’s outlook.That’s why,he wrote “America” for the southern continent,discovered at the end of the 15th century,on his map.As if Vespucci was a celebrated sea traveler in Europe before his letters appeared.Everybody,who was member of the expedition,including captain,navigator,boatswain etc.could write such letters.Could the continent be named in honor of that person without clarifying details then? Of course,this was an irresponsible step.But Waldsemuller did it.Even the map appeared,which included lines of the southern continent.How it could happen? Did Waldsemuller live in Spain and Portugal for a long time,traveled to the coasts of the New World within different expeditions? How could he draw lines of the coasts of the New World? Mentioned map was published in thousand copies and I think the purpose was to disgrace Columbus in Spain.It turns out that,the German cosmographer,who was interested in discovery of the coasts of the New World,wasn’t aware of the activity of Columbus and discovered new territories.Though Columbus,Bartolomeu Dias,Vasco da Gama,Pedro Cabral and others were main   45 participants of the major geographical discoveries,population of Europe knew almost nothing about it.But Waldsemuller had to be aware of such discoveries as he was a researcher,cartographer and scientist.It means that,the German scientist realized the scenario prepared in Spain in order to conceal facts.Waldsemuller named the territory,discovered by Columbus,“America”.Vespucci,who knew psychology of scientists working on the history of geographical discoveries,knew that,any information about new lands,discovered on the other side of the Atlantic Ocean and any map of those terri-tories,would excite them very much.The map,intro-duced to the world by Waldsemuller,was more exact than the map of Claudius Ptolemy and Paolo Toscanelli.In general,the stage after the geography circle of Sen-Dye,is full of contradictions.Members of the circle began to name discovered land “America” according to the map of Waldsemuller in 1507.But the Holland carto-grapher Iohan Roys,who had doubts about it,named discovered southern continent “Land of the Holy Cross or New World” on his map made in 1508 and tried to rebuild just by the way.Roys tried to gather scientists around himself.In spite of it,as the map,made by the   46 The map made in 1507 by Waldsemuller   47 German cosmographer,was more exact,it was copied and spread in Europe.The interesting detail of the map was an exact description of the western coast of the South America,Cape Horn and Pacific Ocean.Though,Europeans hadn’t investigated those parts of the continent before 1507.The Earth was consisted of two – Southern and Northern Hemispheres on mentioned map.But this wasn’t main characteristics of the map.Waldsemuller connected small territory in the north with the large territory in the south by means of the canal.The territory in the north was named “unknown land” and the territory in the south was named “America”.Unknown western coasts of mentio-ned territories were drawn with straight lines.There was an ocean between the North Pole and 400 south latitude and Cipango Island (Japan)between the coast and 100 west longitude.The new continent was described as a barrier between Asia and Europe,but not part of Asia.According to mentioned map,it was necessary to pass the New World through 600 north latitude in order to go to Asia through the western way.North-west passage was described for going to the Pacific Ocean from the   48 Atlantic Ocean.But this map didn’t stimulate carto-graphers and geographers of that time.1 How could it happen? Could Waldsemuller go ahead of the time? It has been proved that,it was impossible.Then,how could lines of the coast,located below La-Plata Gulf of the South America,be drawn on the map? Description of the North America explained most questions.It proved that it was possible to reach the Pacific Ocean and “Spice Islands” by sailing towards the north-west from the Atlantic Ocean.I can’t accept mentioned facts because of my resear-ches.A lot of questions appear:1.Why did Waldsemuller include letters in his scientific work without reading them though he knew that,the new continent was discovered by Columbus? Everybody knew that,though Vespucci had traveled to the coasts of the New World,he never had important positions within expeditions.But Columbus participated in the expeditions,which were important for the history of geographical discoveries,four times and always was the first person.So,Waldsemuller hadn’t to name the 1 İ.П.МагiDоviç,В.İ.МагiDоviç.Оçеrкi pо iсtоrii геогrафiçескiх оtкrıtiy,II tоm.Москvа,“Пrосvеhеniе”,1982.сtr.79-80   49 new continent in honor of the Florentine accountant instead of Columbus.2.After analyzing speeches made by Waldsemuller in Sen-Dye,I came to the following conclusion:The German scientist and Vespucci knew each others.They kept it secret as didn’t want to cause doubt in elite and scientists.Vespucci was a very ambitious man and never gave up striving for his purposes.Columbus also was ambitious and had his own purposes.Vespucci tried to get high positions.His relations with Savonarola,Lorenzo de' Medici,Piero Soderini,C.Berardi,Christopher Colum-bus,Alonso de Ojeda,Gonçalo Coelho,Gaspar de Lemus and other influential persons prove it.Owing to those relations,Vespucci was aware of the circle in Sen-Dye,discussions on the coasts of the New World and naming the new continent.3.I suppose that,the Florentine accountant explained to Waldsemuller that,he had a significant role in discovery of the new continent and proved that mentio-ned continent was unknown land.Vespucci knew that the German cartographer needed new maps and offered him several expensive maps disinterestedly.But Waldse-muller had to explain his colleagues that,Vespucci had   50 an important role in discovery of the new continent and spreading important materials and secret maps on the discovery.The German scientist promised to speak about Vespucci’s “efforts” after he got important materials and secret maps about the discovery of the coasts of the New World.4.It seems that,Waldsemuller’s well-known map was made by Vespucci and given to the German scientist.And he named the new continent “America”.Perhaps Waldsemuller thought that,mentioned map had to be given him by Columbus,if unknown lands were disco-vered by the genius admiral.5.But why did Waldsemuller use Vespucci’s second letter in “Introduction to cosmography”.Because,according to that letter,as if the Florentine astronomer traveled to the coasts of the New World for the first time in 1497.It meant that,Vespucci reached the southern continent a year before the travel of Columbus.What’s the secret of it? The most surprising detail was the difference between traditions,outward appearances,clothes and behaviors of Hindus described in the letter (Vespucci described them as cannibals)and reality (in reality,they had to be like Hunduzs,Chinese and Japans)for members of the circle,  51 who listened the German scientist’s report.Afterwards,Waldsemuller introduced the map of the coasts of the New World in order to improve Vespucci’s reputation.He named the southern continent (South America)“Ame-rica” on that map without asking anybody.The Australian researcher Stefan Zweig,who analyzed mistakes made in investigation of Vespucci’s activity,had an interesting opinion:“The first mistake… Vespuc-ci’s name was written on the book “Paesi retrovati”.So,readers thought that,the new land was discovered by Vespucci,but not by Columbus.The second mistake:The word “Parias” was written in the Latin version instead of “Lariab”.And after it,everybody began to say that,Vespucci reached America before Columbus.The third mistake:The new continent was named in honor of Vespucci by simply basing on the 32-page letter”.1 After Medicis were banished from Florence,their enemy Soderini was declared gonfalonier of the country in 1502 and he was Vespucci’s friend.I think that,Waldsemuller was very glad when French version of Vespucci’s letter to Soderini was received in Lotharingia 1 С.Üvеyг.Соbrаniе соçinеniy v сеmi tоmах.ЗvеzDnıе çасı çеlоvеçесtvа.III tоm.Москvа,«ПrаvDа»,1963.сtr.433-434   52 and even included it in his book “Introduction to cosmography” and offered to name discovered land “America” instead of the New World.This name began to be memorized by people and scientists owing to the Florentine accountant’s letters.Does it mean that,Vespucci can’t be judged for this historical “unjust”.The map made by Gergard Mercator (1538).Lines of the North and South America was described on the map   53 Let’s analyze maps made by Mercator in 1538 and 1541.He made a great mistake by naming the southern continent America.Mercator had to investigate Vespuc-ci’s activity before making decision.At least he had to look through materials of the Florentine accountant’s “first” travel to the coasts of the New World.It could help him to understand Vespucci’s fraud.Mercator’s mistake is unforgivable.Because his decision of 1538 made the southern continent to be named America.The cartographer could name discovered land “Colombia” and have a significant role in rebuilding of justice.But he didn’t do that.Besides,Mercator could avoid this responsibility using some factors.The northern part of the continent was named America before his decision.If he renamed that part,he would be criticized by some scientists,intellect-tuals,cartographers and seamen.Mercator said about it:“The new continent was named rightly as Vespucci had a significant role in discovery”.But the scientist had to be conscientious.He had an opportunity to name the continent “Colombia” in honor of Columbus.His deci-sion was very decisive.  54 Naming the forth continent America was a great injustice One of the most important events happened at the beginning of the 16th century was naming the continent,discovered by Christopher Columbus on October 12,1492,America.That name began to appear on the maps without consent of the most leading scientists.Nobody paid attention to this event though it was enough urgent at first.That territory began to be named America on 80 percent of maps made by European cartographers.The name “America” began to be serious problem after it was often seen on the maps.Discovered continent wasn’t mentioned as America in Spain,Portugal and Italy and it was temporarily mentioned as the coasts of the New World in Europe.Most cartographers and geographers of the Pyreness Peninsula mentioned that,it was difficult for them to name the continent discovered by Columbus America.They named the new continent “New World” or “Land of the Holy Cross”.Some of them did it even after the name “America” appeared.Though a lot of books and scientific articles have been written about Vespucci,there are still oppositions about   55 his activity.Though the Florentine accountant has supporters,he has opponents at the same time.Why do such oppositions exist? Are there a lot of obscurities in the biography of Vespucci that cause to doubt his successes in major geographical discoveries? But one of the largest continents of the world has been named in honor of him?! The Florentine accountant acquainted with the well-known sea traveler several years after he moved to Spain.But he hadn’t participated in the travels towards the coasts of the New World organized by Columbus.In spite of it,Vespucci was aware of results of the admiral’s travels.He created relations with geographers and cartographers and used their helps for realization of his plans.Though investigation of western coasts of Africa by the Portuguese wasn’t so important in Europe during the authority of the Prince Enrique,travels of Columbus,Bartolomeu Dias,Vasco da Gama and Pedro Cabral caused great resonance among scientists in the 90th years of the 15th century.Why was that continent named “America” instead of “Colombia”? Everybody knows that,it was discovered by Columbus.Vespucci reached it seven years after the   56 travel of the Genoese traveler.The specialists of this field had to prevent this injustice.The reason of this injustice was to name lands,located on the other side of the Atlantic Ocean,in honor of Vespucci,in order to steal fame of Columbus.Cartographers and scientists created desperate situa-tion for realistic persons by naming the new continent America.It would be just to name it Atlántida.Columbus had almost found Atlántida lost in the ancient times.Most scientists of the ancient times and Middle Ages thought that,Atlántida was situated in the western part of the Atlantic Ocean.At least,the northern continent could be named Colombia as Columbus had devoted most of his life to this discovery.It should be noted that,other cartographers were more careful than Waldsemuller.There weren’t the words “canal” and “America” on the map of the Holland Johan Roys (1508)and the southern continent was named “Land of the Holy Cross or New World”.The southern part of the continent was named “Unknown land” on the map of the Pole cartographer Jan Stobnicki,made in Krakow in 1512.This map was completely different from the map made by Waldsemuller.The name “Ame-rica” wasn’t used there.It isn’t difficult to understand   57 the reason.Some scientists didn’t want to use Vespucci’s name in order to prevent injustice.Johan Roys It proves that,scientists and cartographers didn’t agree with Waldsemuller’s opinion.The doubts began to justify themselves.It seems that,the document,where the coasts of the New World,discovered by Columbus,were named America,was given to the German scientist by someone.Perhaps,Vespucci had an exceptional role in this process as it was advantageous for the Florentine accountant.  58 Unfortunately,the king of Spain Ferdinand of Aragon was jealous of the well-known sea traveler.Discovered continent could be named in honor of Columbus if he requested great privileges from the king.Vespucci could use this conflict very well.After fraud of Vespucci was exposed (30th years of the 16th century),geographers and cartographers go great opportunities to liquidate the historical injustice.Everybody could use these opportunities,including well-known cartographer Gerard Mercador.Unfortunately,he couldn’t do it.As I mentioned above,maps,made by Mercador in 1538 and 1541 (According to the map made in 1538,he had named the northern continent of the New World America)caused great injustice.But of course,the Flemish cartographer’s purpose wasn’t like that.Gerard Mercador (1512-1594)(Kremer)was a Flemish cartographer and had been living in Netherlands and Germany (in Duysburg since 1552)for a long time.He knew almost nothing about processes going on in Spain and Portugal.Vespucci was known abroad owing to his “third” travel (1501-1502).  59 Gerard Mercador (1512-1594)  60 Atlas Gerard Mercador (1606)Some scientists,especially J.Margolis thought that,Waldsemuller’s map stimulated heliocentric theory of the Pole scientist Nicolaus Copernicus.Such exact map,proving that the earth is spherical,was considered initial visual document.The real author of Waldsemuller’s map was unknown,as the secret of lands described on the map made by the Turkish admiral Piri Reis in 1513.  61 In general,only three copies of Waldsemuller’s map have remained till the present time.One of these copies was got from one of the German princes by the Library of Congress of the USA.That map was found from the prince’s family castle 100 years ago.But the auction “Christies” began to look for the forth copy of mentioned map and it turned out that the valuable document was in unknown businessman’s personal collection.Even the owner of the collection learned it from the newspaper.I didn’t know the result of mentioned auction,but I know that,so many collectioners,universities and museums wanted to get the map.If such historical material was got by universities and museums,they could create favorable ground for its investigation.But researches give no result when such important material is kept in personal collections.The globes began to be created after maps of the coasts of the New World began to appear in the science centers of Europe in the second decade of the 16th century.Though the travel of Ferdinand Magellan took place in 1519-1522.In spite of it,most scientists tried to prove that the Earth was spherical and showed it on their globes.  62 I want to mention that,the talented mathematician and geographer of his time Johannes Schöner from Nurem-berg (1477-1547)is known as the inventor of globes (Earth and Sky).His globes made in 1515,1520,1523 and 1533 were interesting for the scientists.Even Antarc-tica was described in his globe made in 1520 though that continent was discovered 300 years later.The scientist’s globe made in 1523 wasn’t known by the world community for a long time and only the examination conducted in 1927 proved that its author was Schöner.The North America was described as part of Asia in the globe made by Schöner in 1533 (Weimar Globe)and lines of Antarctica was drawn on it.Magellan Strait was described on the manuscript prepared by him in 1515 before its discovery.But it was on the 40th parallel,instead of 53th.The canal between continents wasn’t seen on the globe made in 1515.Parias (the territory,located in the north of Venezuela and Guiana),discovered during the third expedition of Columbus (1498-1500)in 1498 in the south of Anthill Islands,was described as a large island and was named America.Japan,separated from the island with the strait,was described in the west of the great island.The state Brazil,located in the continent looking   63 like the triangle,was separated from Antarctica with the strait.Johannes Schöner (1477-1547)  64 Besides the globe,maps of lands named America began to appear.Number of such maps was increasing before the 20th century of the 16th century.The common feature of them was name of the southern continent.It was named America on those maps.The thoughts on the fact that,the territory located in the north of the Caribbean Sea was “new” and “unknown” and it was part of the continent,appeared after travels of the 10-20th years of the 16th century.The description of mentioned continent began to be created according to the real discoveries made during the travel of Giovanni da Verrazzano.1 It is already known that,the word “America” was used for the northern continent (North America)by the Flemish cartographer Gerard Mercador.He named the southern continent “southern part of America” and northern continent “northern part of Ame-rica” on the map made in 1538.Afterwards the scientist decided to divide the word “America” into two parts and name the northern continent “Ame” and the southern continent “Rika” on his map made in 1541 as the terri-1 İ.П.МагiDоviç,В.İ.МагiDоviç.Оçеrкi pо iсtоrii

it,everybody named mentioned continent America.The word “America” began to be used on all globes and maps after the second half of the 16th century,besides maps made by the Spanish scientists,according to the maps made by Mercador – so,fame of Vespucci spread in the world and Columbus began to be forgotten.But Spanish and Italian scientists continued to name the continent “New World”,“West India” etc.Of course,I didn’t want to forget comparing opinions of other scientists and maps made by cartographers.There were real reactions against the injustice of the new name.J.Schöner accused Vespucci of forgery after 1515.According to him,the Florentine accountant deceived most people.Besides,it was written by Bartolomé de las Casas in “General history of India”.Accusations against Vespucci were written openly.I agree with Bar-tolomé de las Casas.Naming whole continent America is an injustice.Some adventurous scientists deceived even their colleagues.This situation was created by Vespucci.What is the reason of this conclusion? You may think that Vespucci had significant role in “enigmatic dis-  67 covery” of America.Sharply criticizing his activity may be seen unjust.I have to explain my conclusions as there may be doubts.Columbus died on May 20,1506.Newly discovered continent was named a year after his death.Later this idea was supported by other geographers and carto-graphers.If Vespucci was an honest man,he could offer to name at least northern continent in honor of Columbus by saying the truth.He had to remember that once they were friends.He preferred to keep silence instead of to propagate the Genoese seaman’s works and important discoveries.Vespucci was an ambitious and envious person,who didn’t appraise other person’s works.He tried to show important results as his own successes.The Florentine accountant tried to misappropriate important results achieved by another sea traveler on Brazilian coasts and proved that he was an adventurer.Of course,there are people,who don’t agree with me.They may say that,he is one of the most important persons of the history.As if Vespucci proved that,the land,located on the other side of the Atlantic Ocean isn’t Asia,but is an unknown land for the Old World.So,discovered land was named in his honor.I can’t agree   68 with this thought.The fact that,the southern continent was an unknown land was proved by Juan de la Cosa – participant of the second expedition of Columbus (1493-1496),but not Vespucci.I want to add that,the coasts of the New World were named America in the period,when Vespucci was a head navigator of Castile (1508-1512).It means that,his position and relations with cartographers and geographers helped him a lot.The position of the head navigator was given to the person,who hadn’t achieved any important success in travels Following question appears when this issue is discusses:What had Vespucci done to gain the position of the head navigator of Castile? He didn’t lead any expedition and didn’t participate in important travels.Though the experienced traveler Juan Díaz de Solís,who was appointed the head navigator in 1512,and Sebastian   69 Cabot,who was a head navigator in 1516,had led great navies traveled to the other side of the Atlantic Ocean.Juan Solís discovered Jucatan Peninsula and the coastline,located below it,together with Vicente Yáñez Pinzón in 1508.He was killed by indigenous Hindus near the outfall of Parana and Uruguay Rivers when disco-vered La Plata for the second time in 1516 (according to the experts of the history of geography,the Portuguese seamen Stephen Frosh and Juan de Lisboa reached La Plata in 1512 for the first time).They deserved men-tioned position,but Vespucci’s appointment was unex-pected even for aristocrats,who were close to the palace.What is the secret of it? Why was a merchant,who wasn’t popular among sea travelers,able to hold such post? Could the Florentine accountant get that post by means of the bribe as he was an heir of Cuanoto Berardi after his death? We know that,Vespucci had left Spain for some unknown results and returned to Spain only in 1504.May be,the Florentine accountant was sent by the establishment of secret service with the special task and gained respect of the Spanish leaders.When citizenship of Castile was given to Vespucci in 1505,there was such comment on the official document:“For the services for Castile”.It proves that,the king   70 Ferdinand of Aragon was satisfied with services of Vespucci and believed that,he would serve the state faithfully.What were those services? According to the historical documents,he never led any navy and hadn’t great successes as Columbus.Some specialists had doubts about the expression “For the services for Castile” used when citizenship of Castile was given to Vespucci.“In XIX this approach allowed Vespucci’s opponents to accuse him.They said that,he had enter Portugal as the citizenship of Castile and sailed to Brazilian coasts as a spy”.Activity of Amerigo Vespucci during last two years is unknown.He sailed to the West India in one of the vessels of Spain as a captain or official or participated in preparation of three vessels in Seville for the next expedition,which was postponed later.1 Vespucci declared that he had participated in two expeditions towards the South America and wrote it on his forged letters.I think his job was in ports of Portugal.There is no doubt that,Vespucci went to Lisbon as the authoritative representative of Berardi’s trade center,but 1 АvаDəеvа Е.Н.,ЗDаnоviç Л.İ.Сtо vеliкiх mоrеplаvаtеlеy.Москvа,«Веçе»,1999 г.сtr.76.  71 not as the cosmographer and cartographer and offered to finance one of expeditions.It seems that such proposal satisfied the king Manuel I and he agreed with some compromises.All events prove that he could be a finan-cer of the expedition of Gonçalo Coelho,but not cosmo-grapher,captain and navigator.That’s why,Vespucci could get exact information on the activity of mentioned expedition.He went to Lisbon with another purpose.My hypothe-sis is like that.The Spanish didn’t want vessels of other countries to enter the Caribbean Sea when they discovered islands of this sea.Mentioned territory began to be controlled by the Spanish according to the Treaty of Tordesillas signed in 1494.But the Spanish monarchs feared vessels of other countries,especially Portugal to enter the Caribbean Sea and fleece aborigines.The Spanish were sure that,the Portuguese entered restricted waters and conduct there illegal works.So,the Spanish spies went to the ports of Portugal and tried to learn coasts,which the vessels,which sailed towards the New World,chose as the destination.But they needed to enter the staff of expedition and prepare report on the expedition in order to prevent doubts.  72 Vespucci could go to the other side of the Atlantic Ocean owing to his financial capital without any difficulties within Gonçalo Coelho’s expedition.Though mentioned expedition couldn’t reach restricted zone,he was sure that some vessels of the Portuguese sailed to the coasts of the Caribbean Sea with the purpose of intelligence.  73 There was a rumor that,as if the Portugal sea travelers conducted investigation works in the north of the Caribbean Sea.There is an appendix of the land area above the left corner of Cantino’s map.According to some researchers,mentioned territory is Florida,but others think that it is Yucatan Peninsula.As it is known,Alberto Cantino lived in Lisbon when he made his well-known map in 1502 and got most information from the Portugal sea travelers.Though the Holland historian E.Roukema had mistakes in meri-dianal line in 1956,he noted that it was Yucatan Peninsula.The historian,who analyzed names of areas on the maps,had come to the following conclusion:“A Portugal expedition met the northern coast of Yucatan Peninsula by accident when sailed to the west across Florida on 89 degrees longitude in April of perhaps 1503,then continued to sail towards the west and looked for the passage to the ocean (The Pacific Ocean – R.D.).The Portuguese went round the north-east appendix of the peninsula and sailed towards the south till they found Chetumal Bay without noticing Cozumel.Then they passed by Coral reefs around Tenerife,left Honduras in the south-east and reached the coast near Cape Camarón (16 degrees northern latitude)on June 18.They left the   74 coast of the Central America in front of Cabo Gracias a Dios”.1 The travel of the Portuguese towards the coasts of Honduras and Mexica at the beginning of the 16th century had important results and Cantino could prepare his well-known map almost owing to that unknown expedition.Did Vespucci play any role in gathering such important information? It seems that,he hadn’t any difficulties in this job as a spy.Don’t forget that,Vespucci had great capital and was able to be close to the influential persons,working at the nautical establishments,owing to it.After gathering such important information,the king Ferdinand of Aragon ordered in 1512 to arrest the staff of unknown vessels,which tried to enter territories controlled by the Spanish.This order was first applied to the Portugal captain and sea traveler Stephen Frosh.Several other vessels of Portugal were also taken and so,travelers of other kingdoms didn’t approach those coasts.The Portugal organized secret travels to the Caribbean Sea and made maps of coastlines.They wanted to know towards which meridian did the lands,located on the 1 İ.П.МагiDоviç,В.İ.МагiDоviç.Оçеrкi pо iсtоrii геогrафiçескiх оtкrıtiy,II tоm.Москvа,“Пrосvеhеniе”,1982.сtr.107   75 western coasts of the Caribbean Sea extend as the Spanish kept those coordinates secret.Vespucci met Columbus in 1504 after completion of his forged letters and learned his secret by consoling disgraced admiral.Perhaps,Columbus showed him the map of the forth continent and his notes made during the travels.But Vespucci showed those materials to the officials,who tried to disgrace Columbus.Vespucci was promoted owing to such services,which allowed him to win Ferdinand of Aragon’s confidence.What were functions of the head navigator of Castile? He had to test navigator candidates,give them diplomas for participation in serious travels and control preparation of globes and maps,get secret maps,made according to the materials,brought from the coasts of the New World,and keep them,give permissions to captains,etc.Vespucci got this position in 1508 and the land,discovered by Columbus,began to be named in honor of the head navigator after it.Most travelers,expedition commanders,experienced captains and navigators of Spain began to be led by him.Geographers,cosmo-graphers and cartographers had to ask Vespucci when they wanted to see maps and materials brought from the coasts of the New World.He gave secret materials to the   76 cartographers and tried to prove that he discovered the continent for the first time.The scientists,who could get permission to look through important materials,had to spread this idea.All these processes were planned.The Chamber of Issues on India (Casa de la Contra-tacion de las İndias)was founded according to the doctrine of January 20,1503.The Chamber’s functions included functions of the Trade Council and Hydro-graphic Office.Its purpose was to regulate trade relations in the territories,located on the coasts of the New World.Geography and cosmography department was founded according to the decree of August 8,1508.It is considered the first Hydrographic Office.One of its main functions was to organize drawing of lines of the New World and special council had to control this job.Merchants,ruined Hidalgos and adventurers didn’t pay attention to the decrees and security measures and thronged to the New World with different interesting ways.Trade of maps was developed in almost all port cities and buyers preferred to buy new maps instead of old ones.As sea maps were too expensive and were tracked by the state officials,they were kept in the most secret places.  77 Diogo Ribeiro's Carta Universal (1529).Vatican Library.  78 Authority of Spain ordered to make a standard map (Padron Real)in order to control mapping of new territories.A map had to be made under the leadership of the head navigator of Castile and control of the commis-sion consisted of navigators.Members of the commission were well-known navigators Juan Díaz de Solís and Vicente Yáñez Pinzón and they were considered deputies of Vespucci.The standard map had to liquidate contra-dictions between cartographers,who made mistakes during the travel on West Sea (Atlantic Ocean),and navigators and create ground for creation of exact maps.Expeditions brought maps full of mistaken information and incorrect calculations.It was difficult to test them and to be sure that they were exact as mentioned materials were brought from suspicious places.According to Veitia Linahen,official maps,made by the chamber,were kept in the trunk under two locks having two keys.One of the keys was kept by the head navigator and the second was kept by the head cosmo-grapher.Sebastian Cabot – one of the foreign experts,who had worked for Spain,tried to learn secret of the mythical strait between England and Venice and favori-tes of the king of Spain Charles V were proud of knowing short way to Moluccas.After it,Charles V sig-  79 ned a decree prohibiting appointment of foreigners as a navigator or assistant navigator.So,preparation of the standard map went on.Perhaps,it was a large-scale map prepared for the wall of the Alcazar of Seville.“All discovered lands and islands of India belonging to the authority of Spain” had to be described on the map.Every navigator,who sailed to the other side of the ocean,had to note every land,island,bay,port and other important elements on his map.Navi-gators had to present their maps to the head navigator as soon as they returned to Spain.Navigators couldn’t use non-official maps,otherwise they had to pay fine in the amount of 50 doubloons.Besides,employees of mentioned office had to control works of publishers,who published maps and sold them,and publishers had to have patience with monopoly in the map trade.Control on the standard map was trusted to Amerigo’s nephew Juan Vespucci and Juan Solis.They had to control prices of maps determined by the chamber.It proves that,Columbus and his colleagues might present the maps made on the coasts of the New World to the Chamber of Issues on India (Casa de la Contra-tacion de las İndias).So perhaps,Vespucci was aware of the maps made by his countryman.  80 According to the experts,Columbus thought that,lands he had discovered were part of Asia and his mistake was corrected by Vespucci several years later.As if the Florentine accountant reached mentioned conti-nent during his fictive first travel (1497-1498)and understood that,found territory was the fourth continent,which was unknown for the Old World.But it was known by some persons that,another Italian traveler had reached the fourth continent first of all.This traveler was Giovanni Caboto.But Waldsemuller named it “Ame-rica” in honor of Vespucci.Some persons mention that America wasn’t named in honor of Vespucci,it has another origin.This theory was first mentioned by Alfred Hudd of Bristol in 1908.He wrote that,the newly discovered continent was named in honor of the rich merchant from Bristol Richard Amerike.He was from popular and rich family.As it is known,Giovanni Caboto moved to London from Genoa in 1484.He went to Bristol in 1495 in order to organize travel to the East and acquainted with Richard Amerike when looked for a sponsor.Richard Amerike was elected sheriff of the city and led the kingdom’s customs for three years.Though this   81 position’s continuity is only one year.It means that,Amerike was very influential person.After John Cabot (he was called like that in England)presented the project to the sponsor,he went to London to visit the king Henry VII.The king trusted Amerike and gave permission to J.Cabot on March 5,1496.Cabot had to sail under the English flag and lands he would discover had to be property of England.According to some sources,Richard Amerike was a financer of the second transatlantic travel of John Cabot.34 days after the expedition left England,the Italian traveler reached Newfoundland or New Scotland province of today’s Canada.So,J.Cabot was the first European traveler,who could reach America in 1497.He had made maps of New Scotland and Newfoundland and brought them to his financer.There are still some materials about mentioned travel of 1497 in archives of Bristol.Henry VII gave permission for organization of the second expedition of J.Cabot for the following year and he started travel in 1498 with five vessels.The expedition faced with the strong hurricane on the coasts of the North America and only three vessels returned back to Britain.Two vessels drowned including J.Cabot.  82 A year later Sebastian Cabot went to the other side of the ocean in order to find his father and mapped the coasts line between Labrador Peninsula and Carolina.As the second expedition disappointed the English,they postponed investigation of the northeastern coasts of the fourth continent for some decades.The Spanish had an exact information on Cabot’s expedition instead of the English.The territories,located above Florida on Juan de la Cosa’s map,were described as the “northern lands of the English”.After that travel,the ambassador of Spain in London Pedro de Ayala wrote about the expedition,which looked for the islands of “Brazil” and “Seven Cities”,in his letter to the Spanish monarchs.Amerike was sure that,discovered land would be named in honor of him.But most scientists tried to deny this probability.That’s why,Waldsemuller named the fourth continent America in honor of Vespucci when he participated at the geography circle in Sen-Dye.R.Amerike’s name wasn’t even mentioned in the countries,located below La Manche.In spite of all these facts,so many persons were mentioned as discoverers of the New World as if somebody tried to shade the success of Columbus.All of   83 those candidates were Italians.Martha Gumilevskaya wrote about it:“The manuscript of the Venetian travelers Nicolo and Antonio Zeno was found in the 16th century.As if they reached northwestern coasts of America (there is incorrectness here,perhaps,M.Gumilevskaya tried to mention northeastern coasts)100 years before Columbus.Travelers found forgotten manuscript on the shelves of the Holy Mark Library in Venice and published it.Besides,they published the map made by brothers”.1 But after some years,it turned out that mentioned document was forged.Though everybody trusted “The book of Zeno brothers” for about 200 years and thought that Zeno brothers had discovered the fourth continent 100 years before Columbus.It is reality that,Sebastian Cabot reached the northern continent in the 16th century first of all and chose another name for that territory on the map he made.Of course,Waldsemuller named the fourth continent “Terra İncog-nita” (“Unknown land”)on his map made in 1513 after he analyzed all these facts.1 Qumilеvскаə M.B.Как оtкrıvаli mir.Москvа,«Деtскаə litеrаturа»,1977.сtr.114-115   84 The Atlantic Ocean was named differently in the countries,located in the west of Europe.The large water basin in the west of Europe was named “The Sea beyond the pillars of Hercules”,“Atlantic”,“Western Ocean”,“Sea of Darkness” and etc.on the maps.But the ocean began to be named the “Atlantic Ocean” after Waldse-muller did so in 1507.Suspicious moments in the letters written by Amerigo Vespucci According to the historical researches of the historians,only one of the letters written to Medici has remained till the present day.It is in Latin.It turns out according to the content of the letter that,it was written in March of April of 1503 – before the travel towards the New World.Vespucci’s supporter Medici died during that period.Perhaps there is a secret behind it.  85 In general,Medici played an important role in Ves-pucci’s carrier.The Florentine accountant used his name during all his meetings after he went to Spain.According to the historical facts,Vespucci deceived Medici by keeping some materials secret.The diary about Vespucci’s travels,published with the title “Quatuor navigationes”,was part of the larger work,which would be published later.But mentioned work was never published.According to some experts,Vespucci’s work would disappear after a while,but it was in the center of attention as it was republished in “Raccolta” or collection of new travels.That collection was published in six books by the anonymous publisher with the title “Mondo nuovo е paesi nuovamente retrovati da Alberico Vespuzio Florentino” in 1507 in the city of Vicenza.At first,everybody thought that,the author was Francanzano de Montalbodo,but afterwards it turned out that,the book was published by the Venetian cosmographer and cartographer Alessandro Tsortsy.Afterwards mentioned collection was published in Latin in Milan in 1508,in German by the doctor Ruhammer from Nuremberg in the same year,and in French in 1516.Vespucci’s work on his travels “Cosmographiao introductio etc.,insuper quatuor Americi Vespucii   86 navigationes” was translated from French into Latin by Waldsemuller and was published under publisher names Gilacomila or Ilacomila.As the German cosmographer’s book attracted attention,it was published for four times (1507,1509,1535 and 1554).These books caused injus-tice.Scientists knew that,Waldsemuller named disco-vered continent America,besides spreading mentioned letters in Europe.Most cartographers began to name the continent as Waldsemuller.Amerigo Vespucci’s letters were published as a bro-chure with the title “Mundus Novis” (“New World”).All these processes were in favor of the Florentine accountant even after his death and he began to be known as the traveler,who discovered the New World.The Spanish officials,who worked against Columbus,had a significant role in this result.I didn’t mean that Vespucci didn’t play any role in sea travels.He did something of course.He used successes of persons,who led expeditions he participated.As if he was a cosmographer,navigator and commander in “four” travels towards the new continent.Most people may deny facts I mention (the fact that Vespucci reached the coasts of the New World seven years after Columbus).According to the most sources,Vespucci reached the   87 The leaflet of the report (letter)made in 1505 by Vespucci   88 continent for four times:in 1497-1498,1499-1500,1501-1502 and 1503-1504.Two of those expeditions were organized by Spain and other two were organized by Portugal.According to mentioned facts,Vespucci didn’t rest for almost eight years and went to the hard transatlantic travels after a half-year delay.He had to be a hero to do so.Columbus,Vasco da Gama or other travelers never achieved it.Even Columbus rested for at least two years when he conquered the Atlantic Ocean.Vespucci’s result was impossible.The geography expert C.Baker wrote:“According to Vespucci,he had traveled for four times – in 1497,1499,1501 and 1503.Substantial and new analyzes prove that the first and fourth travels aren’t real”.Even some scientists didn’t believe that mentioned letter was written by Vespucci.But S.Sveyg tried to explain this situation.He wrote:“Some scientists ackno-wledge that,even if books,spread with Vespucci’s name,were really written by him,perhaps he didn’t participate at the travels described in those books.Maniagi (profess-sor Maniagi – R.D.)mentioned that,even if Vespucci really participated at mentioned travels,perhaps,books weren’t written by him.Then we can say that,Vespucci   89 didn’t boast of false successes,simply there were mate-rials shown as his writings.If we want to judge Vespucci,we have to base on his three original letters,instead of books “Mundus Novus” and “Quator Navigationes”.But those letters were called forged even by supporters of Vespucci”.1 Vespucci almost rewrite his biography when he moved to Portugal from Italy.He tried to make it interesting for everybody who would read in future.Dates of his four travels prove that they weren’t real.1.May 10,1497 – October 15,1498 2.May 16,1499 – September 8,1500 3.May 10,1501 – October 15,1502 4.May 10,1503 – June 18,1504 It is interesting that,dates of Vespucci’s three travels – I,III and IV – were same – May 10 and two of his expeditions – I and III – returned Europe on the same date.It is a strange coincidence.It looks so unbelievable.He only participated at the travel towards the coasts of 1 С.Üvеyг.Соbrаniе соçinеniy v сеmi tоmах.ЗvеzDnıе çасı

of Vespucci.As Vespucci participated at the travel to the New World organized by Alonso de Ojeda (May 16,1499 – Septem-ber 8,1500)as a merchant and wasn’t one of the leading figures of the expedition,it is injustice to remember the discovery of the Amazon River with his name.According to L.Slyozkin,“the expedition (Vespucci’s expedition – R.D.)returned to Lisbon on October 7,1502”.1 But Vespucci wrote that,they returned on Octo-ber 15.He didn’t mention name of the expedition leader when prepared his diary,but L.Slyozkin wrote that,the expedition was led by Gaspar de Lemus – leader of Pedro Cabral’s expedition.I will give detailed information about it below.After he went to Portugal from Spain,explained people around that,participated at two travels when he was in Spain and after returned to Spain,said that,he travelled to the New World within the expeditions of Portugal.Neither the Spanish,nor the Portugal could 1 Сlеzкin Л.Ö.Зеmlə Сvətого Кrесtа.Оtкrıtiе i zаvоеvаniе Бrаzilii.Москvа,«Наuка»,1970.сtr.33   91 control his services.The Florentine accountant unmasked himself as wrote his biography.Afterwards,Vespucci (1504)moved to Spain and lived there till the end of his life.I think there is no need to list all of those “facts”.We have already heard about those “historical events”.If Vespucci traveled to the New World for four times,who was commander of the expedition during the first travel? How many vessels were there within the expedition? Who were captains of those vessels? There isn’t any exact information about it.Because,such travel never took place.All those facts were made up by Vespucci.According to some sources,he participated at three travels after 1499 and never had high position.According to Las Casas,Vespucci was navigator of the second or third degree within the expedition organized by Alonso de Ojeda in 1499-1500 as he had some experience in navigation.The Florentine accountant hadn’t high position during other travels.So,he couldn’t have a role in any geographical discovery.He achieved fame owing to the letters written in 1503 and 1504.If Vespucci wasn’t controlled by the Spanish officials,why his letter wasn’t presented to the community for a   92 year? He had to show his letters to his supporters first of all,in order to prove his successes.So,the Florentine accountant’s letter was published for several times in 1504-1505.Stephan Sveyg’s book about Vespucci proves that he defended the Florentine accountant.As if the report on Vespucci’s activity in Pyreness Peninsula was got by unknown publisher when it was sent to Florence and that publisher published it as a book.The publisher divided Vespucci’s travel made in 1499 into two parts in order to cause interest.As if the Florentine accountant traveled to the New World in 1497 and 1499.The publisher added some paragraphs of other traveler’s letters sent to Europe to the report in order to make it more interesting.This defense isn’t so effective.People,even officials knew nothing about letters written by the well-known travelers as B.Dias,Vasco da Gama,Christopher Columbus,Pedro Cabral and others when Vespucci’s first letter was published.So,publishers couldn’t get such materials,only travelers could give their materials to the publishers.New geographical discoveries were interesting for the European readers,but very little information was given to them:Reports of the travelers were published rarely   93 and were prepared cautiously.The Spanish authority had prohibited publication of materials about discoveries of Columbus and other travelers…1 Everything became clear after open struggle between supporters and opponents.When Vespucci was unmas-ked in the 18th century,his supporters tried to find original copies of his letters.S.Sveyg wrote:“Angelo Maria Bandini published first biography of the Florentine traveler – “Vita e lettere di Amerigo Vespucci” (“Life and letters of Amerigo Vespucci”)in Italian in 1745.Bandini could find out most documents.Francesco Bartolozzi presented the work “Ricerche istoriko-critiche” (“Historical critical research”)to the community in Italian together with Bandini in 1789…”2 1 T.Hәsәnov,Ә.Hacızadә.Coğrafiya tarixi,Bakı Univesitetinin Nәşriyyatı.Milli Virtual Kitabxana.Bakı,2001 sәh.25 2 С.Üvеyг.Соbrаniе соçinеniy v сеmi tоmах.ЗvеzDnıе çасı çеlоvеçесtvа.III tоm.Москvа,«ПrаvDа»,1963.сtr.426   94 Suspicious moments of Vespucci’s letters According to some sources,the king of Portugal Manuel I invited Vespucci to his country for participation in expeditions towards the Brazilian coasts according to his letters.So,the Florentine accountant,who accepted mentioned offer,traveled to the other side of the ocean in 1502 and 1504 under the flag of Portugal.But he left Portugal in 1505.According to such theories,Vespucci declared that,discovered territory wasn’t an island or part of Asia,it was new continent.Introduction of Vespucci’s letter on his third travel (1501-1502)is enough for proving it.“I rested in Seville after two travels as was so tired.I tried to collect my strength to return to the Land of Pearls (northeastern part of South America).The fortune didn’t estimate my efforts.Why did the king decide to invite me to his navy? I received his letter in Seville though don’t want to go to Portugal.The letter offers me to go to Lisbon and see the king.I will be awarded after the meeting.I said the herald,who brought the letter,that,I feel myself bad,as didn’t want to go to Lisbon.Then the king   95 sent my friend Julian di Bartolomeo del Giaconda,who lived in Lisbon.Julian came to Seville and I went to Lisbon at his request.Most of my acquaintances were displeased with my decision as didn’t want me to leave Castile.Everybody,even the king respected me in Castile.Unfortunately,I left Castile without meeting Ferdi-nand of Aragon and went directly to see the king of Portugal.Don Manuel was very glad to see me and asked me to participate in the expedition consisted of three vessels.The expedition had to discover new lands.I was obliged to accept the offer”.1 It isn’t difficult to understand Vespucci’s fraud.As if the king of Portugal invited a person,who hadn’t a significant role in any travel and wasn’t well-known,to Lisbon with great difficulty and asked him to participate in Gonçalo Coelho’s expedition.I think it will be interesting for you to read some expressions written in that funny letter:1.“I rested in Seville after two travels as was so tired.I tried to collect my strength to return to the Land of 1 В.Сtеüеnко-сосtаvitеlğ.Бriгаntinа – 71.Москvа,«МоlоDаə гvаrDiə».1971.сtr.369   96 Pearls (northeastern part of South America).The fortune didn’t estimate my efforts”.Vespucci mentioned that he had participated in the expedition of Alonso de Ojeda and was preparing for the next travel to the northern coast of the southern continent.But the king of Portugal Manuel I tried to send him to Brazilian coasts instead of the most well-known travelers of the kingdom.As if Vespucci was sorry for it.He explained his lie with following expressions:2.“I received king’s letter in Seville though don’t want to go to Portugal.The letter offers me to go to Lisbon and see the king.I will be awarded after the meeting.I said the herald,who brought the letter,that,I feel myself bad,as didn’t want to go to Lisbon”.It is impos-sible to believe in Vespucci’s words for every sensible person.How could the Florentine accountant be impor-tant for Manuel I? Why did he send herald for him? As if he was obliged to send herald back as was too tired.Vespucci proves his impudence.As if he rejected Manuel I and even warned him.He tried to prove his supporters,friends and relatives that,he was an important navigation expert.Vespucci wanted to show that he carried out important works in the most powerful   97 kingdom of the Pyreness Peninsula and his activity was controlled by the Spanish monarch Ferdinand of Aragon and the king of Portugal Manuel I attentively.King of Portugal Manuel I (1469-1521)  98 It should be noted that,specialists carried out many investigations in archives of the cities located in the Pyreness Peninsula in order to find Vespucci’s notes,but any document couldn’t be found in Portugal.One of Vespucci’s opponents used this opportunity and declared that,Vespucci lied when he said that,he got material support of Portugal.It means that,he was never invited to Portugal and wasn’t an important participant of any expedition.3.“Then the king sent my friend Julian di Bartolomeo del Giaconda,who lived in Lisbon.Julian came to Seville and I went to Lisbon at his request”.Don’t forget that,these sentences were written by the person,who wasn’t known by monarchs and officials of Portugal and Spain.It proves Vespucci’s fraud once again.As if Vespucci rejected the king of Portugal and he was obliged to send the adventurer’s friend Julian and could get the traveler’s consent owing to him.The Florentine accountant went to Portugal at his friend’s request.As if Vespucci left Spain unwillingly as he was held in respect by monarchs of Spain.4.“Unfortunately,I left Castile without meeting Ferdinand of Aragon and went directly to see the king of Portugal.Don Manuel was very glad to see me and   99 asked me to participate in the expedition consisted of three vessels”.Though according to the historical docu-ments,Vespucci never met with monarchs and even never approached their palaces.He could get into contact with Ferdinand of Aragon by means of officials.According to his sentences,he was one of the most important navigation experts and the king Manuel I had to appoint him for the expedition towards Brazilian coasts.Of course,the king Manuel I needed well-known,skilful and experienced seaman,who had participated at the travel to the west of the Atlantic Ocean for research of the coasts of the southern continent.The real candidates for this were Vicente Yáñez Pinzón,Pedro Alonso Nino,Diego Lepe,Alonso de Ojeda and other celebrated travelers,who were participants of the first and second expeditions of Columbus.Besides,they were aware of different secrets of those coasts.But Vespucci didn’t know anything about the coasts of the New World and hadn’t enough experience,skill and knowledge.Neither the king Manuel I,nor any monarch knowing nothing about navigation could send him for such important mission.  100 Pathos of the letter is obvious for even ordinary experts,not only for experts of history and geography.It doesn’t look as a reality.But it is known that,after Vespucci’s relation with the Spanish monarchs,other Italians also tried to prove their supporters that,they had business relations with the leaders of Spain.There is no need to prove Vespucci’s ruse.He tried to gather supporters even out of the kingdoms located in the Pyreness Peninsula in order to realize his insidious plan.He was known only within small frame,especially in the field of business.Are there scepticists,who doesn’t agree with my idea? But facts can’t be denied.The king Manuel I could invite well-known travelers,who had participated in expeditions of Portugal (Vasco da Gama,Paolo da Gama,Diego Dias,Duarte Pacheco Pereira,Pedro Alvares Cabral,Gonzalo Alvares,Nikolai Coelho,Pêro de Alenquer and others).He couldn’t need Vespucci as there were enough well-known travelers and professional seamen in Portugal.They could get more successes than Vespucci even though they didn’t know western coasts of the Atlantic Ocean.Vespucci could only be financer of the expeditions.I mean,the   101 Florentine accountant achieved fame by using names of monarchs of Spain and Portugal.I should note that,the letter,written to Medici by Vespucci,was like the story about barbarians he saw on the coasts of the New World,instead of the report of the travel towards Brazil.The expedition took place between May of 1501 and September of 1502.There isn’t exact information about the letter written to the statesman of the Republik of Florence Piero di Soderini.It isn’t known whether it was written in Italian or Latin.The letter,written in September of 1504 in Latin,was published in “Introduction to cosmography” of Martin Waldsemuller in April of 1507.The letter consisted of 32 pages and some engravings on the board.That letter was translated into Italian full of Spanish words,into French from Italian and into Latin from French.According to the most researches the letter,written to Soderini,was written by Vespucci in Italian.Latin version full of mistakes was published in 1507 with the title “Four travels”.Spanish version was published in 1503-1507,Italian version translated from Spanish was published in 1507,German version was published in 1508 and French version was published in 1516.It means that,Vespucci   102 Pietro di Soderini (1452-1522)couldn’t write the original letter in Italian.Because it was translated into Italian from Spanish.There is no doubt   103 that,it was written in Spanish.Because Vespucci lived in Spain and had to find supporters there.But he couldn’t do that as the Spanish knew,who first reached the coasts of the New World and played a significant role in great expeditions.That’s why,letters full of lies began to be translated into other languages.As originals of letters were interesting for specialists,archives of great cities of Europe were investigated and researches partly achieved their goals.It turned out after researches that,according to the Czech scientist Miloslav Stingl,one of the letters of Vespucci was published in Czech Republic before it was sent to the Apennine Pe-ninsula.1 According to that text,mentioned version was the oldest one.But corresponding information wasn’t spread widely.There are interesting ideas of M.Stingl:“Its (Letter’s – R.D.)author (perhaps,he was Slovak,but said that,he was from Hungary)was Mikulas Bakalarz – publisher of the most books in the Czech Republic.Bakalarz had a small book on America and Hindus “Stories on the New World and new lands”.Perhaps,Bakalarz’s stories were about 1504 as the 1 М.Сtinгl.İnDеyüı bеz tоmагаvкоv.Пеr.с çеşского В.А.Каmеnскоy i О.М.Маlеviçа pоD rеDакüiеy Р.В.Кincаlоvа.Москvа.«Пrогrесс»,1984,сtr.203   104 leader of Spain was “Queen Alzbeta” («Соçinеniе о nоvıх zеmləх i о Ноvоm Сvеtе,о коеm rаnее mı niкакiх izvесtiy nе imеli i niçего nе сlı-şаli»)in the book.Isabella died in 1504.We can surely say that,Bakalarz’s book was the first book of Czechoslovakia (The Czech Republic and Slovakia were within Czechoslovakia – R.D.)consisting of the elemen-tary ethnographic information about Hindus.These stories are unavailable for people,who are interested in Hindus”.1 There were a lot of Spanish words in the Italian version of Soderini’s letter.Then who was the real author of the letter? It turns out that,Vespucci wasn’t an author of mentioned letters.He simply tried to spread letters of other travelers.The letters were translated into many languages and published in different countries.Nobody could find originals of the letters.The first letter was written to the banker of Florence Lorenzo di Pierfrancesco de' Medici (1449-1492)at the end of 1502 or in March-April of 1503.But it was discovered a year later.Vespucci described his travel of 1 Сtinгl M İnDеyüı bеz tоmагаvкоv.Пеr.с çеşского В.А.Каmеnскоy i О.М.Маlеviçа pоD rеDакüiеy Р.В.Кincаlоvа.Москvа.«Пrогrесс»,1984,сtr.201   105 1501-1502 to the coasts of the New World in that letter.But he wrote in the second letter that,he had participated at four travels in 1497-1504.This letter was written to his friend – the statesman of the Republic of Florence Piero di Soderini.The Florentine accountant unmasked himself in his letters The specialists of the history of geographical disco-veries of USSR translated Vespucci’s letters from Latin into Russian and published in the book “Brigantine – 71”.After reading that book,I found out that,mentioned letter was compilation (perhaps,letters of Pero Vaz de Caminha,who had participated in expeditions of Colum-bus,Diego Chanca and even Cabral,were used)and the Florentine accountant unmasked himself with that letter.Vespucci wrote in his first letter:  106 1.“Sometimes we stayed with them for 15-20 days and they were very kind”.1 Vespucci mentioned in this letter that,aborigines were very kind.The same idea was noted in the diary of Columbus,prepared during his first travel.But Vespucci declared Europeans that,aborigines of the New World were cannibals and they had to be merciless against them.But this “sincerity” could harm him as most researchers,who had investigated social life of Hindus living on Brazilian coasts,had mentioned that,those people,who were far from culture,rules and morals were kind,hospitable and pleasant.According to the researchers,who investigated route of the faked travel of Vespucci,Hindus of Talamanca and Dikis groups of Costa Rica,Chibcha group of Honduras and Guatemala,Cocle,Veraguas and Chiric groups of Pana-ma,Choroteg group of Nicaragua and Toltec group of Nicaragua and Salvador weren’t cannibals.2.Vespucci wrote what he never saw and heard of Hindus in his first letter:“There are only gold there.There are too much gold in those countries,but we couldn’t bring any during the first travel.Inhabitants 1 В.Сtеüеnко-сосtаvitеlğ.Бriгаntinа – 71.Москvа,«МоlоDаə гvаrDiə».1971.сtr.344   107 said that there were too much gold in the country.They didn’t know that they are valuable.As I mentioned before,there are a lot of pearls too…”1 Let’s look through the diary of Columbus:“I tried to learn if they had gold.I saw that,they had hung gold on their noses.I learned that,I could meet with the king,who had a lot of gold,on the way to the south.I wanted to go to that place,but it turned out that,they didn’t know the way…2 There are a lot of pearls and precious stones too”.Besides him,Pero Vaz de Caminha also learned from Hindus that,there were gold in the country.But abori-gines,who lived on the coastline,didn’t have any gold.Existence of the gold was doubtful in general.If gold wasn’t interesting for aborigines,how could they notice the golden necklace of the admiral Pedro Cabral? But it was unnecessary for Caminha.He lied in order to cause interest in investors of the Old World,especially Portugal and sent this information to the king Manuel I.1 Сtеüеnко B.-сосtаvitеlğ.Бriгаntinа – 71.Москvа,«МоlоDаə гvаrDiə».1971.сtr.348 2 Сvеt Ə.М.Тексt vосprоizvеDеn pо izDаniö:Пutе-şесtviə Хriсtофоrа Коlumbа.Москvа,Qеогrафгiz,1956.сtr.92   108 Amerigo Vespucci is looking through diaries of the travelers   109 Perhaps,it was organized by the monarch of Portugal in order to attract rich financers,especially Italian bankers.So,it seems that,Gaspar de Lemus met Vespucci when he took that letter to the palace of Lisbon from Brazilian coasts and he learned about “Land of the Holy Cross”.Vespucci used that situation and began to prepare his plan.He started negotiations with officials of the palace for participation in the next expedition towards Brazilian coasts.He couldn’t be indifferent to the facts written by Caminha.Caminha wrote in the letter addressed to the king Manuel I:“Admiral was sitting on the chair when they (two aborigines – R.D.)got in the vessel… Admiral’s clothes were expensive and he had a golden necklace… They didn’t make a bow and proved that,weren’t able to talk to admiral or others.One of them looked at the admiral’s golden necklace attentively and pointed the coast of the island.Probably,he wanted to say that,there were gold in their country.He repeated the same thing when looked at the silver candlesticks”.1 1 Сlеzкin Л.Ö.Зеmlə Сvətого Кrесtа.Оtкrıtiе i zаvоеvаniе Бrаzilii.Москvа,«Наuка»,1970.сtr.24   110 As Vespucci was a bank employee,he could work with most documents,diaries and reports.Besides,he was professional in attracting people with pleasant talks,promises and mythical stories.There were some analo-gous moments in the letters of Columbus and Caminha.Both of them affirmed existence of gold in discovered territories.Sending expedition to the place full of gold was very profitable.Italian bankers understood it very well and tried to send their representatives there within expeditions.Vespucci wanted to know whether there were gold in mentioned territories or not? Columbus could bring some gold when returned from the first travel.But Gaspar de Lemus couldn’t bring any gold.That’s why,Vespucci went to Portugal and could meet with Lemus and Cabral.I think,Vespucci learned about the result of Cabral’s expedition when he went to Lisbon and tried to create relations with leaders of mentioned expeditions.For example,he became friend with Gaspar de Lemus.Though this fact is suspicious,some sources prove it.L.Slyozkin wrote in his book:“The new expedition of Portugal was led by Gaspar de Lemus,who had brought information on discovery of the cross island (Brazil – R.D.)to Portugal,and the Florentine seaman Amerigo   111 Vespucci.When they were in Cabral’s vessel,informed admiral that,their expedition went to the land he discovered.They even looked through goods brought by the captain.Lemus and Vespucci sailed towards south-west and went to the land,discovered by accident,after parted with Cabral”.1 L.Slyozkin was considered experienced researcher and he was persistent in his opinion.But it is advisable to explain it in detail.The only fact is known:Vespucci was the friend of Gaspar de Lemus and participated in secret expeditions to Brazilian coasts.3.The Florentine accountant lied in following phrases too:“If you want to know where the paradise is,I think,you can find it somewhere near these countries.These countries are situated in the south”.2 Columbus had com-pared the place near outfall of the Orinoco River with the paradise described in the “Gospel” in 1498 during his third travel and had noted that,mentioned place was the paradise.As you see,thoughts of two Italians are analo-gous again.1 Сlеzкin Л.Ö.Зеmlə Сvətого Кrесtа.Оtкrıtiе i zаvоеvаniе Бrаzilii.Москvа,«Наuка»,1970.сtr.32-33 2

too.The Florentine accountant wrote in his second letter:“Many families came to see us.They were surprised when saw our white skins and faces.When they asked where we came from,we said that,came from the sky and wanted to see the Earth and they believed in it”.1 Columbus wrote following phrases in 1492 after reaching Guanahani Island:“I saw three villages and people,who lived there.They prayed God for seeing us.They gave us water and food.Some of them sailed towards me when saw us approaching the coast and asked if we came from the sky.An old man got on our boat and other men and women shouted:“Come and see people,who came from the sky,bring food and water for them”.” 2 After Columbus reac-hed Cuba,Hindus thought that,the Spanish had come from the sky.Such situation reoccurred when Hernán Cortés reached Mexican coasts.After crimes of the Spanish conquistadors in the islands located in the 1 В.Сtеüеnко-сосtаvitеlğ.Бriгаntinа – 71.Москvа,«МоlоDаə гvаrDiə».1971.сtr.361 2

beginning of the 16th century.5.Vespucci even used tale style in his letters in order to cause interest and amazement in readers and he was sure that,it would be effective.The outward appearan-ces,faces,traditions and bodies of aborigines had to be impressive.Vespucci’s second letter was full of such inventions:We saw huge footprints when reached coast of the island.It could belong to huge people only… We looked at them with amazement as they were too high… They looked as huge as Francesco Degli Albizzi.They (men – R.D.)were higher than women.We pre-ferred to return to vessels as they looked dangerous.They had big bows,arrows and bludgeons.1 According to further researches,there weren’t huge people around the Caribbean Sea and Brazilian coasts.But the Spanish saw high Hindus in different places.It has been proved that,huge people of the South America are Hindus of Patagon.They are too high,strong,dread-ful,forbearing and resolute.But Vespucci couldn’t see 1

described them in his second letter.Of course,he used the diary of Columbus for this purpose.The Florentine accountant wrote in his second letter:“We understood that they were cannibals.They were too merciless and ate people”.1 He even added:“…Aborigines run to the hill.Women had already chopped a man (the Portugal seaman – R.D.)and cooked him on the bonfire.Men explained with allusions that,they had eaten two of us”… 2 As I mentioned above,the participant of the expedition of Columbus D.Chanca made notes in his diary on Cannibalism of Hindus.But if all of Hindus,who lived in ten thousands of islands,located in the Caribbean Sea,were cannibals,D.Chanca had to note it about all is-lands.Cannibals lived in several islands and their tradi-tions couldn’t affect other Hindus.It means that,there

places “found” by Vespucci.He only used mentioned letter for his lies.7.There is following note in the diary of Columbus:“…People with one eye and face like dogs live far from here.They ate human.They cut off heads and sex organs of their captives and drank their blood”.But Vespucci wrote in his second letter:“They (cannibals – R.D.)had cut off sex organs of two men in the boat and their wounds were new.We were surprised.When we took them to the vessel,they explained that people in canoe wanted to eat two Hindus,who were captivated,after cutting off their sex organs.We understood that,they were cannibals.They were too merciless and ate people”.1 These sentences prove that Vespucci had used diary of Columbus.8.According to some historians,Vespucci achieved fame in the world owing to his “third” travel.The astro-nomer had described aborigines,who lived on the coast,as merciless cannibals.He wrote following sentences in his letter about population of the new continent:“They had relations with all women.They hadn’t any kings,1 В.Сtеüеnко-сосtаvitеlğ.Бriгаntinа – 71.Москvа,«МоlоDаə гvаrDiə».1971.сtr.365   116 temples,money or trade relations.Aborigines fought against each other and hadn’t any rules.I see one of them,who boasted of eating 300 men.Then I stayed in the city for 27 days and saw salted human meats hung at homes.Hindus were surprised when learned that we didn’t eat our enemies.They said that human meat was very tasty and appetitive”.1 Columbus discovered Guadeloupe Islands on Novem-ber 4,1493 and stayed there for eight days.The Spanish,who reached the coast,often approached houses of abori-gines and looked at them.The doctor of the expedition Diego Álvarez Chanca described interesting moments in his letter:“We saw a lot of human skulls and bones hung as kitchen utensils.There were few men in that village.Women explained that,men went to the neighboring islands for robbery on canoes.People of that island were more developed than others… They had a lot of cotton and cotton coverlets.Those coverlets weren’t worse than coverlets of Castile”.2 1 АvаDəеvа Е.Н.,ЗDаnоviç Л.İ.Сtо vеliкiх mоrе-plаvаtеlеy.Москvа,«Веçе»,1999.сtr.79 2

islands.They attacked Aravaca Hindus,who hadn’t weapons and were very peaceful.Their weapons were bows and arrows,which were made of the turtle shells and fish bones.Besides,Chanca wrote:“Caribbean people took a lot of girls on their canoes when they attacked other islands.They used those girls as servants and wives.There were too many women.We saw only Hindu girls in 50 houses… Indigenous women said that,Caribbean people ate children of captivated women.They brought up only children of their women.They ate captivated men too.They did it with killed enemies as well”.1 Columbus and Chanca described Caribbean people as cannibals according to the information given by abori-gines,who lived in Hispaniola and girls,who were capti-vated in Small Anthill Islands.Such notes could be seen in Vespucci’s letters too.He also wrote that,Hindus,who lived in Brazilian coasts captivated and ate their enemies.But according to the historical sources and chronicler of the New World – Bartolomé de las Casas,the Spanish 1 İ.П.МагiDоviç,В.İ.МагiDоviç.Оçеrкi pо iсtоrii геогrафiçескiх оtкrıtiy,II tоm.Москvа,“Пrосvеhеniе”,1982.сtr.26-27   118 didn’t see cannibals in the islands of the Caribbean Sea.They even didn’t meet cannibals when investigated the fourth continent.It means that,mentioned sentences were only rumors.After reading both of letters of the Florentine account-tant,I came to the following conclusion:Vespucci used results and materials of Columbus gathered during the second expedition.So,I described some moments of the second travel of Columbus (1493-1496)in order to prove it.I think,additional explanation isn’t required.But there is another important issue.Vespucci had mentioned that,discovered lands were very picturesque and beautiful.9.I think,he even used writings of Pêro Vaz de Ca-minha,who described everything happened during disco-very of Brazil by Cabral in 1500,when he was in Portu-gal.He wrote in his report prepared for Don Manuel:“The coastline is smooth and beautiful.Forest seen from the sea isn’t smooth… We can’t find out if there are gold,silver,iron or other metals here.We can’t see them.But the weather is fresh and fine here… There is too much fresh water.The soil is very fertile,if it is cultivated,  119 everything can be grown there owing to the rich water resources”.1 Of course,some experts may say that,Vespucci wrote same things as he also saw same scenes in the New World.But whole second letter was prepared using diaries of the travelers,who traveled to the coasts of the New World.The letter of Pero Vaz de Caminha also was full of exaggerated facts.The facts on gold also resemble the report prepared by Columbus during his first travel.As if they tried to write tales in order to win king’s confidence.They knew that he is interested in gold,so wrote about gold a lot.For instance,notes of Caminha,made after reaching Brazilian coasts.Though the Florentine accountant kept names of the leaders of the third expedition secret,it has been proved that,the expedition was led by the celebrated Portugal sea traveler Gonçalo Coelho.But neither Coelho,nor other members of the expedition never gave any infor-mation about it.Vespucci deceived his companions,1 Сlеzкin Л.Ö.Зеmlə Сvətого Кrесtа.Оtкrıtiе i zаvоеvаniе Бrаzilii.Москvа,«Наuка»,1970.сtr.29-30   120 colleagues and even people,who trusted him,and friends with his writings.It isn’t difficult to understand his purpose.He tried to attract attention of the world and wanted everybody to think that,he was discoverer of the southern continent.I can write a lot about this compilation letter and add plenty of facts.I want to note again that,32-page letters,which traveled through whole Europe,are copies of other letters and diaries.Vespucci thought that,the diary of Columbus would never be published as it was a secret document,and so,everybody would think that,really,he was a discoverer of the southern continent.The Floren-tine accountant knew that,Columbus noted all significant events,happened during his first travel,in his diary and that document was given to the Spanish monarchs.It wasn’t returned to the admiral before he started his second travel and afterwards,Bartolomé de las Casas got it.  121 Vespucci realizes his scenario As it was mentioned above,the first letter was written to one of the influential persons of Florentine – Lorenzo di Pierfrancesco de' Medici at the end of 1502 or in March-April of 1503.He prepared the letter hastily in order to be one of the well-known travelers.Because,that mission hadn’t achieved any serious success.The fact that,the land discovered by Columbus was the fourth continent of the Earth,which wasn’t known in the Old World,gradually began to be spread.This was officially declared by Juan de la Cosa – participant of the first expedition of Columbus.It was a sensational discovery.Vespucci had to misappropriate the Genoese admiral’s success.Vespucci was lucky.When Columbus discovered outfall of the Orinoco during his third travel (1498-1500),he understood that,such rich river could belong to the continent only.If that territory wasn’t part of Asia,it could be unknown continent.But that success wasn’t good for monarchs and officials of Spain.They hadn’t planned such great discovery.So,intrigues against the   122 Genoese admiral began to be prepared after that news spread in Spain.Christopher Columbus (1451-1506)  123 At first,he had to be disgraced.The most suitable condition for it was rebellion of the Spanish Hidalgos and other missioners against the brothers of Columbus in Hispaniola (Haiti).The Spanish monarchs tried to use this suitable condition.Their representative Francisco de Bobadilla was sent to Hispaniola with special compe-tencies and he led interrogation without questioning brothers of Columbus.Besides,Nicolás de Ovando was appointed governor of the island.Columbus and his brothers were arrested and sent to Spain in handcuffs at the beginning of 1500.In 1499,after preconceived explanations of Francisco de Bobadilla sent to Spain,monopoly of Columbus on the New World was lost and new expeditions began to be sent towards the Caribbean Sea.Vespucci used this opportunity and prepared his second letter.He wrote that,he had participated at four travels in 1497-1504.He didn’t need any witness to prove it.Because that forged letter had to be published far from the Pyreness Peninsula.Why did Vespucci do it? He tried to misappropriate several successes with one letter.Columbus reached the southern continent of the New World in 1498.Vespucci wrote that,he reached mentioned coast first of all in 1497   124 and besides,investigated that territory.In addition,he wrote that as if he investigated a large territory (between Honduras and southeastern coasts of Mexico),which was considered bridge between two continents,located in the west of the Central America.It means that,he wanted to show that discovery as his success.Though according to the historical sources,that territory was discovered by Columbus in 1503-1504 and large report was sent to the Spanish monarchs about it.Columbus’s expedition passes the Atlantic Ocean   125 If Vespucci was right,we could say that,mentioned lands were discovered by him.But the Florentine accountant unmasked himself as he didn’t consider actual processes,prohibitions on travelers and their political positions.How could Vespucci or other Spanish traveler sail to the western part of the Atlantic Ocean in 1497 when monopoly on the coasts of the New World belonged to Columbus before 1499? It means that,Vespucci lied.The second lie of the second letter was on the investigation of coasts of Honduras and Mexico.He only tried to misappropriate successes of Columbus.Could Vespucci do it on somebody’s request? Of course,the rebellion of the Spanish Hidalgos against brothers of Columbus organized in 1498 wasn’t good for the admiral and his opponents tried to use this opportunity effectively.But there was an agreement between Christopher Columbus and Spanish monarchs and everybody had to consider it.That’s why Columbus had to be disgraced and deprived of his fame.Vespucci appeared in that stage.The governor of Hispaniola ordered Nicolás de Ovando not to allow the admiral to enter the island in 1502,when Columbus started his fourth travel.It means that,Columbus was persona non grata for the Spanish   126 authority.Though the capital of the island Santo Domingo was founded by the admiral in 1494 (Santo Domingo was considered the first city of the New World by Europeans).Even nobody helped Columbus when he met an accident in Jamaica and Ovando said that he had to die in front of the sea.Of course,the governor sent information on the miserable fate of the Genoese traveler,who was discoverer of the New World,to his supporters in Madrid.Vespucci’s forged letters began to spread during that period.His purpose was to declare himself discoverer of the New World.I explained it above in detail.Vespucci mentioned that,he was invited to the expedition by the king Ferdinand during the first travel.He didn’t write anything about his position during the second travel and wrote that he was an assistant of captains during other two travels.But nobody confirmed these appointments.He wrote almost nothing about geographical coordinates (especially latitudes)and navi-gation calculations.But Vespucci described starry sky of the southern hemisphere,nature of discovered countries,outward appearances,characters,culture and traditions of Hindus with special enthusiasm.Of course,he had stolen all these information.  127 There was great interest for discovered countries and lands in Europe in those years.Reports of the travelers and navigators were rarely published.That’s why Ves-pucci’s letters on his “travels” caused great interest in most countries of Europe.Some experts came to the conclusion that,most sentences were added to the letters by other people,especially publishers and Vespucci didn’t know anything about it.The purpose was to cause interest.That’s why,Vespucci’s letters were translated into different langua-ges and published for twenty three times during a short time.There is a fact of such interference.Holland publisher published report of Vespucci’s fifth travel a year later – in 1508.He used notes of Balthasar Sprenger for preparation of that forged report and that manuscript was spread widely.The publisher only replaced the phrase “Ego,Balthasar Sprenger” (I,Balthasar Sprenger in Latin)of the original manuscript with the phrase “İck,Alberigus” (I,Alberigus in Latin)in order to make readers believe that,it was really Vespucci’s travel.Such forgery could mislead even the chairman of the London Geographic Society 400 years later.In 1892,he grandi-  128 loquently declared that,Vespucci’s fifth travel was found out.1 Defenders of the Florentine accountant mentioned that,he wasn’t aware of such frauds.But I have some doubts on this issue.It doesn’t convincing that Vespucci knew nothing about such tumultuous publicization.Because he was head navigator of Castile and there were a lot of secret employees of his organization in big cities of Europe.How could they forget to inform the head navi-gator? Were they busy with doing Vespucci’s other bidding in Europe? May be,they tried to spread forged documents on the discovery of the fourth continent? Many objective specialists wrote about Vespucci’s inactivity.S.Sveyg wrote:“Why didn’t Vespucci deny books published under his name though he died in 1512? Could he knew nothing about that fake propaganda? Wasn’t he able to declare that wasn’t discoverer of America?” 2 1 С.Üvеyг.Соbrаniе соçinеniy v сеmi tоmах.ЗvеzDnıе çасı çеlоvеçесtvа.III tоm.Москvа,«ПrаvDа»,1963.сtr.438-439 2 С.Üvеyг.Соbrаniе соçinеniy v сеmi tоmах.ЗvеzDnıе çасı çеlоvеçесtvа.III tоm.Москvа,«ПrаvDа»,1963.сtr.439   129 All these facts prove that,Vespucci deceived the world community owing to mentioned letters.Why didn’t most scientists unmask Vespucci’s lie? Perhaps,nobody couldn’t dare to do it or didn’t pay attention to this problem.Because Vespucci was appoint-ted head navigator of Castile two years after death of the Genoese traveler and made most scientists,especially geographers of Spain to depend on him using his authority.So,those persons began to gather materials for the head navigator.After a while,those persons began to declare that Vespucci was discoverer of the coasts of the New World.Only a group of people knew that it was a lie.But most of them had a significant role in making it to look like truth.If they tried to unmask Vespucci,they would also be unmasked.Nobody could dare to do it.It could end their carrier completely.So those persons were obliged to support Vespucci even after his death.Vespucci had planned it beforehand.But in spite of it,Waldsemuller named discovered land “Unknown land” instead of “America” when he published map of the coasts of the New World in 1517.Though that map was considered copy of the map,which was made in 1507 and was   130 demonstrated in Sen-Dye.Did the scientist become more honest or had it another reason? There is no doubt that,Waldsemuller tried to restore the truth.Because naming Vespucci well-known traveler though he hadn’t role in discovery of the New World was deceiving the world community.There were pressures on the family of Columbus in order to steal the fame of the well-known Genoese traveler.Intrigues against Christopher Columbus Scientists wanted to note that Columbus wasn’t the first traveler,who reached coasts of the New World.They mentioned that,some Europeans sailed there before him and the Genoese seaman knew it already.It was said in order to hide success achieved by Columbus.Because his discovery didn’t please leaders of Spain.  131 Columbus was very ambitious person and required great privileges of the Spanish monarchs before starting his first transatlantic travel and that’s why aroused hatred in many persons.Why didn’t he suppose that those privileges could harm him? This step can be charac-terized as a prescience or risk.Perhaps,he wanted to be only leader of discovered lands.But Columbus earned a lot of enemies owing to this step.After discovery of the fourth continent for Spain and whole Old World,Columbus required his privileges and he was sure that would be able to get them.Of course,the Spanish monarchs Isabella of Castile and Ferdinand of Aragon had to keep their promises.But as the privileges were so great,this step could make Columbus third or fourth person of the kingdom.It wasn’t convin-cing that,the Spanish officials would allow progress of the Italian traveler.So,Columbus had to be disgraced and there were too many methods for it.Those actions were started after the admiral’s third travel and culmination occurred after he died.Of course,heirs of the admiral struggled against the Spanish monarchs in order to defend their legal rights.I want to note several moments of the campaign against the admiral.  132 Bartolomé de las Casas (1484-1566)  133 Half of Florida,Anthill islands,Mexico and South America became property of Portugal after the treaty of Alcáçovas was signed between Portugal and Spain in 1481.After “Aeterni Regis” came into force,historians began to write that,America was discovered by the Portugal travelers before 1481 and they kept this fact secret for a long time.This idea was supported by all chroniclers of the 16th century – Bartolomé de las Casas,Francisco López de Gómara and Gonzalo Fernández de Oviedo y Valdés.The Peruvian chronicler Garcilaso de la Vega (son of the Hidalgo from Extremadura and Ink prince)even noted that,discoverer of America was Alonso Sánchez de Huelva.Besides,George Blon,Francisco López de Gómara Alonso and others wrote that,Huelva had met with Columbus.I have to list following facts in order to prove it:Alonso Sánchez de Huelva,who was from Niebla,carried different goods from Spain to Canaries in 1484 with his small vessel.He took fruits from Canaries to Madeira and went to Spain with jams.He was met by hurricane on his way between Canaries and Madeira.He sailed for 28 or 29 days under the hurricane and approached unknown island by accident.Perhaps,it was   134 Santo Domingo as it is located on the route of the hurricane (east wind).1 Gonzalo Fernández de Oviedo y Valdés (1478-1557)1 Qоrсilасо Dе lа Вега.Тексt vосprоizvеDеn pо

raved about songs of motley birds,unknown animals and colored people.The vessel had been sailing from the west and struck the coast.Christopher Columbus took half-dead navigator home.He looked after his guest and it became clear that,navigator’s name was Alonso Sanchez de Huelva.After getting better,Alonso Sanchez explained everything that happened to them.It became clear that,they had lost their way in the dark sea (then Atlantic Ocean was called like that – R.D.)and reached very charming island.Sanchez informed his liberator about the place where the island was situated.1 After it he died as other survived seamen of the wrecked vessel.2 According to the Peruvian chronicler Garcilaso de la Vega,historian Francisco Lopez de Gomara had written about the adventure of Alonso Sanchez de Huelva in his work “General history of India”.Son of the Ink prince caviled at that work as following:“De Gomara heard this 1 Cоrc Бlоn,«Аtlаntiçескiy океаn»,сtr.15.2 frаnüiско-Dе-Qоmаrа.«Оbhаə iсtоriə

the palace”.Alonso Sánchez de Huelva   137 This adventure was told by the bishop Joseph Acosta for the first time.When he was in Peru,he heard that,one seaman had discovered coasts of the New World at the result of heavy hurricane and showed the way to Christopher Columbus as the Genoese seaman helped him after the catastrophe happened on the way to Madeira.Columbus told this story to some acquaintances including courtiers,and they helped him in organization of the expedition.1 Conquistadors noted that,America had been disco-vered by Alonso Sanchez (de Huelva – R.D.).It was said because there was an inheritance conflict between heirs of Columbus and leadership of Castilia at that time (1510-1550).That’s why courtiers tried to prove that,lands located on the other side of the ocean hadn’t been discovered by Columbus.2 Historians,who were against Columbus,noted that,II Juan wanted to entrust Sanchez with discovering those lands as he was in the west after surviving in the catastrophe.Columbus rendered the navigator harmless 1 Qоrсilасо Dе lа Вега.Тексt vосprоizvеDеn pо izDаniö,İсtоriə госuDаrсtvа İnкоv.Л.«Наuка».1974.сtr.17-18.2 Сvеt Ə.М.Пutеşесtviе Хriсtофоrа

(1539-1616)  139 As I mentioned above,the Spanish monarchs had to keep promises if Columbus could discover coasts of the New World.People,who were close to the palace,were obliged to make up such events in order to disgrace the Genoese traveler,who was appointed admiral after the first travel.They even enlisted scientists and researchers for this job.But it is interesting that,this idea was supported by some scientists even after the struggle for inheritance ended.This thought is so preconceived because when seamen of the wrecked vessel approached the coast,there were a lot of people besides Columbus and explanations were made with participation of them.The Peruvian chronicler Garcilaso de la Vega,Francisco Lopez de Gomara and George Blon didn’t want to deny services of Columbus when mentioned name of Huelva and noted that he had met the famous traveler.They only wanted to emphasize that,the Genoese seaman had got necessary information for realization of his transatlantic travel from Huelva.But as Columbus was very experienced navigator,he couldn’t believe in such unserious,inexact information.He was sure that,America was far from Madeira Islands and it was impossible to reach there without knowing   140 coordinates.Alonso de Huelva might meet with any island – even with Green Cape Islands.Francisco Lopez de Gomara (1511-1566)  141 This strange idea can’t cast a shadow on the authority of Columbus.It was written in Garcilaso de la Vega’s book that,Alonso Sanchez sailed in an unknown direction for 28-29 days under the influence of the hurricane and approached Santo Domingo Island.How it was possible? It means that,the vessel,which was pushed towards the west,met with Gulfstream current and could run away from it easily.It isn’t convincing as in that case the Portuguese could discover unknown lands located in the west of the Atlantic Ocean before the first travel of Columbus.The Portuguese had sent there expeditions under the leadership of Vogado,Telles and Van Olmen,but none of those expeditions resulted in success.  142 Ambitions of Columbus and Vespucci’s ruse As it was mentioned above,coasts of the New World was named “America” after death of Columbus.Otherwise,the admiral could defend his rights.Vespucci used his rival’s death for realization of his plans.The Florentine accountant knew that,Columbus wouldn’t allow to name the continent he discovered,America if he was alive.Of course,rights of Columbus could be defended by the admiral’s friends and colleagues too.But they participated in investigation of the New World within some expeditions and hadn’t opportunity for returning to Spain during that period.In spite of it,scientists and seamen,who were in Spain,mentioned that,Vespucci was a conjurer,crafty person,profiteer and venturesome person.Because he tried to steal the success achieved by Columbus.As it was noted in the historical sources,Columbus always praised the Florentine accountant,but he didn’t justify admiral’s confidence.It seems that,Vespucci established relation with Columbus in order to learn secrets of the discovery of the coasts of the New World.  143 Some specialists may ask,how could Columbus declare himself discoverer of the New World,if he didn’t know that discovered unknown lands when reached Guanahani Island of Bahamas? According to the most historical sources,the Genoese admiral thought that he had reached part of Asia during all of his travels.It could be understandable if Columbus sailed to the coasts of America once.But the admiral traveled there for four times and couldn’t understand that he had reached the fourth continent.I want to disprove it.The Genoese admiral found o lot of fresh water when entered the Gulf of Paria during his third travel (1498-1500)and thought that,it can be brought by long and rich river as in continents.Such river couldn’t be in the island.It means that,Columbus was sure that he had approached the huge territory.He made following notes in his diary prepared during the travel:“Is this a continent! Another world?” He was almost sure that reached huge continent.Conception of scepticism “questionable – R.D.” was founded nearly in the middle of the 16th century.According to this conception,Columbus had certain information on existence of lands,which located in the west of the Atlantic Ocean and didn’t belong to Asia,  144 when he started his travel on August 3,1492.Supporters of this conception were A.Vinio from America,Romulo D.Carbia from Argentine,M.André from France and R.Beliester Escalas from Spain in the 20th century.1 Columbus began to lose his fame after Vasco da Gama discovered seaway to India in 1498.Even he began to be called a conjurer and babbler.The Spanish Hidalgos in Hispaniola didn’t obey admiral and his employees.There was a rebellion against him in the island and a lot of Hidalgos were killed at the result of the armed conflict.The island almost became graveyard of the Spanish Hidalgos.Travelers,who returned to Spain early,informed monarchs about chaos,occurred in the coasts of the New World,and arbitrariness of Columbus by misrepresenting facts.It seems that,this process was the first stage of the plan on disgracing the admiral.The Spanish monarchs cancelled monopoly of Columbus on the coasts of the New World when he was suppressing rebellion in the lands,he discovered.The Spanish officials cancelled the contract signed with the 1

navigators,who once were colleagues of Columbus,used this opportunity and began to organize expeditions towards the other side of the Atlantic Ocean as his rivals.That decision resulted in losses for the creditors of Columbus too.Mostly his compatriots financed his travels.It is known that,the first travel of Columbus (1492-1493)was financed by Luis de Santángel – financial adviser and treasurer of the kingdom,who was close to the king Ferdinand,and Francesco Pinelli,who was known in Spain as Pinelo.Pinelli was Luis de Santángel’s colleague.Both of them managed treasury of the “Holy” Hermandad,who was considered police of Spain (he conducted law enfor-cement functions in the city and village communities of Spain).The academician Charles Verlin wrote in his book “Conquerors of America”:“They agreed to allocate 1400000 maravedis for the travel of America.Other persons from Genoa,who were informed by Pinelli,allocated 150000 maravedis for Columbus.As Columbus needed 2000000 maravedis for his travel,he had to found 350000 maravedis in addition.That amount was given to   146 the admiral by Santángel from the treasury of Aragon.The rich financers would get great profit at the result of the expedition according to the agreement between Columbus and them.Pinelli,who earned a lot of money after the expeditions,became one of the founders of the Chamber of Issues on India (Casa de la Contratacion de las İndias)in 1503”.1 The second expedition of the admiral was financed by the owner of the trading house in Spain – Capetto (Juanoto or Cuanoto)Berardi,but he couldn’t get a profit as died in 1495.Vespucci,who worked at the trading house after Berardi’s death,paid salaries of seamen with 10000 maravedis,he borrowed from the treasurer Francesco Pinelli in 1496.Amerigo Vespucci partly financed the third travel of Christopher Columbus (1498-1500)afterwards.In a word,financers aimed to get great profits from discovered lands.They also would lose monopoly on discovered lands.The officials,who knew the admiral very well,Colum-bus was forbearing,courageous,fearless,ambitious and 1 Ч.ВеrlinDеn.Покоritеli Аmеriкi.Росtоv-nа-Доnu,«fеniкс»,1997.сtr.38   147 strong-willed person.As it wasn’t easy to learn his secrets,they decided to crush him morally.That’s why,he had to disgrace in Spain and even in the land he discovered.Francisco de Bobadilla,who went to Hispaniola according to the special task in 1500,deprived Columbus of all authorities,arrested him together with his brothers Bartolomeu and Diego and sent them to Spain in handcuffs.It was a great grief for the arrogant person and of course,he had to look for somebody to share his grief.So,Amerigo Vespucci became the admiral’s interlocutor.There is no doubt that,Columbus had a lot of secrets on the discovery of the New World.Even the closest colleagues of the admiral didn’t know those secrets.Too many people,especially officials,who were interested in the geographical discoveries,tried to learn those secrets.A dishonest person was needed for wining admiral’s confidence and learning his secrets.It was expedient to look for such person among the compatriots of Christo-pher Columbus.Because he would trust them more easily.It seems that,Amerigo Vespucci complained about Spanish monarchs,mentioned that,Italians hadn’t any perspective in Spain and he would move to Portugal.  148 But Italians weren’t respected in Portugal.Though he had discovered large coastline within the expedition of Alonso de Ojeda,monarchs didn’t award him.The death of Columbus.Lithograph by L.Prang & Co.,1893 The admiral heard of Vespucci’s decision,he had prepared to realize his desire to move to Portugal.Columbus shared information about lands he discovered   149 around the Caribbean Sea with his compatriot and showed Juan de la Cosa’s maps and Diego Chanca’s diary in 1500.Though it is only my assumption,it sounds so convincing.Vespucci learned a lot about the territories around the Caribbean Sea after Columbus shared corresponding information with him.Probably,the Florentine accountant approached his compatriot,who was in the desperate situation,as the spy of the authority.But Columbus didn’t share everything he knew with Vespucci.The Florentine accountant expected more suitable moment for it.Thus,Vespucci complained about indifference in Castile and said to his “friend” that planned to move to Portugal.So,Columbus began to trust him.The admiral thought that their destines were alike as both of them had exposed to the indifference.Afterwards Vespucci went to Portugal and tried to enter one of the expeditions,which would sail towards the southern continent.As it is known,he was member of the expeditions,which investigated Brazilian coasts in 1500-1501 and 1502-1503,and was able to misappro-priate other persons’ successes.It should be noted that,Amerigo Vespucci could participate in mentioned two expeditions owing to the information he got from   150 Christopher Columbus.He informed the Portuguese about lands,which had been discovered by Columbus around the Caribbean Sea.That’s why the Portuguese travelers refused to investi-gate lands,located above the northern coasts of Brazil.Vespucci’s manipulation skill Everybody thought that Columbus lost all hopes.But Isabella of Castile allowed him to organize his next expedition as the proof of her respect to the admiral.That step of the queen enraged some persons and they used another plan in order to disgrace the foreign admiral.As it is known,Columbus couldn’t discover seaway to India during his fourth travel (1502-1504)and it roused the indignation of monarchs.Though he had discovered 2000 km coastline located on the western coast of the Caribbean See and spread important information about it during that travel.  151 Vespucci,who completed his mission in Portugal,returned to Spain as the “influential traveler” and restored his relation with Columbus,who had lost all authorities,according to the next instructions of his supporters.The Genoese admiral had almost nothing at the end of 1504.But he hadn’t lost his persistence and obstinacy.He tried to make monarchs to pay salaries of his colleagues,who had suffered with him in Jamaica.But he almost lost all his hopes after the death of Isabella of Castile (November 26,1504).Columbus needed his compatriots,as he was seeking consolation.Vespucci became more active during that period.There was a strange tandem between Columbus and Vespucci.Columbus was supported by Isabella of Castile when Vespucci’s supporter was Ferdinand of Aragon.The supporter of Columbus died,but Vespucci began to be popular owing to his supporter.Though it wasn’t easy to remove Columbus from the public arena completely.He had contract with the Spanish monarch and Ferdinand of Aragon couldn’t deny it.That’s why he supported Ves-pucci in order to crush Columbus morally.Vespucci met with Columbus on February 3,1505 and the conversation between them was very interesting.  152 Perhaps,discovery of the New World and other enig-matic issues were discussed during that conversation.It becomes obvious after reading Columbus letters.Amerigo Vespucci’s defenders mention that,he never betrayed Columbus and they were close friends.The Florentine accountant was able to win confidence of Columbus and Columbus wrote following sentences in his letter,written to his son Diego on February 5,1505:“I talked to Amerigo Vespucci,who was invited to the palace in order to discuss some issues on travels,two days ago.He will deliver this letter to you.He is very honest man and agreed to help me whenever I want.He also isn’t very lucky as many of us.His job hasn’t been appraised as necessary.He will go to the palace and try to achieve some good decisions for me.I don’t know what he can do for me exactly as I’m here… But I know that he will do his best in order to help me… Think about it:what can he do for us? He will do his best with the greatest pleasure,but try not to let him to know details.I informed him about my works,including exclusive ones and share I could get for conducted works.Please,show   153 this letter to the adelantado (Bartolomeu).Maybe,he can decide how Vespucci can help me”.1 Everybody considered Vespucci honest man accor-ding to this letter.The letter proves that Columbus trusted the Florentine accountant.He even wrote that Vespucci would go to the palace and had close relations with the Spanish monarchs.Columbus needed to meet with Ferdinand of Aragon very much.He was sure that Amerigo Vespucci was an honest man.It proves that,the accountant had won admiral’s confidence.Besides,Vespucci made Columbus to believe that he would ask the king to receive him.How could Columbus believe such non-sense? How could Vespucci ask the king to receive Columbus though the king hated admiral? It proves that Columbus was in the desperate situation as believed that lie,because he knew that,people had to wait for months,even for years for meeting with the king.Columbus shared all his secrets with Vespucci as believed that he would help him.It was culmination of their conversation.Vespucci could get all information he 1 Лiеlас А.Каrаvеllı vıхоDət v океаn.Пеr.с lаtış.Рiга,«Лiесmа»,1969.сtr.250   154 needed.This information included information on prepa-ration of the first transatlantic map,the fact that the fourth continent wasn’t part of Asia,but unknown land,the reason,why he kept this fact secret,secret map of discovered land and etc.At the result of it,Vespucci described discovered land,as the New World though didn’t know anything about major geographical disco-veries,unexpectedly Martin Waldsemuller demonstrated map of the fourth continent in Sen-Dye,the Florentine accountant made up fake travels and introduced himself as the well-known admiral among the elite.The Genoese seaman thought that,Vespucci would support him on all issues,especially for the struggle for his rights.He couldn’t even imagine that,Vespucci would deny all his successes after his death and spread forged materials and letters full of nonsenses in order to name the New World “America”.Probably,Columbus shared all his secrets on the coasts of the New World with Vespucci as believed that he was honest.Why did the Genoese admiral trust the Florentine accountant? Because Vespucci had helped him before.The last conversation between Columbus and Ves-pucci brought only trouble to the admiral.Because all his   155 secrets were socialized by another person.However,in spite of it,he persisted in restoration of his rights and regularly sent letters to the king for this purpose.Of course,his letters weren’t responded because Columbus required too great privileges.The king didn’t even want to discuss this issue.One of the enigmas was as following.Could Colum-bus really reach Malacca Peninsula of the Southeastern Asia during his fourth travel as he wrote to Isabella of Castile? The king had doubts about it.Maybe,the admiral really discovered the strait on the way to Asia and investigated coasts of Malacca Peninsula.Columbus had some supporters at the palace and he could meet with the king owing to those persons.The king wanted to end his doubts.Ferdinand met the old traveler politely in May of 1505,but didn’t promised him anything.However,Columbus obstinately required realization of all articles of the contract.The king mentioned that independent law-court had to analyze this issue.Nevertheless,Colum-bus didn’t agree with the king and noted that,he didn’t need proofs for restoration of his rights.He rejected real property in Spain and life pension,offered by the king instead of his privileges.  156 The king ordered special council to solve that problem,but the council didn’t harry to make a certain decision… After Columbus was sure that,his rights would never be restored,he asked Ferdinand to declare his son Diego heirs of his rights… Ferdinand rejected this request too.1 Columbus shared his secret with Vespucci As it was mentioned above,part of the capital,which was needed for the third travel of Columbus (1498-1500)was found by the Florentine accountant.Besides,he financed travels of the other Spanish expedition towards another side of the Atlantic Ocean.Perhaps,it was Alonso Ojeda’s expedition and Vespucci participated at that travel as the financer.1 Лiеlас А.Каrаvеllı vıхоDət v океаn.Пеr.с lаtış.Рiга,«Лiесmа»,1969.сtr.251   157 Probably,“Lost map of Columbus”,which was consi-dered greatest secret of the admiral,was also shown to Vespucci by him.Columbus could discover coasts of the New World at the result of the first expedition towards another side of the Atlantic Ocean owing to that map.Columbus planned to broaden his activity by resear-ching the continent he discovered,during every travel.Perhaps,he would discover new territories if could get opportunity to organize fifth travel to the coasts of the New World.Nevertheless,he and his children had rights on discovered lands.There was following note in the contract signed with the traveler:Columbus hadn’t right of debate with Ferdinand of Aragon or Isabella of Castile for rights on mentioned lands as long as he lived.Because he had deceived the Spanish monarchs.It has been proved that,children of Columbus began to try to defend their rights after the death of the admiral.There were great court sessions on this issue in Spain.A lot of facts began to be cleared up according to these explanations.It turns out that Columbus tried to deceive the world community,besides the Spanish monarchs.These facts helped his opponents to disgrace Columbus.I came to the following conclusion after analyzing documents on the activity of Columbus:He deceived the   158 Spanish monarchs when signed the contract.Ferdinand of Aragon and Isabella of Castile couldn’t understand ruse of the professional traveler.The Spanish monarchs thought that they deceived him when signed the contract and gave Columbus privileges he wanted.According to the conditions of the contract,Columbus would have rights on discovered lands and those rights would pass down from generation to generation.He would be admiral and vice-king of discovered lands after the discovery.According to the history,Columbus went ashore together with the captain of the vessel “Pinta” Martin Alonso Pinson,captain of “Ninia” Vicente Janez Pinson,notary and inspector as soon as Guanahini was disco-vered and titles of Columbus were declared after the flag of Castile was sticked into the ground there.As it is known,Ferdinand of Aragon and Isabella of Castile kept their promises,but they knew that Columbus wouldn’t get any rights on discovered lands actually,because the admiral had to reach Asia according to the project.Columbus might reach Japan,Chine or India in the East Asia and they were powerful independent countries of Asia.He wouldn’t be able to require rights on the   159 territories of independent countries.The Spanish monarchs knew it very well and thought that they could Spanish monarch Ferdinand of Aragon (1452-1516)  160 deceive Columbus.Ferdinand of Aragon,who was considered prescient politician and skilful commander,gave Colum-bus fantastic privileges and wanted him to discover western way to Asia,which was very important for Spain,at his wife’s urgent request.However,monarchs couldn’t even imagine that,there was an unknown continent in the western hemisphere between Europe and Asia.They had reports of geographers,cartographers,astronomers,cosmographers and mathe-maticians,who worked for the University of Salamanca and other educational establishments,about linear measures of the Earth.Actually,the king of Spain Ferdinand of Aragon was considered the most prescient politician of his time.He conducted all jobs cautiously and never made hasty steps.He tried not to make hasty steps about the contract signed with Columbus as well.But the traveler achieved his goal as Isabella of Castile approved his adherence to prin-ciples,resoluteness and optimism.The queen appraised skills and experience of Columbus and believed that he would achieve success.Ferdinand of Aragon accepted the traveler’s conditions owing to the queen.But Colum-bus was deprived of his rights after his real purpose was found out.  161 Spanish monarch Isabella of Castile (1451-1504)The great mistake of the Spanish monarchs was made by accident.Contract was signed between them and Columbus in 1492.Nobody knew in 1492 that,there was   162 a huge land area on the Atlantic Ocean,between Europe and Asia.That’s why the king was deceived when he wanted to deceive the traveler.Afterwards Ferdinand noted that he believed that,the Earth was spherical,but couldn’t imagine that it was larger than known.Because the king based on the reports of the Florentine scientist Paolo Toscanelli as he was considered the most talanted scientist.All leading scientists believed that the Earth was spherical when the map (the map,made by the scientist in 1474)appeared in Europe.They thought that there was only Asia on the other side of the Atlantic Ocean.You may ask that,how I came to this conclusion.Because all leading scientists of Europe imagined the Earth so.The Greek scientist Eratosthenes noted in the 3rd century that,if the Atlantic Ocean wasn’t huge,it would be possible to sail to India from the Iberian Peninsula through the same parallel.Toscanelli and everybody thought so.Only Columbus knew that,there was unknown huge land on the other side of the Atlantic Ocean.But he described Asia on the other side of the Atlantic Ocean on his map.It may be asked that,why researchers and travelers didn’t use the material proving existence of the fourth   163 continent if Columbus had it.I can mention some of them including Alonso Pinzón.I have a basis for it.It is known that,Martin Alonso Pinzón conducted all tasks of the expedition leader till October 6 during the first travel of Columbus.But he began to display stub-bornness after mentioned date.Perhaps,at first Pinzón was pleased because the expedition sailed through the west and he knew that route.Though Columbus kept real route of the travel secret,Pinzón almost knew real coordinates.The land wasn’t seen though they had overcome about 4200 km according to his calculations.Martin Alonso also had made a diary on the travel as Columbus do.He knew that,they had overcome 4200 km according to his notes.According to the historical sources,Martin Alonso started negotiations with the Genoese seaman on October 6 and required him to change direction towards the southwest.It was because Brazilian coasts were situated there.An interesting event occurred in 1515:Heir of Columbus Diego Colón brought an action against the Spanish authority for his rights on the New World.Juan de Fonseca (he managed new lands discovered on the coasts of the New World),who was close to the king of   164 Spain,prepared interrogation materials consisted of 24 paragraphs.It was noted on one of the paragraphs that,Columbus didn’t play any role in discovery of new lands.This job was conducted by Pedro Ruiz and he looked for witnesses in the cities of Andalusia.Main function of Pedro Ruis included:he made witnesses to acknowledge that,another side of the Atlantic Ocean was discovered by the seamen of Castile before Columbus and the Genoese seaman registrated his discovery with their support.The necessary answer was given by the son of Martin Alonso Pinzón – Arias Pérez.Pérez mentioned that,he was in Rome with his father in 1491 and found a material on unknown lands,which was prepared by the cosmo-grapher and was kept in the library belonging to Pope.He said that his father sent that material to the admiral and Columbus changed direction of the expedition towards the southwest after receiving it.Arias Pérez tried to convince people that,the expedition was managed by Alonso Pinzón according to the route described on the material found in the library of Pope,but not by Columbus.I think Martin Alonso also had the map of the fourth continent as Columbus.It means that,there were several   165 copies of such maps in the libraries of most cities located in the Apennine Peninsula,especially in Vatican or Rome.Thus,Columbus changed direction of the expedition towards the southwest on October 7,but he didn’t do it on the request of Martin Alonso.He did it owing to the birds flying towards that direction as he noted in his diary.Nevertheless,seamen rise in rebel on the request of Martin Alonso as they were dissatisfied of the long travel and required to return to Spain.Columbus asked them to wait for three days and discovered new continent on October 12.This fact was noted by the participant of the first travel of Juan Nino – Francesco Morales.He unmasked insidious purpose of Martin Alonso.1 There is no doubt that,opponents of Columbus will not agree with me.They may ask if Columbus was the most intelligent and well-informed person of his time.There isn’t much information proving it in the historical sources.Most people didn’t believe when I mentioned that,Columbus learned a lot about activity of the Greek scientist Eratosthenes.1 R.Dәniz.Xristofor Kolumb,Nәsirәddin Tusi vә Amerika qitәsinin hәqiqi kәşfi.Bakı,2014.Sәh.272-273   166 The territories located around the Caribbean Sea Columbus read too many books when he was in Italy,Portugal and Spain.He read books of Strabo,Plutarch,Pliny the Elder,Aristotle,Sophocles,Tusi,Ibn Sina,Biruni and other scientists.Columbus went to the coasts of the New World basing on the measures determined by   167 Eratosthenes and the structure of the Earth determined by Muhammad Nasiraddin Tusi.He learned a lot after reading mentioned books,but kept everything he learnt secret.But Vespucci was an exception as he had won admiral’s confidence.The Florentine accountant could learn secrets of Columbus,who had exact information about existence of lands on the other side of the Atlantic Ocean.Besides,Vespucci could get some reports made during different travels.It was really possible as Vespucci was a financer of the third expedition of Columbus in 1498 and was considered his nonofficial companion.It was written in the book “Hundred genius sea travelers”:“Perhaps,the Genoese traveler didn’t know that,his friend Vespucci was an active participant of the Spanish expeditions towards West India as the authori-tative representative of Berardi’s trading house in 1495 against the contract signed between Columbus and Spanish authority.Maybe,Columbus knew it and thought that,the reason of his failures wasn’t financial operations of Berardi,but his influential enemies and policy of catholic kings.As Vespucci had allocated a lot   168 of money for the expedition of Columbus,the trade house of Italy had to expect his success”.1 Important maps,which existed in the world before 1507 I came to the following conclusion at the result of recent researches:Columbus had a map of the huge land area,located in the western part of the Atlantic Ocean,even before his first transatlantic travel.He prepared the project,which he presented to the Spanish monarchs,using that map.Probably,lower part of the southern continent on Martin Waldsemuller’s map might be copied from the “Lost map of Columbus”.How could German scientists get mentioned important material? Existence of that sensational map was interes-1 АvаDəеvа Е.Н.,ЗDаnоviç Л.İ.Сtо vеliкiх mоrе-plаvаtеlеy.Москvа,«Веçе»,1999 г.сtr.75.  169 ting for whole world.I spent a lot of time for investi-gation of this issue.I described following facts in my book “The scientist passed ahead of centuries – Nasiraddin Tusi” 15 years ago according to the researches of the American profes-sor Charles Hapgood:western part of the map,made by the Turkish admiral Piri Reis (1513)and found at the Topkapi Palace Museum in 1929,was drawn using the map of Columbus.Before Ferdinand Magellan disco-vered the strait between the continent and Tierra del Fuego,Diego Solis reached La Plata Gulf and sailed to the Pacific Ocean,Faddey Bellinshauzen and Mikhail Lazarev discovered Antarctica,mentioned lands were described on the map of the Turkish admiral.It is interes-ting that,there were some similarities in descrip-tions of the South America by Waldsemuller and Piri Reis.The German scientist made that map 6 years before the Turkish admiral.My suppositions are:1.Piri Reis acknowledged that,he had copied the western part from the map of Columbus.It means that,mentioned map existed when Columbus presented his transatlantic poject to the “Mathematical Union” of Lisbon (1484).How could Columbus get it? It is known   170 that,the author of that unknown map wasn’t the Genoese admiral.Piri Reis’s map (1513)  171 2.According to some researchers,Columbus learned geography,astronomy,cartography and oceanography owing to Paolo dal Pozzo Toscanelli (1397-1484),who was one the most celebrated scientists of the 16th century,and he applied his knowledge in practice.Most scientists think that,he used the map made by Toscanelli in 1474 when started his travel.But I think that,it isn’t true as Columbus might give up the travel if he considered that,the distance between Europe and Asia was 10000 km to Cipango (Japan)and 12000 km to Chine.It means that,the Genoese seaman get that source differently.3.After Columbus became close to the Spanish authority in order share his problems,he showed his secret map to the Florentine accountant.Afterwards Vespucci drew everything he remembered on the map.He sent the map he made to Waldsemuller and indirectly made him to name the fourth continent in his honour.I think Columbus sent the map to Italy,Genoa or the public library of Florence by means of the most reliable herald after returned from the travel.But the map wasn’t delivered.Piri Reis controlled great part of the Atlantic Ocean during that period and he attacked vessels of Spain,Portugal,Genoa,Venice and Vatican in order to rob them.So,mentioned map also was taken by Turks on   172 the way to Italy.Thus,it couldn’t be delivered to the address.The southern part of the map made by Martin Waldsemuller   173 The world map made by Paolo Toscanelli in 1474 (reconstruction)  174 According to the historical sources,nobody except Columbus and Piri Reis had a map proving existence of the fourth continent (before its discovery).Simply,scientists believed that there were islands of Anthilia,Brazil,Saint Brandan and “Seven Cities” in the western part of the Atlantic Ocean at the end of the 15th century and they tried to describe those islands on the non-standard maps made primitively.Afterwards – within 10-15 years after the first travel of Columbus,any map describing unknown lands located in the west hadn’t been spread in Europe except Cantino’s map.Martin Behaim participated in the expeditions organi-zed by Portugals towards the western coasts of Africa for a long time and he had seen copies of some maps covering description of the territories located on the coasts of Africa.However,he didn’t know anything about the fourth continent.Nevertheless,some scientists mentioned that,as if Behaim sailed on the coasts between Florida and Brazil before Columbus and made some maps describing coasts,where he sailed.Historians think that,if Martin Behaim sailed in the western Atlantic,he could reach coasts of both con-tinents.They write that,he knew territories between Florida and Brazil before 1498 by basing on non-convin-  175 cing grounds.As if Behaim discovered South America together with anonymous captains of vessels of Portugal and sent important materials to Cabral for discovery of Brazil.1 The Nuremberq Globe of Martin Behaim (1492)1 Хеninг Р.НеvеDоmıе zеmli.Пеr.с nеm.М.,1963,t.IV,гl.198   176 If it is a truth,the cartographer of Nuremberg could describe coasts of the fourth continent on the first globe made in 1492,which was called Erdapfel.“There wasn’t any detail about the southern continent,located on the other side of the Atlantic Ocean,on the globe of the scientist”.1 It should be mentioned that,it couldn’t be proved that,Behaim reached America in 90th years of the 15th century as there wasn’t any historical document.Behaim knew that,maps of unknown and newly discovered lands were considered the most expensive documents.Andrea Bianco had made a map of the large land area basing on unreal ideas.According to Yul Oldham (1894),the Portuguese travelers discovered Brazil before 1448.He had read that,“there was an island at 1500 miles west”.Y.Oldham thought that,it was Brazil,which was situated at 1520 miles from Green Cape Islands.The Portuguese scientist Batalia-Reish also supported Y.Oldham’s idea,but that idea couldn’t spread in the 1 Дitmаr А.Б.Оt Пtоlеmеə Dо Коlumbа.М.1989,С.230   177 world.1 Nevertheless,it can be accepted as a hypothesis as some scientists support it.The map made by Alberto Cantino in 1502 is consi-dered the first map describing the New World.Existence of the mythical Anthilia in the west of the Old World was often mentioned by the scientists of the Ancient Times and Early Middle Ages.The islands discovered during the first travel of Columbus were named Cantino Anthill islands.There were writings “Western Ocean” and “Anthilia islands of the kingdom Castile” correspond-dingly on the upper and lower part of the map.The Genoese admiral described Cuba as part of the continent,but Cantino named it an island.How did this thought appear if Columbus wasn’t on the coasts of the New World when made that map? The Spanish traveler Sebas-tián de Ocampo proved in 1508 that,Cuba was an island.What about the land described on the northeast of the map? Was it Yucatán or Florida? Probably,it was Florida.It was discovered in 1513.1 Дc.Беyкеr.İсtоriə геогrафiçескiх оtкrıtiy i iссlе-Dоvаniy.ПеrеvоD с аnгl.pоD rеDакüiеy i с prеDiсlоviеm МагiDоviçа İ.П.М.,«İzDаtеlğсtvо inосtrаnnоy litеrа-turı».1950.сtr.44.  178 The world map made in 1502 by Alberto Cantino   179 Cantino’s map – Planisphera is considered decorative art sample.It included route to the New World used by Europeans during the Renaissance.According to the specialists,it was very valuable for that time.The navigation map made by the Portuguese is kept in Italy.Planisphera was made on the pergament and consisted of six parts.They were glued and the whole map’s measures were 2 m 17 sm – 1 m 02 sm.Alberto Cantino was considered one of the most interesting figures of his time.He worked in Portugal as the emissary.Whose emissary was he? The family D'Este was one of the influential families of Italy in the 15-16th centuries.They had a great role in management,collected historical objects,art samples and demonstrated them at the houses as well as Honzagas and Medicis.Ercole I d'Este,duke of Ferrara was interested in intellectual activities as well as the most rich Italians and got information about expeditions of the Portuguese by means of Alberto Cantino.He was an emissary and secret agent of the duke,who prepared reports on the most expeditions of the Portuguese.Cantino lived in Lisbon and duke asked him information about interesting discoveries made on the coasts of the New World and to send maps of mentioned coastlines to Italy.  180 It is known that,mentioned map was made by unknown cartographer,but not by Cantino.Cantino wrote to Ercole I d'Este in November of 1502 when he was in Rome that,he bought the map,which could be interesting for the research,for two ducats.The territories discovered during the second travel of Columbus were drawn exactly on the navigation map,which was consi-dered perfect for that time.The eastern coasts of the South America were descry-bed together with mountains on the map of the Italian cartographer Niccolo de Canario.How could the mountains in the east be described there,when Euro-peans couldn’t see mentioned continent? After all,the map was made by Canario in 1502-1504.Probably,the map,which is kept at the National Library of Paris,was seen by Vespucci and the Florentine accountant used it when wrote his letters.  181 The “second” travel of Amerigo Vespucci Vespucci needed a travel for his career.It was the travel towards the northern and northeastern coasts of the southern continent,organized in 1499.The Spanish traveler Alonso de Ojeda (1466-1515)was popular as the participant of the first travel of Columbus and he was known even at the palace.I want to mention the activity of the expedition led by him in 1499-1500.Juan de la Cosa,who was the owner of the vessel “Santa Maria” during the first travel of Colum-bus,also was a member of Alonso de Ojeda’s expedition.He was known as the cartographer,who drew lines of the unknown lands during the travel.As it is known,Vespucci also was a member of the expedition as the navigator.Ojeda’s expedition,which was consisted of four vessels,approached the Bay of Oyapoc located at 510 western longitude of the South America at the end of June of 1499 as it has been mentio-ned above.The leader had to research northern coast of the continent with two vessels and other two vessels had to wait for them.  182 According to the historical sources,Vespucci conti-nued his way through the southeastern route after Ojeda went to the north.He thought that it was Asia and wanted to reach the remote southeastern point of the continent.The Spanish saw two long rivers before Vicente Janez Pinson on July 2:One of the rivers flew to the Atlantic Ocean from the west in 30 km latitude (Amazon)and another flew from the south (Para).Vespucci sailed on boats to the outfall of one of the discovered rivers with food for four days and 20 seamen and investigated there.The Spanish returned to their vessels after two-day research and continued their travels towards east-southeast.But they couldn’t overcome more than 250 km because of the strong current.Thus,Spaniards discovered Guiana current,whose speed was 3 km/hour and which was the branch of the South Passat.Vespucci thought that,he reached 60 degrees latitude,but he sailed 1200 km up to Turiasu Bay located at 10 30/ south latitude and 450 west longitude or to San Marcos Bay located at 20 south latitude and 440 west longitude and returned towards the north-west.After Vespucci left Guiana Current,at first he continued his travel towards the north and then towards the northwest.He reached   183 Trindade with a small group and determined that it was 100 northern latitude.Though the Florentine accountant Alonso de Ojeda (1466-1515   184 described Hindus,who lived there,as cannibals,aborigines met the Spanish kindly and supplied them with food.Vespucci met with Alonso de Ojeda near the Cape of Codera after he left Trindade and gave information on four vessels.They continued travel together till September 1.The expedition was divided into two parts in the Cape of La Vela:Ojeda went to Hispaniola and Vespucci researched the coast in the southwest.The Florentine accountant reached the point,which was named Saint Efimia on Juan de la Cosa’s map,in two weeks.In other words,he researched 300 km coastline towards 740 30/ western longitude and changed the direction towards the north.Afterwards Vespucci wrote that,he overcame the dis-tance between the coast of the continent and Hispaniola.But Ojeda had reached Hispaniola in five days.1 It should be noted that,Alonso Ojeda’s main mission was to find lands,located in the south of Anthill Islands and to misappropriate adornments of aborigines made of the precious metals when he went to the coasts of the 1 İ.П.МагiDоviç,В.İ.МагiDоviç.Оçеrкi pо iсtоrii геогrафiçескiх оtкrıtiy.Москvа,II tоm,«Пrосvеhеniе»,1983.сtr.77-78   185 New World.Besides,route of the expedition had to be kept secret.The report on the results of the expedition should be prepared by Ojeda.But the map of discovered coastline should be made by Juan de la Cosa (the experienced seaman and navigator served in the navy of Castile even in his youth).Amerigo Vespucci’s suspicious travels   186 Ojeda couldn’t trust the person,who never sailed under the flag of Spain and hadn’t any fame achieved during the travels,when he sailed to the north in order to investigate coastline of the continent.He had friends and colleagues,who had navigation experience,were offi-cers,participated at the second travel of Columbus and knew certain territories of the Caribbean Sea very well.Ojeda might choose one of those persons instead of Vespucci,who was a bank employee of Florence.Ojeda knew who had appointed Vespucci for the expedition.The Spanish traveler knew that two of vessels of the expedition were financed by the Florentine bankers in order to get profit at the result of the travel and they sent their representatives to the expedition.Those representatives had to control everything,especially precious metals,which would be taken from aborigines.Their most suitable representative was skilful accountant and cosmographer Vespucci.The Florentine accountant would inform them about every necessary detail.Of course,Ojeda was aware of it.In order to overstate his “discovery”,Vespucci wrote that,his expedition had discovered eastern coasts of the South America towards 60 latitude.Though scientists noted that,vessels couldn’t sail down from 20 southern   187 latitude after parting with Ojeda.Thus,Vespucci lied on purpose.Vespucci could determine latitude of the place,where he had reached,as he was a skilful navigator.He was a specialist for such calculations.However,all calculations of the expedition were conducted by the Spanish specialists.After Vespucci reached the southern coast of Trin-dade,he noted on his diary that,Hindus,who lived there,were cannibals.However,afterwards he added that,aborigines met the Spanish travelers kingly and supplied them with food.Two versions may be noted on the investigation conducted towards the Amazon River:The Spanish sailed there and discovered delta of the Amazon River,or didn’t go away from the Bay of Oyapoc located at 510 western longitude.I think,the second version looks more convincing,because Ojeda couldn’t divide vessels,which were too important,into two groups.The rest of the vessels would be needed for carrying trophies,got from the aborigines.Probably,other vessels needed maintenance as they were damaged when passed the ocean and they had to sail towards the north after the maintenance in order to meet with Ojeda.  188 They met with Alonso de Ojeda in the Cape of Codera and continued their travel.It means that,the Florentine accountant lied when wrote that,part of the expedition discovered delta of the Amazon River.Why did he do so? Of course,he did it in order to achieve success.According to the first version,the Spanish researched coastline in the south when Ojeda continued his travel towards the north.But they couldn’t do it openly.It had to be done secretly.The Portuguese hadn’t to know it as they were going out of the demarcation line determined by Alexander Borgia VI.It meant invading lands given to the Portuguese by the Pope.The experienced staff,which would be able to complete secret researches,was needed for invading waters controlled by the Portuguese.Vespucci couldn’t be chosen for this purpose as he hadn’t experience on sea travels.As the mission was secret,expedition leader had also to be kept secret.Probably,only one of two vessels went to investigate waters,which belonged to the Portuguese,together with the experienced staff.Vespucci was in the vessel,which stayed in the bay.He couldn’t risk his life as was authoritative representative of the Italian bankers.Besides,the vessel,which went for   189 investigation,couldn’t go so far and it makes us to doubt on discovery of the delta of the Amazon River by the expedition of Ojeda.How could Vespucci declare such extraordinary discovery as his success? The Florentine accountant couldn’t overcome his ambition though his mission was to control everything happened during the expedition of Alonso de Ojeda as an authoritative representative of the Florentine bankers.Misappropriation of information on the second travel of Christopher Columbus by Amerigo Vespucci I came to the following conclusion at the result of investigations:Vespucci used some results and informa-tion got at the result of the second expedition of Colum-bus.I described some moments of the second travel of Columbus (1493-1496)above in order to prove it.There are a lot of analogous moments in the letters written by   190 different people,in different times and in different places.Whose notes were original? Dates of the letters prove that,Vespucci used the diary of Columbus.It is known that,diaries of the captains and chroniclers on the expeditions organized by the Spanish authorities to the coasts of the New World were presented to the authoritative representatives of the palace only.It was done in order to prevent espionage of information on discovered lands as there were many spies in the Spanish ports and large cities of the different kingdoms.Heirs of discovered lands informed the Pope and monarchs of the neighboring countries about the lands,which had become their properties.That’s why,a few persons – commanders,captains,notary,chroniclers and navigators knew routes and coordinates of those travels.Such persons had to be able to keep secrets.Then,how could other people learn such information? It was almost impossible.It was too difficult to get information about the discovery of the navy,which consisted of few vessels.But if the navy was consisted of 10-15 vessels,keeping secret wouldn’t be easy.Don’t forget that,the expedition of Columbus was consisted of 17 vessels and 1500 persons during the   191 Columbus’s expedition leaves coasts of the New World   192 second travel to the coasts of the New World (1493-1496).Most of the participants were the Spanish Hidal-gos and so,some information could spread by them.Ten thousands of people waited for the expedition impa-tiently.There is no doubt that,Vespucci also was among them.Thus,the colonialists,who returned from newly discovered lands,were interesting for the Florentine accountant and it wasn’t difficult for him to get corres-ponding information owing to them.As Vespucci knew some of them,he could realize his insidious plan even in one of the Spanish ports.According to some scientists of Spain,mentioned letters were written by other person and the Florentine accountant published them in Europe as his own works.It should be noted that,Vespucci was taught by his uncle,Savonarola’s close friend Giorgio Antonio Ves-pucci together with the future statesman of the Republik of Florence Piero di Soderini.He almost forgot to speak in Italian as always talked to the Spanish and Portuguese travelers.That’s why the letter sent to Soderini was full of grammar mistakes.Vespucci translated his first letter written to Pierfran-cesco de' Medici by means of his compatriot Giocondo into Latin from Italian before he sent.The Florentine   193 accountant did it as wanted to spread information on the discovery of the New World.Vespucci wanted to be known as the discoverer of the southern continent.There may be persons,who will not agree with me.However,I’m ready to prove that (as mentioned in the previous chapter)cannibals didn’t live in the coastline of Brazil and neighboring territories.If such people were really met,other travelers,who participated in the dis-covery of Brazil,as Alonso Ojeda,Vicente Janez Pinson,Diego Lepe,Bartolome Roldan,Gonçalo Coelho,Alonso Vélez de Mendoza,Pedro Cabral,Diogo Dias and Nico-lau Coelho would also write about it.However,those travelers gave quite different information about abori-gines,who lived in Brazilian coasts.1.The king of Portugal Manuel I sent Nicolau Coelho – the participant of the first expedition of Vasco da Gama to the coast for conducting researches when Pedro Cabral discovered Brazil on April 22,1500.Aborigines met the Portuguese kindly.They even tried to help the travelers.Though Hindus didn’t live far from each others,they weren’t aware of others existence.They were kind to the people,who came from the outside.  194 2.Pêro Vaz de Caminha – the participant of Pedro Cabral’s expedition wrote a letter in order to inform the king of Portugal Manuel I about the discovery and sent the letter to Portugal by means of Gaspar de Lemus.There were information about the relation with the Portuguese and aborigines,life styles of aborigines,their houses,weapons and jewelries in the letter.Hindus were described as kind and hospitable people.It turns out that,Vespucci was partly aware of Pêro Vaz de Caminha’s letter.I want to note one detail of mentioned travel especially.Pedro Cabral left two criminals,who were judged in Portugal and taken to Brazilian coasts,in Porto Seguro among aborigines and continued his travel.Besi-des,such experiment was conducted by other travelers,who went to Brazilian coasts after him.It may be noted that,perhaps other travelers didn’t meet cannibals,though Vespucci did it.However to my mind,Vespucci (especially after Alonso Ojeda’s expedition)had to know that,Hindus of Brazil weren’t cannibals.As I mentioned before,Pedro Cabral left two criminals in Brazil when it was discovered.The expedition of Gonçalo Coelho approached the coast after a year and took criminals,who could survive among aborigines.  195 Vespucci participated in that expedition as a cosmo-grapher.How could the Florentine accountant write that aborigines of Brazil were cannibals though he was a witness of that event? Besides,if such event occurred,he would note it in his diary.But he didn’t write anything about it.If Vespucci wasn’t witness of such event,it proves that he wasn’t member of Gonçalo Coelho’s expedition.However,some Portuguese scientists and especially Vespucci wrote that,aborigines of Brazil were cannibals,but Europeans,who went there,saw quite different scenes:They met children of criminals,who were sent into exile to those territories,and aborigine women.If aborigines were cannibals,they had to eat criminals left there.3.There was an armed conflict between Hindus and Vicente Janez Pinson,Diego Lepe,Bartolome Roldan and other travelers at the result of the travelers’ rude behaviours (in most cases they tried to captivate abori-gines in order to make slaves).Nevertheless,they also didn’t meet any cannibals in Brazilian coasts.They hadn’t a motive for giving false information.But Ves-pucci did it for his ambitions.He used letters of Diego   196 Chanca and admiral’s diary,written during the travel of Columbus.The scientists of Spain and Portugal,who realized that the Florentine accountant was a swindler,didn’t want to know discovered continent as America.As if Vespucci wanted to name mentioned continent New World,but Martin Waldsemuller named it America in spite of his request.It resembles the game of chess:professional Grand Master sacrifices pawn in most cases in order to win.Amerigo Vespucci wanted to prove himself in the right.However,he couldn’t be Grand Master among Titans.Vespucci could simply realize his insidious plan by deceiving his rivals owing to stolen important materials and authorities.What to say about the person,who wrote that,discovered the coasts of the New World in 1497? Though some scientists mention that,for the first time he went to that continent in 1499.According to almost all sources,the first travel of Vespucci was started in 1497.Such non-serious fact has been noted on the pages of the history owing to the information given by non-professional scientists.  197 According to the information given by Vespucci,he started that travel on May 10,1497 from Cádiz and returned on October 15,1498.He researched coasts of the Central America during his first travel.The expedition reached Honduras on July 4,1497,sailed to the north and returned in August of the next year.He discovered only two points (province of Lariab and Itea Island)during that travel.It is impossible to see them on the map.Probably,the first point was in Veracruz and the second was in Haiti.That island was discovered on the seventh day when the expedition sailed towards the east-northeast from the coast of the continent.As if Vespucci passed coastline of the Gulf of Mexico,sailed around Florida and even went towards the north during the travel.According to that information,the Florentine accountant had overcome 900 ligs (5000 km)on the coastline.They captivated 222 Hindus and took them to Spain.It was a record.It was impossible to carry 222 slaves in the expedition’s vessels through the long passage.Why didn’t corresponding questions appear when the letters spread in Europe? Vespucci used fantastic figures and extraordinary events in his letters in order to astonish people.The Florentine accountant sailed on that route for   198 the first time and it was impossible to carry 222 Hindus in the old vessels through the long passage.Besides,they had to have enough food for Hindus.It should be noted that,this information was given by Vespucci.Nobody,including well-known travelers,researchers,navigators and officials as Christopher Columbus,Alonso Janez Pinson,Vicente Janez Pinson,Alonso Ojeda,Francisco de Bobadilla,Nicolás de Ovando,Pedro Arias de Ávila (Pedrarias),Pedro Alonso (Peralonso)Nino,Cristóbal Guerra,Vasco Núñez de Balboa,Juan de la Cosa,Diego Lepe,Bartolome Roldan,Alonso Vélez de Mendoza,Diego Mendez,Rodrigo de Bastidas,Sebastián de

Guerrero,Francisco Hernández de Córdoba,Gaspar de Espinosa,Antón de Alaminos,Juan de Grijalva,Pedro de Alvarado,Diego Camargo,Gil González Dávila and Andrés Niño said anything about that expedition.Besides,Diego de Landa,who investigated activities of all expeditions and travelers,was an author of the important sources on occupation of the Central America   199 by the Spanish and participant of the expedition of F.H.Córdoba towards the northern coast of the Central America,and Bernal Díaz del Castillo,who was an aut-hor of the book “Real story of the occupation of “New Spain” (Mexico)” also didn’t write anything about it.Information on the travel in the letters written by the Florentine accountant,included anthropological informa-tion instead of geographical facts.Parallels and distances were overstated.According to some historians,Vespucci never sailed to the coasts of the New World in 1497-1498.According to the neutral scientists,it should be proved that,Vespucci’s travel of 1497-1498 was real.Bandini and Barlottsi,who investigated Vespucci’s letters,found three letters written to Lorenzo de' Medici at the state archive.They weren’t original,they were copies,collected by Valyenti.There were materials,letters,published notes and chronology of travels and discoveries there… So,the third letter,written to Loren-zo de' Medici,was found… Vespucci described the travel of 1499 as his first travel organized in 1497.Afterwards it was proved that,Vespucci or another person made two   200 Lorenso di Pyer Françesko del Mediçi (1449-1492)  201 fake travels of one travel and Vespucci lied when wrote that,he was discoverer of America.1 As if,he didn’t mean 1497 and didn’t want to steal the fame of Columbus.His supporters mentioned that,they were friends and respected each other when they were in Spain.They noted that Vespucci began to be judged after 30th years of the 16th century.He was even called the liar,swindler and adventurer.Though discovered continent was first named America by Waldsemuller in 1507.Vespucci’s supporters wrote that the Florentine accoun-tant didn’t do anything for it and even he and Waldse-muller didn’t know each other.1 С.Üvеyг.Соbrаniе соçinеniy v сеmi tоmах.ЗvеzDnıе çасı çеlоvеçесtvа.III tоm.Москvа,«ПrаvDа»,1963.сtr.427-428   202 Amerigo Vespucci’s “third” travel The Florentine accountant “had discovered” coasts of the New World during his “third” travel.I will write brief chronology of that expedition.Amerigo Vespucci was invited to the expedition of Gonçalo Coelho as the navigator under the leadership of the Portuguese in 1501.According to the task,results of the first expedition towards Brazil had been noted by the Florentine accountant,which wasn’t known by anyone.The expedition,which was consisted of three vessels,started its travel on May 10,1501 and reached the cape of San-Poca of Brazilian coasts on August 17.Travelers of the expedition sailed for more than five months on Brazilian coasts.The expedition reached 320 southern latitude on February 15,1502.The Portuguese officials appointed Vespucci commander there.After it,he began to pass the ocean towards the southeast.“Days began to shorten and darkness continued for 15 hours at the beginning of April.According to the calculations of the Florentine accountant,vessels reached 520 southern latitude.The coast was seen after four-day storm (According to I.P.Magidovich and V.I.Magido-  203 vich,the distance and parallels were noted wrongly:The island,which hadn’t a port,might be Trindade,located at 200 southern latitude and 300 western longitude).The travelers couldn’t go ashore because of the fog and wind.They sailed 100 km along the coastline.Travelers chan-ged the direction towards the north in winter and reached Sierra Leone of Africa after 33 days.They burned damaged vessel there and returned to Portugal on two vessels on September 6,1502”.I can disprove it.He wrote nothing about the leader of mentioned expedition – Gonçalo Coelho in his letter and made readers to think that the expedition was led by him.Why had the Portuguese officers to elect the foreigner as their leader,though vessels were brought to Brazilian coasts from the coasts of the Pyreness by the experienced captains? According to the book “Land of the Holy Cross” of L.Slyozkin,Vespucci went to the South America toget-her with Gaspar de Lemus,who was participant of the expedition of Pedro Cabral,who had returned from Brazilian coasts recently.The Florentine accountant didn’t note this fact as well.Was Vespucci aware of Pedro Cabral’s expedition and result of that expedition when he was in Spain?   204 Conducted works prove that,he was aware of discovery of Brazil.Details of that discovery were interesting for the Spanish authority as well.The Portuguese showed themselves indifferent to that discovery.They were really indifferent.The Brazilian researcher J.F.Pombu wrote about it:“Captain sent Gaspar de Lemus to Lisbon to inform the king about that discovery (discovery of Brazil – R.D.)”.Information prepared by that captain and expedition leader,letters of Pêro Vaz de Caminha and bachelor Juanish were sent to Don Manuel.Mentioned news didn’t cause surprise in Lisbon.Don Manuel harried to inform monarchs of other countries about it.However,he did it logically.He didn’t mention the discovery as the great success,but simply said that “An island,which could be used as the stopping-place for the travelers sailing to Asia was found”.These phrases prove that Brazil wasn’t disco-vered by accident.1 I have analyzed these issues in my scientific research book “Enigmatic discovery of Brazil”.1 Поmbu (Роşа-Поmbu)C.f.İсtоriə Бrаzilii.Пеr.с pоrt.7-е izD.Москvа,İzDаtеlğсtvо inосtrаnnоy litеrаturı,1962.сtr.30   205 Vespucci could establish relation with Gaspar de Lemus after Lemus returned to Lisbon.That’s why,according to the most sources,the Florentine accountant went to Brazilian coasts together with him in 1501.Gonçalo Coelho was well-known traveler of Portugal and Spain and so,he was appointed captain of the navy by the king of Portugal Manuel I when the second expe-dition towards Brazilian coasts was organized.This fact exposes one of Vespucci’s lies.According to the information given by Vespucci,they had reached 320 southern latitude,sailed towards the southeast from there and reached 520 southern latitude.Why did they sail too far in the south? If Vespucci wouldn’t return directly from 320 southern latitude,he could be satisfied with sailing down on the eastern coastline of the southern continent.It would be better as he would get opportunity to discover La Plata Gulf and the Strait of Magellan by sailing down towards 520 latitude on the eastern coast of the continent.Perhaps,if Ferdinand Magellan would discover the strait between the continent and Tierra del Fuego before the death of the Florentine accountant,he could present that discovery as his own success.It was impossible for him to reach the 52nd parallel of the southern hemisphere.Thus,this fact   206 has been disproved.Vespucci noted that,the expedition sailed 7000 km towards the north for 33 days.How could the tired expedition overcome 7000 km with old vessels under the storms in 33 days? Even if the weather was favourable and vessels were new,the expedition could overcome only 5000 km in 33 days.It was almost impossible for that time.It should be considered that,Vespucci passed the Atlantic Ocean from the east to the west in 67 days during “two” of “four travels”.One of the passages were between Portugal and Brazil (about 5000 km)and nobody could explain reason of such delay.Bartolomeu Dias overcame 10000 km in 6 months using stopping-places between Lisbon and south of Africa in 1487 and Vasco da Gama overcame that distance in 4 months in 1497.Pedro Cabral noted in his report that,he had overcome 7200 km between Brazilian coasts and southern end of Africa in 27 days.How could such coincidence occur? I have proved that,Cabral overcame that distance in 27 days.It means that Vespucci took that measure (7000 km)from the traveler’s report.Is it possible that,the Florentine accountant didn’t know anything about vessels and ocean currents? Could a cosmographer be so illiterate?   207 Amerigo Vespucci’s first meeting with Hindus in the New World At the result of researches,I came to the following conclusion:The expedition of Gonçalo Coelho never reached 52 or 420 southern latitude.Any decision wasn’t made when the vessels waited on the 32nd parallel – Brazilian coast and vessels went direct to Portugal under   208 the leadership of the captain Coelho.The expedition approached coasts of Africa (Sierra Leone)33 days after leaving Brazilian coasts.It means that,the expedition never travelled towards the south and it was simply Vespucci’s lie.Let’s look through chronology of that travel.The vessels passed near outfall of the Santa Lucia River on December 13 after leaving Porto Seguro and probably,that river was today’s Dosi River.The expedition passed near the Cape São Tomé (220 southern latitude)on December 21 and changed the direction towards the west.Afterwards the Portuguese saw the Guanabara Bay (230 southern latitude)on January 1,1502.They thought that the Guanabara Bay was an outfall of the river and so,named that place Rio de Janeiro – “January River”.That bay,which was considered suitable port for vessels,was first described on the world map,made by the admiral and cartographer of the Turkish navy – Piri Reis in 1513.Afterwards vessels of the expedition sailed 100 km towards the west – Angra dos Reis.The Portuguese we-ren’t satisfied with it.They passed the Southern Tropic on January 6 and discovered Saint Vincent Island at 240 southern latitude after 16 days.  209 Amerigo Vespucci’s unreal discovery   210 According to the historical sources,none of the geo-graphical points located at 200 km towards the southeast from Saint Vincent Island was named on the old maps of the “Santa Cruz lands”.The last name was Rio de Cananor (today’s Cananea River,located at 250 southern latitude and 480 western longitude).G.Coelho decided to return after reaching this point.According to the report of the expedition,one of the vessels left the navy under the leadership of Fernando de Noronha and reached Lisbon on June 24,1502.Other two caravels left Brazilian coasts on February 13,1502,sailed 3000 km towards the south and reached “new land” at 520 southern latitude on April 3,1502 according to Vespucci.Vespucci,who prepared his materials on the geogra-phical discoveries by means of exaggerations and lies,wrote that,the expedition investigated Brazilian coasts by going towards 320 southern latitude on February 15,1502 and then put to the ocean.However,other witnesses didn’t affirm it and there isn’t any note about it on the maps.The Florentine accountant wanted to make up fake success for himself – investigation of Brazilian coasts between 25 and 320 southern latitudes.Of course,it isn’t difficult to expose his lie.  211 According to the report of the expedition,two caravels left the point near the outfall of Rio de Cananor (250 southern latitude)on February 13.However,according to Vespucci’s letter,he reached 320 southern latitude on the Brazilian coast on February 15.Of course,it is nonsense.It was impossible to overcome the distance between 25 and 320 southern latitudes as it was equal to 770-780 km.Besides,there were different important geographical points – islands,peninsulas,outfalls,capes etc.on the coast between the outfall of the Cananea River and 320 southern latitude.If those points were discovered,they would be noted on the expedition’s report.It wasn’t done and it proves that,the expedition didn’t even pass near 320 southern latitude,it returned to Portugal directly from 250 southern latitude.Why did Vespucci give such false information? Didn’t he know that,he might be unmasked at the result of investigations? He chose such “effective” method in order to achieve fame.Though the expedition was led by Gonçalo Coelho,the Florentine accountant presented himself as the most important person of the travel.The world community didn’t know the truth for about 450 years.Most obscures began to be found out after the map,made in 1504-1505,  212 was found at the library of Fano,located at 130 eastern longitude on the coast of the Adriatic Sea at the end of 60th years of the 20th century.Brazil was noted as the “Land of Gonçalo Coelho” on that map.Coelho began to be known as one of the most important figures of the history of major geographical discoveries after that notable finding.1 The historians and other scientists may reproach L.Slyozkin and J.F.Pombu,who conducted investigations on the discovery of Brazil,with being indifferent to this fact.However,it wasn’t their fault.The book “History of Brazil” of J.Pombu was written in 1962.L.Slyozkin conducted investigations in 60th years of the 20th century for his book “Land of the Holy Cross”,but the book was published in 1970.They didn’t know anything about the map found in Fano.I mean,if the map,made by Gonçalo Coelho in 1504-1505,wasn’t found,the world community would know Vespucci as the leader of mentioned expedition.Vespucci’s lies expose him to ridicule among his colleagues,who had participated at the travel together 1 İ.П.МагiDоviç,В.İ.МагiDоviç.Оçеrкi pо iсtоrii геогrафiçескiх оtкrıtiy,II tоm.Москvа,“Пrосvеhеniе”,1982.сtr.59   213 with him,as they knew what his position was within the expeditions.They simply didn’t attach importance to the Florentine accountant’s activity.You may ask how Amerigo Vespucci knew that the weather was cold at 520 southern latitude,if he lied.Because nobody had sailed towards the south from the Cape of Good Hope before.As Vespucci knew astro-nomy and navigation,he knew that,the weather was cold at the latitudes close to the North and South Poles,even water basins were covered with ice in winter.The Florentine accountant made up his fake materials by considering all corresponding facts he knew.As you see,it isn’t difficult to unmask him.Scientists of that time had only to understand it.Vespucci had enough information on the expeditions,organized by the Portuguese towards the south of Africa,especially on the expeditions of Bartolomeu Dias,Vasco da Gama and Pedro Cabral.He knew that,the English and Portuguese expeditions conducted investigations on the northeastern coasts of the fourth continent.For ins-tance,expeditions of Giovanni (John)Caboto,Sebastian Cabot and Gaspar Corte-Real discovered unknown lands and noted them on the map.  214 When will Femida act for the name “America”? Vespucci died on February 22,1512.Historians tried to get his archive and diary in order to analyze his activity.However,Vespucci didn’t keep any document,gave all of them to his nephew Juan.Juan lost them,instead of keeping.It is so strange,because his nephew,who always worked with his uncle,was very experienced and cautious person and losing important documents wasn’t characteristic for them.How could such cautious person as Juan lose his uncle’s documents,which were historically important? Of course,the purpose was to hide Vespucci’s ruses.The Florentine accountant partly achieved his goal.He didn’t earn any property,only achieved a fame.Nevertheless,he had lost everything and wanted to get his share from lands located on the other side of the ocean.Vespucci was simply used against Columbus and then left alone.Who was Vespucci? Was he lucky adventurer or swindler,who could deceive scientists of his time profes-sionally? It seems that,even Vespucci didn’t expect such great success.Ten tones of gold and silver and plenty of   215 precious stones were brought to Spain from the coasts of the New World after the discovery of Columbus.Besides Spain,those trophies were used in Portugal,France,England and Holland.Authorities of those countries destroyed cultures of Hindus,which had been saved for hundreds,even thousands of years,and carried their stock of wealth to their countries.Whom had they to thank for it:Christopher Columbus or Amerigo Ves-pucci? Vespucci,who had come from the Apennine Peninsula to the Pyreness as an accountant,tried to introduce himself as a professional cosmographer during whole activity.Vespucci’s activity proves that,he lied in order to achieve fame and did his best in order to make people to believe that he had traveled to the New World for four times.He did it in order to steal fame of Columbus.Besides,the Florentine accountant tried to keep it secret and not to allow the Portuguese and Spanish travelers to know it.Almost all historians of the 17-18th centuries thought that,Amerigo was a liar,who tried to steal the fame of   216 Columbus achieved at the result of discovery of the continent.1 Amerigo Vespucci 1 АvаDəеvа Е.Н.,ЗDаnоviç Л.İ.Сtо vеliкiх mоrе-plаvаtеlеy.Москvа,«Веçе»,1999 г.сtr.78.  217 When the Florentine accountant spread information on his fake travels out of the Pyreness Peninsula,scientists noted it in the important documents as the historical fact.According to them,Vespucci had made courageous steps – he had traveled to the New World for four times,investigated coasts of the Yucatán Peninsula before the Genoese admiral and discovered the fourth continent.He wanted to be known as a genius traveler.Special talent was needed for making people to believe such lies and Vespucci could do it professionally.Then,who would correct mentioned mistakes? It should be done,because otherwise,supporters of the Florentine accountant as Alexander von Humboldt and Fridrich Varnhagen would appear and add new mistakes to the science.The researcher C.Baker wrote:“Some persons consi-dered him (Vespucci – R.D.)notable researcher,others called skilful butcher and all others described simply as an accursed person”.Vespucci decided to spread letters about his fake travels out of the kingdoms,where he lived,in order to prevent doubts.His lies could be accepted as the truth in the countries,where any witness didn’t exist.The accountant found many supporters around the Pyreness Peninsula and used them as propagandists using his   218 money and authority.The fourth continent was named in favour of the person,who hadn’t a role in the geographical discoveries,instead of the discoverer owing to mentioned propagandists.This mistake hasn’t been corrected though five centuries passed and the land,which was unknown before the end of the 15th century,is still known as America.  219 Achieved results 1.There were well-known travelers as Columbus,G.Caboto,S.Cabot,A.Vespucci and Giovanni da Verraz-zano,who were from the cities of the Apennine Peninsula at the end of the 15th century and beginning of the 16th century.They had great roles in the discovery of the fourth continent.Was it a coincidence? Those travelers never sailed under the flags of Venice and Genoa.They worked out of the Apennine Peninsula though were Italians:Columbus – Spain,G.Caboto and S.Cabot – England,Vespucci – Spain and Portugal,Gio-vanni da Verrazzano – France.The travelers of Catalonia and Andalusia of Spain,Sagres of Portugal,Brittany and Marseille of France had powerful navigation systems and they had investigated almost all eastern and northern coasts of the Atlantic Ocean.Besides,mentioned Italian travelers had sailed to the lands,located on the other side of the Atlantic Ocean.According to the results of the investigations,they had secret materials and maps proving existence of the fourth continent.They had achieved great successes in the field of the geographical discoveries.As if,they went to the   220 West Europe due to the task of the Pope and discovered the fourth continent.2.Scientific and educational centers were founded in Florence,Bologna,Padua and Pisa in the middle ages and leading scientists of those centers analyzed scientific works of the Muslim scientists.As the astronomy,mathematics,geography and cartography had been highly developed in the east,their works were interesting for the scientists of the west.They were mostly interested in the structure and measures of the Earth,coordinates and percentage of the land and water.Existence of the fourth continent was first known by the scientists of the East and they informed scientists of the West about it.It is not surprising that,captains and navigators asked well-known scientists as Paolo dal Pozzo Toscanelli for the advice before starting their travels in the second half of the 15th century.Vespucci and Christopher Columbus also gathered experience owing to Toscanelli before going to the Pyreness Penin-sula.Probably he began to be interested in navigation,astronomy and geography owing to the Florentine scientist.Both of them were known in the world as a cosmographer.  221 3.Vespucci,who worked at Lorenzo de Medici’s bank,went to Seville in 1942 due to his task and served with his fellow-countryman Capetto (Juanoto or Cua-noto)Berardi.As Cuanoto Berardi financed the second expedition of Columbus (1493-1496),Vespucci could be acquainted with the Genoese admiral and won his confidence.He was lucky for this acquaintance.One of the most important events of Vespucci’s life occurred in 1495.Cuanoto Berardi died in that year and the Florentine accountant had to conduct all jobs of the trade house.Vespucci,who had great authorities,got acquainted with many expedition leaders,who had sailed to the coasts of the New World,and learned a lot of things about discovered lands.Afterwards he tried to misappropriate successes of other travelers.4.Vespucci conducted forgery in order to make European community to believe that he was discoverer of the New World.He got acquainted with Columbus,Alonso de Ojeda,Juan de la Cosa and other well-known travelers in order to learn secrets on the discovery of the New World.Besides,letters of Vespucci about the coasts of the New World began to be published out of the Pyreness Peninsula.The Florentine accountant new that,those stories,which were full of fictions and extra-  222 ordinary events,would have great repercussions in countries of Europe,which didn’t know anything about the New World,and he would be known as celebrated sea traveler in France,Netherlands,Germany,Denmark and England.  223 5.Martin Waldsemuller presented Vespucci’s two letters (in Latin)and the research book “Introduction to cosmography” to the scientists at the geography circle in the city Sen-Dye of Lotharingia in France in 1507.The name “America” was used in that book for the first time.It means that the German cosmographer wasn’t aware of the activity of Columbus and presentation of discovered unknown land to the Old World though was interested in discovered coasts of the New World for a long time.6.Waldsemuller persisted in naming the land disco-vered by Christopher Columbus America.Members of the geography circle began to name coasts of the New World “America” basing on the map presented by Waldsemuller in 1507.Waldsemuller’s map was considered more exact in comparison with the map of Claudius Ptolemy and Paolo Toscanelli.7.The fact that Waldsemuller supported fraudful traveler and the German scientist’s speeches made in Sen-Dye prove that he and Vespucci knew each other.They kept it secret in order to prevent doubts.The German scientist had promised to inform his colleagues about the Florentine accountant’s works as   224 Vespucci gave him important materials and secret maps on discovery of the coasts of the New World.8.The Spanish didn’t want vessels of other countries to enter the Caribbean Sea when they discovered islands of this sea.Mentioned territory began to be controlled by the Spanish according to the Treaty of Tordesillas signed in 1494.The Spanish were sure that,the Portuguese entered restricted waters and conduct there illegal works.Vespucci could go to the other side of the Atlantic Ocean owing to his financial capital without any difficulties within Gonçalo Coelho’s expedition.Though mentioned expedition couldn’t reach restricted zone,he was sure that some vessels of the Portuguese sailed to the coasts of the Caribbean Sea with the purpose of intelligence.9.As Vespucci participated at the travel to the New World organized by Alonso de Ojeda (May 16,1499 – September 8,1500)as a merchant and wasn’t one of the leading figures of the expedition,it is injustice to remember the discovery of the Amazon River with his name.10.It isn’t difficult to understand that,Vespucci was a liar and adventurer.As if the king of Portugal invited him   225 to Lisbon with great difficulties and asked him to participate at the travel of Gonçalo Coelho.  226 Though according to the historical documents,Vespucci never met with monarchs and even never approached their palaces.He could get into contact with Ferdinand of Aragon by means of officials.According to his sentences,he was one of the most important navigation experts and the king Manuel I had to appoint him for the expedition towards Brazilian coasts.11.Vespucci described his travel of 1501-1502 to the coasts of the New World in the first letter,but he wrote in the second letter that,he had participated at four travels in 1497-1504.Besides,he noted that,he had reached coasts of the South America (1497)before Columbus.The first letter couldn’t bring success to the fraudful merchant,but he could deceive most scientists and steal fame of the discoverer of mentioned continent by means of the second letter.There were a lot of Spanish words in the Italian version of Soderini’s letter.All these facts prove that,Vespucci wasn’t an author of those letters.He simply learned letters of other travelers and did his best for spreading them.12.I want to note again that,32-page letters,which traveled through whole Europe,are copies of other letters and diaries.Vespucci thought that,the diary of Columbus   227 would never be published as it was a secret document,and so,everybody would think that,really,he was a discoverer of the southern continent.The Florentine accountant knew that,Columbus noted all significant events,happened during his first travel,in his diary and that document was given to the Spanish monarchs.It wasn’t returned to the admiral before he started his second travel and afterwards,Bartolomé de las Casas got it.13.There were lines of the fourth continent on the enigmatic map of Columbus.Probably,lower part of the southern continent on Martin Waldsemuller’s map might be copied from the “Lost map of Columbus”.Existence of that sensational map was interesting for whole world.It is interesting that,there were some similarities in descriptions of the South America by Waldsemuller and Piri Reis.The German scientist made that map 6 years before the Turkish admiral.14.The map made by Alberto Cantino in 1502 is considered the first map describing the New World.The Genoese admiral described Cuba as part of the continent,but Cantino named it an island.How did this thought appear if Columbus wasn’t on the coasts of the New World when made that map? The Spanish traveler   228 Sebastián de Ocampo proved in 1508 that,Cuba was an island.The eastern coasts of the South America were descry-bed together with mountains on the map of the Italian cartographer Niccolo de Canario.How could the mountains in the east be described there,when Euro-peans couldn’t see mentioned continent? After all,the map was made by Canario in 1502-1504.Probably,Vespucci saw copies of those maps when he was in Lisbon.That’s why,he had exact information about the New World before travelling there.15.I came to the following conclusion at the result of investigations:Vespucci used some results and infor-mation got at the result of the second expedition of Christopher Columbus.I described some moments of the second travel of Columbus (1493-1496)above in order to prove it.There are a lot of analogous moments in the letters written by different people,in different times and in different places.Whose notes were original? Dates of the letters prove that,Vespucci used the diary of Columbus.16.He researched coasts of the Central America during his first travel.The expedition reached Honduras on July 4,1497,sailed to the north and returned in   229 August of the next year.He discovered only two points (province of Lariab and Itea Island)during that travel.It is impossible to see them on the map.Probably,the first point was in Veracruz and the second was in Haiti.That island was discovered on the seventh day when the expedition sailed towards the east-northeast from the coast of the continent.Besides,Diego de Landa,who investigated activities of all expeditions and travelers,was an author of the important sources on occupation of the Central America by the Spanish and participant of the expedition of F.H.Córdoba towards the northern coast of the Central America,and Bernal Díaz del Castillo,who was an author of the book “Real story of the occupation of “New Spain” (Mexico)” also didn’t write anything about it.Information on the travel in the letters written by the Florentine accountant,included anthropological information instead of geographical facts.Parallels and distances were overstated.17.Vespucci didn’t write anything about the expe-dition leader of his “third” travel G.Coelho in his letter and so,everybody thought that,the expedition was led by the Florentine accountant.  230 According to the information given by Vespucci,they had reached 320 southern latitude,sailed towards the southeast from there and reached 520 southern latitude.Why did they sail too far in the south? If Vespucci wouldn’t return directly from 320 southern latitude,he could be satisfied with sailing down on the eastern coastline of the southern continent.It would be better as he would get opportunity to discover La Plata Gulf and the Strait of Magellan by sailing down towards 520 latitude on the eastern coast of the continent.It was impossible for him to reach the 52nd parallel of the southern hemisphere.Thus,this fact has been disproved.Vespucci noted that,the expedition sailed 7000 km towards the north for 33 days.How could the tired expedition overcome 7000 km with old vessels under the storms in 33 days? 18.The results of researches prove that,Amerigo Ves-pucci tried to present the Genoese traveler’s successes as his own achievements.He was even supported by the well-known scientists as Alexander von Humboldt and Fridrich Varnhagen.It seems that,they did it without investigating the Florentine accountant’s activity in detail.  231 19.Some scientists,who tried to justify Vespucci over many years,even centuries,wrote that,he was a great professional and never tried to steal achievements of Columbus,on the contrary,he made humanist steps in order to help him.They mean,he never betrayed Columbus and didn’t know anything about forged letters spread in Europe under his name.If it is true,why didn’t Vespucci raise objections to those compiled letters? Why didn’t he reject plagiarism organized by the publishers as the influential official of Spain? The answer is simple enough:Because,he was an author of the scenario of the performance organized by the publishers.  232 Literature Аbrаmсоn,М.Л.Кirillоvа,А.А.Коlесniüкiy Н.f.i Dr.; ПоD rеD.Коlесniüкого Н.f.İсtоriə сrеDniх vекоv:2-е izD.iсpr.i Dоp.Москvа,«Пrосvеhеniе»,1986.АvаDəеvа Е.Н.,ЗDаnоviç Л.İ.Сtо vеliкiх mоrеplаvаtеlеy.Москvа,«Веçе»,1999 АnDrе М.ПоDlinnое priкlöçеniе Хriсtофоrа Коlum-bа.Пеr.с фrаn.М-Л.,Зеmlə i фаbriка,1928 Афаnасğеv.В.Л.Тексt vосprоizvеDеn pо izDаniö:Баrtоlоmе Dе Лас Касас.İсtоriə İnDii.ЛеninгrаD,«Наuка»,1968 Беyкеr Дc.İсtоriə геогrафiçескiх оtкrıtiy i iссlеDоvаniy.Пеr.с аnгl.М.,«İnосtrаnnаə litеrаturа»,1950 Беyкеr Дc.İсtоriə геогrафiçескiх оtкrıtiy i iссlеDоvаniy.ПеrеvоD с аnгl.pоD rеDакüiеy i с prеDi-сlоviеm МагiDоviçа İ.П.М.,«İzDаtеlğсtvо inосtrаn-nоy litеrаturı».1950 Беyкlесс Дc.Аmеriка гlаzаmi pеrvооtкrıvаtеlеy.Пеr.с аnгl.М.,«Пrогrесс»,1969 Бlоn Cоrc.Аtlаntiçескiy океаn.ВеrlinDеn Ч.Хriсtофоr Коlumb,Эrnаn Коrtес.Росtоv-nа-Доnu,«fеniкс»,1997   233 Qasımov R.Әsrlәri qabaqlamış alim – Nәsirәddin Tusi.Bakı,“Yurd”,2003 Qasımov R.Xristofor Kolumb,Nәsirәddin Tusi vә Amerika qitәsinin hәqiqi kәşfi.Bakı,“Çaşıoğlu”,2002 Qоlаnt В.Ə.Пlаnеtu оtкrıvаli сооbhа.Москvа,«Наuка»,1971 Де-Qоmаrа f.«Оbhаə iсtоriə İnDiy»,1552 г.,XIII гlаvа,«Пеrvаə оtкrıtiə İnDii».Qоrсilасо Dе lа Вега.Тексt vосprоizvеDеn pо izDаniö,İсtоriə госuDаrсtvа İnкоv.Л.«Наuка».1974 Quləеv В.İ.Докоlumbоvı plаvаniə v Аmеriкu:miфı i rеаlğnосtğ.Москvа,«МеcDunаrоDnıе оtnоşеniə»,1991 Qumilеvскаə М.А.Как оtкrıvаli mir.Москvа,«Д.Л.»,1997 Hәsәnov T.,Hacızadә Ә.Coğrafiya tarixi,Bakı Univesite-tinin Nәşriyyatı.Milli Virtual Kitabxana.Bakı,2001 Дitmаr А.Б.Оt Пtоlеmеə Dо Коlumbа.Москvа.1989 Дitmаr А.Б.РоDосскаə pаrаllеlğ.Ciznğ i Dеətеlğ-nосtğ Эrаtосфеnа.Москvа,«Мıсlğ»,1965 Dәniz R.Braziliyanın müәmmalı kәşfi.Bakı,“Nasir”,2014 Әmrahov M.Böyük ipәk yolu.Bakı,“Mütәrcim”,2011 İоninа Н.А.Аvtоr-сосtаvitеlğ.Сtо vеliкiх çuDес сvеtа.Москvа,«Веçе»,2000 Коrоtüеv О.Как izmеrəli mir.Qlоbuс.Л.,«Д.Л»,1980 Кupеr f.Дc.МеrсеDес iz Касtilii ili putеşесtviе v Каtаy.ОDесса,«Маəк»,1985   234 Лас Касас Б.İсtоriə İnDiy.Пr.с iсp.Л.,«Наuка»,1968 Лiеlас А.Каrаvеllı vıхоDət v океаn.Пеr.с lаtış.Рiга,«Лiесmа»,1969 МагiDоviç İ.П.Хriсtофоr Коlumb.Москvа,«Qеогrафгiz»,1956 МагiDоviç İ.П.İсtоriə оtкrıtiə i iссlеDоvаniə Сеvеrnоy Аmеriкi.Москvа,«Qеогrафгiz»,1962 МагiDоviç İ.П.İсtоriə оtкrıtiə i iссlеDоvаniə Üеntrаlğnоy Öcnоy Аmеriкi.Москvа,«Qеогrафгiz»,1965 МагiDоviç İ.П.,МагiDоviç В.İ.Оçеrкi pо iсtо-rii геогrафiçескiх оtкrıtiy tоm II,Москvа,«Пrосvеhе-niе»,1983 Моriсоn С.Э.Хriсtофоr Коlumb – mоrеplаvаtеlğ.Пеr.с аnгl.Москvа,«İnосtrаnnаə litеrаturа»,1958 Мurоmоv İ.А.Сtо vеliкiх putеşесtvеnniкоv.Москvа,«Веçе»,2000 Пiсğmа Аmriго Весpuççi.ПеrеvоD с lаtinğского i itаl.«İzDаtеlğсtvо inосtrаnnоy litеrаturı».– В сb.Бriгаntinа – 71.М.,«МоlоDаə гvаrDiə»,1971.Поmbu (Роşа-Поmbu)C.f.İсtоriə Бrаzilii.Пеr.с pоrt.7-е izD.М.,«İzDаtеlğсtvо inосtrаnnоy litеrа-turı».1962.Пutеşесtviə Хriсtофоrа Коlumbа.Дnеvniкi,piсğ-mа,Dокumеntı,4-е izDаniе.М.,«Qеогrафгiz»,1961.  235 Саmin Д.К.Сtо vеliкiх nаuçnıх оtкrıtiy.Москvа,«Веçе»,2002 Саmin Д.К.Сtо vеliкiх uçеnıх.Москvа,«Веçе»,2002 Сlёzкin Л.Ö.Зеmlə Сvətого Кrесtа.Оtкrıtiе i zаvоеvаniе Бrаzilii.М.,«Наuка».1970.Сtrаbоn.Qеогrафiə.Пеr.с гrеçес.Москvа,«Наuка»,1964 Сvеt Ə.М.Коlumb.Москvа,«МоlоDаə гvаrDiə»,1973 Сvеt Ə.М.Тексt vосprоizvеDеn pо izDаniö:Пutе-şесtviə Хriсtофоrа Коlumbа.Москvа Сvеt Ə.М.Сеvilğскаə zаpаDnə.(Тəcbа о Коlumbоvоm nасlеDсtvе)Москvа,«МоlоDаə гvаrDiə»,1969 Сtinгl M.İnDеyüı bеz tоmагаvкоv.Пеr.с çеşского В.А.Каmеnскоy i О.М.Маlеviçа pоD rеDакüiеy Р.В.Кincаlоvа.Москvа.«Пrогrесс»,1984 Хаnке Х.ЛöDi,коrаbli,океаnı.Москvа,«Пrогrесс» 1984 Хеninг Р.НеvеDоmıе zеmli.Пеr.с nеm.М.,1963,t.IV,гl.198 Хriсtофоr Коlumb.Пutеşесtviе.Москvа,1952 Üvеyг С.Соbrаniе соçinеniy v сеmi tоmах.ЗvеzDnıе çасı çеlоvеçесtvа.III tоm.Москvа,«ПrаvDа»,1963   236 Table of contents Preface-Elucidation of enigmas concerning the travel of Amerigo Vespucci Amerigo Vespucci’s travels to the Mediterranean countries Vespucci’s enigmatic life Martin Waldsemuller and the geography circle of Sen-Dye Waldsemuller's decision caused great lie Naming the forth continent America was a great injustice The position of the head navigator was given to the person,who hadn’t achieved any important success in travels Suspicious moments in the letters written by Amerigo Vespucci Suspicious moments of Vespucci’s letters The Florentine accountant unmasked himself in his letters Vespucci realizes his scenario Intrigues against Christopher Columbus   237 Ambitions of Columbus and Vespucci’s ruse Vespucci’s manipulation skill Columbus shared his secret with Vespucci Important maps,which existed in the world before 1507 The “second” travel of Amerigo Vespucci Misappropriation of information on the second travel of Christopher Columbus by Amerigo Vespucci Amerigo Vespucci’s “third” travel When will Femida act for the name “America”?
