But the real turn of events once again introduced changes in the planned project.On one of the Russian-language stations in New York,lies were aired about the Baku pogrom.The lies were so bald-faced and cynical,and those who prepared and broadcast them were so unrepentant and certain that they would elude punishment,that I decided to delay the completion of the second book and respond to these rabid and insolent individuals.[9-10] My response would not have fit into an article or even into a series of articles,and took a smooth progression to a stand-alone book,which is presented now to our readers for consideration.[10-11] The Author.8 FOREWORD The appearance of this book is conditioned on the unresolved conflict over Nagorno-Karabakh (or NKC,the Nagorno-Karabakh Conflict)between Armenia and Azerbaijan.If during the outset of the NKC,Azerbaijan and Armenia were part of the Soviet Union,with the rights of the neighboring Soviet Socialist Republics,then at the present time,the NKC has grown into a conflict between two independent sovereign states,members of the United Nations.Initially,Armenia and the Armenians of Nagorno-Karabakh declared their unification into a single union,and with the support of Gorbachev,were de facto united.When the unification took place,with the military support of Russia,and the President of the self-declared NK assumed the seat of President of Armenia,a theory surfaced of three sides in conflict with equal claims-Azerbaijan,Armenia and the Republic of Nagorno-Karabakh (RNK).International society was not concerned by the fact that the RNK was part of sovereign Azerbaijan; that besides the RNK,the Armenian side had forcibly seized a fifth of Azerbaijan territory.A large portion of the Azerbaijanian population was destroyed.Formerly blossoming lands were turned into a barren "buffer zone." More than a million refugees resulted.[11-12] World opinion on the RNK was divided.Everyone already accepted the declaration of independence of territories within the body of the former USSR:Abkhazia,the Trans-Dniestr Region,Southern Ossetia,and now Nagorno-Karabakh.Why did Armenia not wish,all evidence to the contrary,for the world to consider the attachment of Armenians in NK to have been a fait accompli? There are many possible reasons.First of all,in the lingo of international rights at the time,Armenia could be characterized as the aggressor with regard to Azerbaijan,with all the consequences thereof.Secondly,the territorial integrity of Azerbaijan was undoubted.Both Nagorno-Karabakh and other regions on the plains of Karabakh seized by the Armenians belonged to Azerbaijan.Thirdly,Armenia hoped to be excluded from the conflict in public opinion.Why,it's only 8 million Azerbaijanians and 123 thousand Nagorno-Karabakh Armenians! Yet 3 million Armenians from Armenia have nothing to do with the strife.Consequently,NK,already been annexed de facto to Armenia under Gorbachev,split off from Armenia by those who are themselves Armenian (it is not known by which Armenians:those who lived in Armenia,or those living in NK,or by both jointly)and must exist autonomously.The theory of three sides to this conflict is replaced by a two-sided concept,but the other side of the conflict is not Armenia anymore but RNK.They wished to legitimize it in order to open the prospect of declaring,on the very territory of sovereign Azerbaijan,another independent Armenian state neighboring the existing country of Armenia.Fourthly:one shouldn't dismiss the mutual enmity and genealogical differences between Armenians from Armenia and those Armenians from Nagorno Karabakh.Armenians of Armenia were transplants to Azerbaijan lands from Turkey.The Armenians of Nagorno-Karabakh were from Persia (Iran).They never formed a unified whole.But then the logical question follows:whose forces occupied Nagorno-Karabakh and its many other outlying regions,which belonged to Azerbaijan? Maybe these were extra-terrestrials from UFOs? And did 123,000 Armenians of Nagorno-Karabakh have the right to impose their will upon 8 million Azerbaijanians? Even by force,even while enjoying the support of the global community? [12-13] Incidentally,regarding the global community (let us call it GC).When voices are heard in defense of the rights of the Azerbaijanian people,and facts are presented on the genocide of this people at the hands of the Armenians and their cohorts,no one in the GC wants to listen."Oh,come," they say,"what are you talking about? Azerbaijanis? These are barbarians and vandals.Armenians? They are an ancient,civilized,chosen,long-suffering nation.They even preserved their written language!" Of course,no one doubts their age nor written tradition.This is all so.But insofar as being a "chosen people," being "civilized" and "long-suffering":allow me to object.These stereotypes exist in the mind of the GC only thanks to the unprecedented ability of the Armenians to insinuate themselves as believable through magnificently-orchestrated propaganda.Let us try to examine,as objectively as possible,the aforementioned stereotypes.We will begin,if the reader allows,with their being a chosen people.The world has known for ages of a chosen people.Whether anyone likes it or not,the chosen people were and remain to this day only the Jews.The Lord chose them —may His name not be uttered in vain—in order to cast wide the light of the Torah and to disseminate it among other nations.How the Jews fulfilled the legacy of "dissemination" is of secondary importance.At the end of the day,that is their problem and they are to answer before the Creator for fulfilling their duty or failing to do so.But what is known for certain is that when the Jews were given the Torah,there was not even the scent of an Armenian within four thousand kilometers.They simply weren't there! Neither the Lord nor mankind chose the Armenians for anything.Quite the opposite,in fact.9 From a spiritual point of view,the Armenians were rejected.And they were rejected over 15 centuries ago.Before the Christian world was even divided into Orthodox,Catholics and Protestants.The Ecumenical Council of Chalcedon recognized the Armenian teachings as heresy,and those who followed them,as heretics.So from the point of view of Christian morality,Armenians are not chosen people at all,but banal heretics.This fact remained "forgotten" by the GC,or consciously ignored.Now,about their "civilization." This time we need not delve so deeply into history.It is much simpler than that.On October 27,1999,the "civilized" Armenians Nairi Unanyan,Vram Galstyan,[13-14] Karen Unanyan,Ashot Kniazian,Gamlet Stepanyan,Derenik Bedjanian,Edik Grigorian (not to be confused with the other,"civilized" Edouard Grigorian,who raped and murdered his Armenian cellmates during the Sumgait Pogrom.We will address this later.),with the help of other "civilized" Armenians,made their way into the building of the National Parliament of Armenia.Or rather,into its meeting chambers.Upon reaching the chambers,these "civilized" individuals,certainly possessing nothing but the loftiest of goals,in a "civilized" manner,shot the unarmed and unsuspecting Prime Minister Vazgen Sarkissian,Parliamentary Speaker Karen Demirchian,both of his deputies and several deputies of the Armenian Parliament with automatic weapons.Of course,this is the epitome of civilization,no? In the "civilized" capital of a "civilized" country,where a "civilized" president,Mr Robert Kocharian,presides in a "civilized" manner.In any truly civilized nation,after such an utter failure of his security services and the tragic death of absolutely innocent people of such high rank-elected representatives of the people,who are invested with great authority-the president would surely be obliged to retire,in a civilized manner.But then,we'll have none of that! Mr.R.Kocharian,who even as a private citizen of Azerbaijan,even before this terrorist act,deserved to be turned over to the tribunals just for his active participation in the genocide of the Azerbaijan population.One can only marvel as to why this "civilized" citizen has not been turned over by the Azerbaijainian prosecutor's office to the appropriate Interpol office.Temporary immunity is not a hindrance:for Mr.R.Kocharian hardly expects to sit in the president's chair forever.One might suppose further that commentary on the myth of the civilization of Armenians is unnecessary."Well,what about the Armenians being long-suffering?" the reader might ask.Permit us then,to offer the following:At first glance,everything is apparent.Armenians are long-suffering (meaning they are exclusively so),having been deprived of their Motherland,the land upon which their ancestors lived,and being forced to scatter throughout the globe.But are not long-suffering also then the once-closest neighbors of the Armenians,to [14-15] whom the Armenians are closely related,the Kurds? Their land was divided among Turkey,Syria,Iran and Iraq.The Kurds do not enjoy autonomy in even one of these countries.In contrast with the Armenians,the Kurds did not leave their homeland,but continue their struggle,hoping for the prospect of creating their own national government.The Kurds were unmercifully massacred,even with chemical weapons,that is,weapons of mass destruction.What about Ulster? What of the fate of the American Indians? The tragedy of the peoples of the North,who are dying out? The poor Africans who are being slaughtered by AIDS and hunger,who for these reasons die out by the tens of thousands every year? This list goes on and on.The Lord deprived the Armenians of their historic Homeland,it is true.But the truth of the matter is that the very same Lord,by the hands of the rulers of Russia (the Soviet Union),gave them another homeland.And this land is on the territory of Azerbaijan.If one considers the Armenians to be long-suffering,how should we then characterize the Azerbaijanians,from whom these "long-sufferers"-by force,with allies,with the material support of those in the diaspora-over the last few years alone seized hundreds of thousands of square kilometers of territory,destroying a multitude of absolutely innocent people and driving out over a million Azerbaijanians from their native hearths? Yes,those who are comfortable with stereotypes will find it difficult to believe that sons and daughters of these "long-suffering" people could ever become guilty of pogroms themselves.They will also find it difficult to believe that sons of this "long-suffering" people,who are mentioned in the Bible,are in fact murderers of defenseless old men,women and children.They could not be expected to believe that this "long-suffering" people,having had their own kings from the times of the Roman Caesars,are destroying foreign cemeteries.That these "long-sufferers," whose ancestors granted so many eminent figures as a gift to the world— looted the house of their hospitable host.10 It is a fair question to ask—how could all this have happened? Why—because the condition of being "long-suffering" is purely rhetorical.History knows of another people who gave civilization a greater number of worthy persons and who contributed treasures [15-16] to world culture,by several magnitudes outdistancing the Armenians,and yet who made another "gift" to the world-Hitler.Apparently,the "long-suffering" Armenians have found their own "Hitlers." Having no possibility of inflicting damage on the Turks,they decided to transfer their hatred to the utterly blameless Azerbaijanians.For Azerbaijanis speak a language similar to Turkish.Whether they wished this or not,the Armenian leaders led their people to the brink of disaster,which will leave them with no future.When they were driven out of Turkey,Armenians fled to Azerbaijan.But if they are driven out of Azerbaijan,where will they go then? Or will they rely on Russian military installations? What if talented diplomats "tie" the Russians' hands,and they will have better things to do than deal with the Armenians' problems? This precise scenario was already foreseen and prepared for by Geidar Aliyev of blessed memory.On the basis of a contract of the century,signed in 1994,an oil pipeline has grown along the Baku-Tbilisi-Jeihan axis.The Russian pipeline burst under the pressure of the freedom-loving Chechens.In the political sense,Baku-Tbilisi-Jeihan could mean only one thing—the departure of Russia from the Trans-Caucasus.It came time for the "long-suffering" Armenians to think about ensuring that their children and grandchildren do not ruin the work of their fathers and grandfathers.The fathers and grandfathers will depart with time.But returning the seized territories will be left to their children and grandchildren.Though there is not much time left,there is some.True,with every passing day,less time remains.[16-17] 11 ARMENIA A country with ever-changing borders,drifting throughout the territory of Asia Minor [17-18] 12 13 14 THOSE WHO VIOLATE THE SACRED LAWS OF HOSPITALITY But for what? The alien Armenians and their cohorts killed Azerbaijanians and drove them from their own land.Indeed,for what? Because the Azerbaijanis saved the Armenians from complete destruction in Turkey and Persia,giving them asylum on their land during the 19lh century? It may be that they did not grumble and object when the Armenian Soviet Republic was situated upon native Azerbaijanian land,where it now calls itself the independent government of Armenia? Maybe because the Armenian refugees from Persia were given the best lands in Karabakh? Maybe because a multitude of Armenian marshals,scholars,champions,artists,composers,writers and other world-famous people were fed and raised on Azerbaijanian bread and water? Does one repay hospitality,room and board with murder? Apparently,yes.But why? Because for the politicizing leadership,drawing behind itself the majority of the Armenian population,all of the above was [17-18] not enough.Not enough.That is why the Armenians declared remaining Azerbaijanian territory to be their own and unleashed a war to destroy the progeny of those who saved the Armenian forefathers in difficult times.Could this be? Not only could it be,but it is happening in our recent history,from 1987 to the present.Since then,the trauma and sorrow of the Azerbaijanian people has been diluted within current international problems.Azerbaijan has been forgotten.The world pretends that no problem exists.Moreover,the Azerbaijanian nation is being depicted by the Armenian side as being evil.Here is one of a multitude of examples.I found on an internet site the following qualification of the traits of the Azerbaijanian people:"a creature,only through misunderstanding called human."The authorship of these words is ascribed to an Armenian by the name of L.Melik-Shakhnazarian.Such is Armenian "gratitude." Who is this ostensibly educated gentleman,publishing works on the internet,considering himself an Armenian,yet who signs his name with an Azerbaijanian surname,daring to speak these words of the 8-million-strong Azerbaijanian nation,who 150 years ago gave succor to the Armenian refugees from Persia on the land of the Karabakh khans? The author of these vile words,judging by his surname,is doubtless a descendant of those very same refugees.If his last name is translated from the Azerbaijanian,melik ("prince" or "chieftan")is one who was appointed by the shah to oversee.That is,he is a descendant of the Persian meliks appointed to his post by Iranian shahs.Specifially Iranian,for nowhere else in the Muslim world were monarchs called "shahs." And what scum are the Persian Armenian meliks was demonstrated by the well-known Abo and Mejnun,who fled Iran under the protection of the Georgian King Erekle II.This monarch took them in,warmed them and gave them gifts.But as soon as the Iranian Shah Agah Muhammad Khan went to war against Georgia,these two meliks returned to the Shah of Iran and secretly,as Iranian spies,led the Persian forces to the rear of the Georgian army.Agah Muhammad Khan burned Tbilisi and drowned Kartl-Kakheti in blood in 1795.A textbook example.For such is Armenian "gratitude." There is one other situation of some importance.Those who served the shah,especially in the role of meliks.could not remain [18-19] non-Muslims.The conversion to Islam by those of other faiths who were officers of such rank in Iran was an absolute requirement.Consequently,Melik-Shakhnazarian is a descendent of Armenian Muslims.His very surname is a direct proof.Such Melik-Shahnazarians,descendents of the monophysites,rejecting Orthodoxy,uniting first to the Shi'ites,then to the Sunnis,then falling away from them and yet prepared to besmirch entire nations,can unfortunately still be found among the Armenians.So everything he said about the Azerbaijanians is true about his own person,and cannot be applied to the Azerbaijanians at all.Naive people may ask:"Why is world opinion silent?" It is because this "opinion" has long ago become a slut,ready to sell herself in the shadows of the closest doorway for a dollar.And as a rule,those who are closest to this slut are the "Melik-Shakhnazarians." One need not search far for examples.On about February 24,2004,the anchorwoman of the Russian-language television station RTVI in New York,Marina Levinson,reported to millions of viewers that during the strife of January 1990 in Baku,250,000 Armenians died.The naive would say:"Well,why should we care? She misread something.Maybe the text wasn't printed clearly.The comma was in the wrong place,maybe.Or the digits looked different.All this can happen on the editor's desk:someone else wrote it,there was a mistake,it was out of context." Yet it is worthy of attention.A clear cause-and-effect connection is evident.Judge for yourselves.Two hundred fifty thousand Armenians never lived in Baku.Before 1987,there were some 200,000.By January 1990,there were approximately 15-20,000.But here is the most important thing! The number of Baku Armenians who died was increased by Levinson—by 6,000 times! 15 Those who are not familiar with the Armenian problem in Asia Minor and the Caucasus could have ignored this slander.Still,one can compare certain facts.Over the course of the period of my generation,one often came across the so-called "genocide" of Armenians in Turkey.Over the last 50 years,the Armenian side constantly manipulated the number of their countrymen who were victims of this "genocide." First the figure given was 800,000.Then,with time,the num-[19-20]ber of victims grew:900,000,a million,one million three hundred thousand,and finally,1.5 million.Some time later,the number was lowered,and they settled on 1,200,000.Moving in parallel with this process of change and "corrections," eyewitnesses and observers would also notice periodic changes made to this number of victims on the memorial in Yerevan.The ability of the Armenian side to allow themselves to change the inscriptions of the memorials they themselves erected-in accordance with the changing circumstances-is well known.An example of this is the obelisk built in 1978 in the town of Leninavan (Maragashen)of the Mardakert Region of Nagorno-Karabakh in honor of the 150th anniversary of the re-settlement of the first two hundred Armenian families from the Persian city of Maraga to Karabakh.After the publication of this fact in the journal Istorii,filosofii i prava Akademii nauk Azerbaijana ["Histories,Philosophies and Rights of the Academy of Sciences of Azerbaijan"] in 1988,the number "150" etched on the obelisk was deleted.This comedy of errors regarding the number of Armenians killed in 1915 shows that these numbers cannot be considered plausible,and there is a great likelihood that the Armenian side was to blame for this falsification with the purpose of deceiving international society into recognizing this so-called "genocide." Further evidence of such a conclusion is the following undeniable fact:The number of victims cannot change through the desire or whim of one group or another who represent the leadership of the Armenian nation at any given period.For those who have departed for another world are deprived of the opportunity of changing their numbers,or to die a second time.Despite all this,some countries in which Armenian colonies have become influential in the political spectrum,among them France,are prepared to officially recognize this "genocide." Still,it is unlikely that such French recognition will bring any good to the Armenian side,probably the opposite.For this sudden love for Turkish Armenians of 1915 takes on a foul odor against the backdrop of the utter disregard for their own Jewish citizens,whom these "loving" French dispatched in whole echelons to Nazi death camps for extermination at the request of Germany in 1943-44.At the same time,even such odious figures,allies of Hitler,such as Mannerheim [20-21] in Finland and Franco in Spain,ignored the Gestapo's demands and protected the Jewish populations in their countries.This is food for thought.In order to finally and irreversibly clarify whether there was any "genocide" of Armenians in 1915,one must turn to an international committee,and not "facts" which are helpfully proffered by the Armenian side.No one can prevent us from analyzing materials which are readily available in the open press.Armenian activists of various ranks have averred for almost a century that the Turkish side set for themselves the goal of destroying all Armenians living in Turkey.Yet the facts contradict Armenian opinion.Had the Turks decided to destroy all Turkish Armenians,they would have doubtless done so,since at the time,no one could stop them.But the Turks never had such aims.Independent sources cannot but confirm that the Armenians were not prevented from resettling in other countries during those terrible times.Six hundred thousand Armenians moved to Mesopotamia,300,000 to Russia,200,000 to the countries of Europe,etc.That is,over one million Armenians left their historic homeland and saved themselves.How many Armenians lived in Turkey before the events of 1915? Armenian sources insist that it was 2.5 million.They are,of course,being disingenuous.How could there have been 2.5 million when by that time,for over 6 centuries,Armenians were scattering throughout the whole world? For the Armenian monarchy ceased to exist in the 14th century and it was absorbed by Turkey.The events of 1915 belong to the 20th century.For some 600 years,Armenians consistently streamed out of Turkey.Those same sources state that Armenians successfully formed colonies in over 70 countries.One can confidently assume that in 1915,there were not 1.5 million Armenians,but far fewer.Acknowledging the ability of the Armenian side to add zeroes to the number of actual victims,one can,with a fair degree of certainty,state that in 1915,not 1.5 million,but some 100,000 or a maximum of 150,000 Armenians died,which in and of itself is,of course,horrifying.In regard to the knack for adding zeroes,this became known long before 1915.In 1896-1897,for example,in Armenian-controlled newspapers reporting on events connected to the terrorist actions [21-22] of Armenian militant groups in Istanbul and the anti-Armenian pogroms they precipitated.One witnesses the same thing today.Ms.Levinson did not simply add a little zero,but a whole 6 with three zeroes.Technology is making great strides,we can see! And how everything is played off! The Armenian side is not involved.If the monstrous lie of Levinson is denounced,then she alone was responsible."Who is this 16 Levinson,anyway,we don't know her and have nothing to do with her." Representatives of Armenian society can say something along those lines on the conclusions outlined above.How could they? But they already do! That is what the Assistant Editor of the Russian-language newspaper V novom svete ["In the New World"],Mr.Eduard Parian,told me when I asked him to print a rebuttal to Levinson's lie in the publication he edits."Who is this Levinson? We don't know her." And so on and so forth.It is worth noting that the slander uttered by Ms.Levinson has a second aspect.She failed to mention that the number of victims of the very same events in Baku among Azerbaijanians,Russians,Jews and those of other nationalities is far greater than the number of Armenian victims.That the self-same killer worked against all of them:the repressive machine of the Gorbachev regime.As already noted,I took upon myself the attempt to counter the slander broadcast by the Russian television station in New York through the Russian-language media.So I turned to well-known and authoritative Russian-language publications,whose editors are constantly appearing on the television screens of the Russian-language stations and enjoy great influence within respectable society.The first of these was David Gai (Russkaya reklama ["Russian Advertising"]).At one time,when he was an editor of the newspaper Evreiskii mir ["Jewish World"],sometime in 1996,1 asked him about the improper dealings of the then-president and owner of a company called People Travel Club,Marina Kovaleva.He received me at his offices on 8,h Avenue in Manhattan more than gregariously.Mr.Gai explained to me that he could not publish my material with regard to Ms Kovaleva,since he did not wish to involve himself with this scandalous lady.But he would try to get Kovaleva to do right by me.Some time passed.Gai could do nothing,and this "madam," of course,did not repay what she owed me.But I was still left with a fa-[22-23] vorable impression of Mr Gai for some reason,as a kind,circumspect intellectual,very much like a member of the Leningrad intelligentsia.I have only met such amicable people there,back in the 1960's.So I turned to him first.Gai received me without any fuss.Of course,he had not found anything out,for many years had already passed,but he responded directly and categorically:"I will not print your item.Levinson is not guilty of anything.Your version is one-sided.I know the situation from both sides." and so on and so forth.He could not understand Levinson's guilt in the presence circumstance.The television station broadcast slander.This was a confirmed fact.My article could be discussed.It could have been reduced to a few lines,but at least their readers would be informed of the error (for most were also the audience of the television station).This likely would have forced the TV station to make a retraction and apologize.But nothing happened.The second person I turned to was Valery Vainberg {Novoye russkoye slovo [New Russian Word]).I will say frankly that I held out little hope for him.Still,he is one of the owners and editor of the leading Russian-language newspaper,and I did not wish to ignore him.But then I knew that he was an arrogant person,that he neglected the newspaper for a long time,that he makes gross errors,and I knew that talented editors keep leaving the newspaper one after the other.Here is a prime example of the carelessness of Mr Vainberg,his complete disregard of who edits the newspaper he owns,and how they do it:It was the Friday edition of Novoye russkoye slovo of September 14,2001,three days after the horrifying tragedy of September 11th,which took the lives of over 4,000 human lives.Almost every page recounts the terrorist act,the search for bombs in public places,the search for survivors in the World Trade Center (WTC),the sorrow that struck the natives of New York.And suddenly!!! An advertisement placed by Discovery Travel Services inviting the readers to visit the 110-storey Twin Towers of the WTC and enjoy the view of New York from the observatory.What towers,you ask? Why,the very same ones whose destruction Mr Vainberg's newspaper recounted for the readers on the preceding pages of the very same issue.[23-24] Mr.Vainberg insulted the memory of the terrorist act of September 11th,spit in the face of the relatives of the victims,he spit in the face of the entire American people,and yet—remained squeaky clean.Naturally,when one has a meeting with someone of this type,one can bear no illusions.But that's the point,that besides this gentleman,there was no one who could give the okay for publishing any kind of material in the paper,because he is the owner.And so everything proceeded in order.On July 8,2004,at 10:30 in the morning,I arrived at the offices of Novoye russkoye slovo.It was immediately apparent that the paper was not enjoying its best days.It moved from prestigious Fifth Avenue to a long-un-swept West 37th Street.I was not permitted past the reception desk.A complete line of defense was set up.Rushing to the aid of the pleasant-looking secretary named Yana was a Pole named Voldemar,the Front Desk Manager.I must admit that despite having visited a great many offices of prestigious companies,I had never before come across a "Front Desk Manager" in America.It seems the newspaper is trying to set some sort of world record for originality and uniqueness.But that's their problem.Finally,after long negotiations with Yana and the Front Desk Manager,my manuscript was accepted with the promise that it would be delivered to the Department Head,to someone called Felix,and it was 17 suggested that I call (646)218-6900 on Wednesday,July 13,2004.Just in case,I handed a copy of my manuscript to another Bakuite who worked there.He guaranteed that Mr.Vainberg would read the document.On Wednesday,I dialed the number.Yana replied that this is not material fit for publication.My friend told me that the manuscript was given to Mr.Vainberg.Present at the time was another editor by the name of Yarmolnik.He quickly scanned the text,after which Mr Yarmolnik,with the consent of Mr.Vainberg,said "So what,someone misspoke." They would not print the article.In their opinion,there was no reason to.After Novoye russkoye slovo,I headed for 55 Broad Street to the offices of V novom svete ["In the New World"].I already presented above what the general opinion of editors was of my rebuttal,as expressed by E.Pariyan.From my discussion with him it became clear that the aim of their paper was to project into the American [24-25] information market the mainstream point of view within the Russian Federation on various political events.A Trojan horse of sorts of Russia in the USA.The topic of my article did not conform to the general line.I had a telephone conversation with the so-called editor of Vechernii Nyu-York,Mrs.Nargiz Shekinskaya,at 7 p.m.on July7,2004.At first this conversation gave me some encouragement.Mrs.Shekinskaya declared something like the following:"Yes,I heard of this report by Levinson.Why didn't you call me right away? Bring me the article,we will print it.If I am not here,give it to Slava." I brought it.submitted it.Some time passed,and at 5 p.m.on July 26th,Slava reported to me that Mrs.Shekinskaya categorically decided that the article cannot be published in Vechernii Nyu-York,without offering any explanations.No,and that was final! Apparently,corporate solidarity held firm; for Shekinskaya and Levinson work at the very same Russian-language television station.As the Azerbaijanian saying goes:"It itin ajagini tapdalamaz-" meaning 'A dog will not step on another's toes." So in sum,the Russian-language newspapers refused to print my refutation.There is a wonderful,well-aimed adage in Azerbaijanian:"Horuz banlamasa—sahar achilmaz?" or "If the cock doesn't crow—does morning not arrive?"The answer is apparent.Whether or not the cock crows,dawn will come nevertheless.If we apply this adage to the present situation,the "cocks" refused crow,but morning came anyway—the article denouncing this bald-faced lie still sees the light of day.Here they are.The first was sent to the Russian-language media,the second to the English-language press.It is very likely that when this book is published,with God's help,they will appear in the pages of American press.WHO ARE YOU,MARINA LEVINSON? For the 10-plus years that I have lived in the wonderful city of New York,in the blessed American land,I have many times come across speculation on the matter of pogroms of the Armenian population in Azerbaijan.First one,then another Russian-language publication printed all sorts of ponderings of individuals who know little,if anything,about the topic,or who know the facts but dissemble.As a result,readers are offered lies instead of the truth,half-[25-26]truths instead of serious research,and this whole mass of disinformation,as I see it,remains unanswered and uncommented-upon.Residents of Baku during the period 1987-1990 who experienced the horrifying pogrom of January 1990 remember well how the events unfolded and how smoothly the machine of disinformation and duping of the rest of the Soviet population ran,juxtaposing the "peaceful" Armenian population with the "barbarous" Azerbaijanians.This machine was set off by Mikhail Gorbachev,and its more talented representatives were such luminaries as G.Starovoitova and G.Borovik.But even if they did not achieve the heights attained by the slanderous opportunist Marina Levinson.Yes,the very same M.Levinson,anchor of the Russian-language station RTVI.Some time ago,reporting on the memorial service and other measures dedicated to the date of the Baku pogrom,she publicly stated on television that 250,000 Baku Armenians were killed during the Baku pogrom of 1990 (in reality,the number of Baku Armenians killed was —and remains~38).She is an opportunist because she plays upon the sensibilities of those who had survived the tragedy,knowingly deceiving her viewers and subscribers with the intention of strengthening her image and the channel's ratings.She is a slanderer because she injures the memory of the victims,imparting to them the unimaginable and impossible ability to multiply after their physical death — and on such a scale! One must admit that the "successes" of Ms.M.Levinson correspond to the well-worn,tried-and-true path used by many commentators,including Russian-speaking ones.Especially now,against the background of anti-Islamic and anti-Muslim hysteria gripping everyone."Muslim" means "bad," "Christian (or Jew)" means "good." This injurious world view is thoughtlessly transferred to Armenian-Azerbaijanian relations:an Armenian Christian can only be "good," an Azerbaijanian Muslim — "bad." It is upon this harmful basis that the common opinion stands that the "peaceful" and "good" population of Nagorno-Karabakh in February 1988 wished to gain independence and to rejoin the native populace of 18 Armenia.For this,the "bad," "barbarous" Azerbaijanians began to murder them,organizing pogrom after pogrom.But if the "peaceful" and "good" desired their independence,there could be nothing simpler — they could have packed their bags and [26-27] moved the "better people" of Armenia.But that is the crux of the matter,the "good" people wished to take with them additionally the land of the "barbarians." By 1994,the "peaceful" and "good" people,with the help of others — no less "peaceful" and "good," and living significantly further north — took away from the "wicked barbarians" a fifth of their "barbaric" country,declaring this stolen land their historic territory.More than one million "barbarians" were driven out of their homes,and their property was looted and taken by the "peaceful" and "good" people.And now,let us be more specific,and lose the quotation marks.With the aim of preserving the authority of the Communist Party (meaning their "comfy chair"),Gorbachev needed a great deal of blood,so that in the eyes of the world he could justify the introduction of a militant dictatorship,for at that moment (1987-1990),there were no other means of preserving the existing regime.The peoples of the USSR were emerging from the control of the Party nomenklatura and did wish to live as before.They mustered the power of national independence movements,especially in the Caucasus and the Baltics.For this reason,Gorbachev invented and executed a conspiracy whereby two neighboring peoples (in this case they turned out to be Azerbaijanians and Armenians),would squabble over debatable territories,ensuing in a bloody conflict,and the "white knight," Gorbachev,would ride in,using military might to introduce iron order and discipline.Everyone again became obedient and no one could even think of changing anything.According to this scenario,Gorbachev's lackey,A.Aganbegyan,gave the opening salvo on November 18,1987,in an interview to the Parisian newspaper Humanite.Some time later,on February 20,1988,the Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous Region — NKAR — declared its withdrawal from Azerbaijan.Immediately,the synchronized ejection of Azerbaijanians from NKAR and Armenia commenced.Could it be that those who began to drive out the Azerbaijanian population from NKAR and Armenia did not understand that the arrival in Baku of the first Azerbaijanian refugee would automatically turn all Armenians then living in Baku and other areas of Azerbaijan into hostages,and that they would find themselves in grave danger? Of course they knew.[27-28] But the delirious dreams of creating a "Greater Armenia" remarkably fell in line with Gorbachev's scenario,and the organizers forcibly ejected the Azerbaijanian people from NKAR and Armenia,consciously sacrificing to their ambitions the interests and very life of the Armenian people living in Azerbaijan.The absurdity and inhumanity of such an approach is obvious.But when the backlash occurred,when the counter-ejections and counter-pogroms began,those who provoked them began to wail hypocritical sympathy for the dead and suffering.By February 23,a few thousand refugees arrived in Baku,hoping to learn from the authorities what was happening.But the Baku government itself did not know what was happening and turned for clarification and instructions to Moscow.But Moscow (read:Gorbachev)was silent.By that time,the situation grew in intensity.The number of Azerbaijanian refugees,fleeing their homes in NKAR and Armenia in panic,grew by the hour.They were all taken away from Baku to Sumgait,further from temptation.On February 24,armed Armenians gunned down a group of Azerbaijanian youths in an ambush in the Askeran region on Agdam-Stepanakert Road; two were killed and 19 injured.That which Gorbachev had so desired happened.Blood was spilled.The first dead were Azerbaijanians.On February 28,a pogrom followed in Sumgait.Twenty-six Armenian residents were killed.On November 27-28,1988,a pogrom in Gukark.Thirty-three Azerbaijanians are killed.In December 1988 to January 1989,ethnic cleansing in Armenia.Two hundred sixteen Azerbaijanian residents are killed.On January 12,1990,in the town of Gushchu,Hanlar region,Armenian fighters,supported by helicopters,kill several dozen local Azerbaijanians.January 1990:the great pogrom in Baku,where the Soviet government turned out in full force.Special Forces were deployed,soldiers of the MVD [Soviet Ministry of Internal Affairs],regular troops,Armenian reservists from Krasnodarsk and Stavropol.Outside invading forces are led by Minister of Defense Yazov.From inside Baku itself,the entire operation of the Special Forces and the MVD was led by professional spy Primakov.In order to paralyze the will of the locals,the television building was blown up.On January 13,the agents of the Special Forces under cover of two divisions of the MVD began the beating of Baku Armenians.But the residents of Baku quickly came to their neighbors' defense.[28-29] They were saved,they were bidden in apartments,taken out in ferries to Krasnovodsk,evacua hd through Bina Airport.But there were still victims.By the beginning of the pogrom in Baku,there were no more than 15-20,000 Armenians.The rest of the Armenian population,some 200,000 people,had long ago fled Baku.Among those Armenians found inside Baku,the vast majority were saved.The pogrom did not achieve the levels sought by Gorbachev utter destruction of Baku Armenians was halted,but only so that on January 20 it would continue with renewed brutality.By order of Primakov,Baku was invaded from three sides by regular 19 troops,supported from within by MVD divisions,and in revenge for the sabotage of their plan to eliminate the Baki Armenians,they began beating the peaceful population of Baku regardless of their nationality.People were killed at random.In the course of the unprecedented slaughter,added to the 38 Armenians previously killed were those crushed by armored vehicles and killed not only in the streets of the city but in their apartmenl:157 Azerbaijanians,6 Russians,3 Jews,2 Tatars and 2 Lezgins.The tried-and-true methodology of Baku was in 1992 successfully applied by the Armenian troops during the destruction of the Azerbaijanian population of Khodjaly,supported again by Russian armored tanks,when 613 peaceful civilians were crushed,shot and killed with cold steel,whose only guilt lay in their being Azerbaijanians.At the same time they did not spare pregnant women nor infants.Such is reality,Ms.Levinson.And if you wish to remain a slanderous opportunist and disseminator of vile disinformation,that is your right.If not,then can you find it possible to express regret and report on television that an error was made?.The correction of a mistake is not the worst thing in life.Felix Tsertisivadze,Bakuite THE "RUSSIAN MAFIYA IS ALIVE AND WELL.The Russian-speaking population of New York seems to think that the "Russian mafiya'" never existed.But believe it or not,the author has had run-ins with the "Russian mafiya" more than once.By the way,like many others,I didn't believe in its existence before then.But the mafiya made itself known in no uncertain terms.It all began on about February 24,when anchorman Ms.Marina Levinson of RTVI announced,to her multi-million member Rus-[29-30]sian-speaking audience on television that during the unrest (pogroms,upheavals,etc.)in Baku in 1990,250,000 Baku Armenians died.I am a Baku native.I experienced those events along with my fellow countrymen.In the pogrom manifested by the agonizing pro-Gorbachev regime on January 13-17 and 20-21,Baku Armenians were indeed killed.But it was not 250,000 who died-but 38.Besides,other residents of Baku died also:157 Azerbaijanians,6 Russians,3 Jews,2 Tatars and 2 Lezgins.Ms.Levinson's report may have been an accidental one,if it was not so carefully defended and if it did not do so much harm.This cynical bit of disinformation provided to the Russian-speaking taxpayers and consumers of the station's programming were mostly citizens of the USA.Let us assume that no one likes the Azerbaijanians.But what about the Russian,Jewish,Tatar and Lezgin victims? And there's more.It should not be forgotten that the death toll of Baku Armenians was increased 6,579-fold:from 38 to 250,000! Even in Baku's best periods,the Armenian population did not exceed 200,000,and at the time of the pogrom,by various accounts,it ranged from 10-15,000.All others had long ago fled this conflict-ridden region,selling their homes and apartments,packing their belongings into containers and closing their savings accounts.So Ms.Levinson lied in any event.Two hundred and fifty thousand Armenians could not have died in Baku in 1990,simply because they were not there.Now let us look further at this inadvertent report of Ms.Levinson.After I heard the monstrous lie uttered by this woman,I immediately called RTVI at (877)847-6688.A man by the name of Alexander answered the phone.Hearing the reason for my call,he informed me that many others in the viewing audience had already called them.He took my home number and promised that the error would be corrected,and that I would be called and told of the measures taken.A great deal of time passed.No one phoned me,no one expressed regret for nor made corrections to the cynical lie that was broadcast on the air.Then I wrote my own correction (a copy is enclosed herewith)and addressed it to the Russian-language newspapers for publication.But no one did! [30-31] Mr.D.Gai (of Russkaya reklama,or "Russian Advertising")told me that Ms.Levinson was not to blame,that it was accidental.Also,that my response was one-sided.That he,D.Gai,knows both sides of the matter and he would not publish my objection.Mr.V Vainberg (of Novoye russkoye slovo,or "New Russian Word"),did not agree to see me and through his secretary,Yana,(646)218-6900,stated that my correction was roughly-worded;"Oh,to think!." he said,"Ms.Levinson misspoke,who never has?" Messrs.M.Gusev and E.Pariyan (V novom svete,or "In the New World")responded in the manner of the unforgettable Frunzik Mkrtychian in the movie "Mimino":"Who is this Levinson? Where does she work? Actually,we don't even read the Russian press," In short,they played the fool.(And yet-what is the language of the publication they edit? Vietnamese,maybe?)They read my objection but refused to publish it.Ms.N.Shekinskaya (Vechernii Nyu-York,or "New York Evening" )was the sharpest one."I had heard about it," she answered,"Why didn't you call me right away on the air [besides the newspaper she edits,she is a television reporter and a producer of a series of programs],bring me the article,we'll publish it." But she didn't print it,and stopped responding to my calls to both publications.20 The circle,as they say,closed.And this isn't a "Russian mafiya "? A television station tells a bald-faced lie,and other members of the media cover it up.Doesn't this look like a conspiracy? "Coincidence," my opponents say.Maybe.But it was on or about 1996 when Whether or not this is a coincidence,nothing was done! Levinson lied,and Gai,Vainberg,Gusev,Pariyan and Shchekinskaya,knowing that their readers were lied to and deceived,said nothing,and reported nothing about this to their audiences.These people have apparently forgotten that they work not in the Russian,but in the American mass media,in the USA,where the laws and Constitution are mandatory for everyone,irrespective of their biases and sympathies.RTVI,generally speaking,persistently pushes through into the American market materials of questionable nature.For example,a television journalist of that station,a certain Stupnikov,reporting on the Armenian faith from Jerusalem on July 4,2004,essentially intervened in the internal politics of the USA and the activities of [31-32] the US Government He uttered some unethical words in a mocking tone,saying,in effect,Where is the famous American democracy if the USA has not yet recognized the genocide of Armenians in 1915? This can be construed as pressure on the US government.Especially since Mr.Stupnikov crafted his report very non-objectively,promoting the Armenian side as being a peaceful victim.If he was to speak of genocide,it would have been good for Mr.Stupnikov to know that it was the Armenians living in Armenia themselves who wrought ethnic cleansing and genocide against the Azerbaijanian population in 1988,destroying the peaceful and unarmed Azerbaijanian minority with every means possible:Azerbaijanians were killed in hospitals,burned alive,they were decapitated,drowned,crushed with vehicles,not to speak of shooting executions,hangings and fatal beatings.Solely for being Azerbaijanian.One begins to think that Levinson's and Stupnikov's reports are links in a single chain,and that someone is paying and training them well to promote a certain type of television programming.[32] Felix Tsertisivadze,Bakuite 21 AZERBAIJAN Compare Map A to Map E.Immediately noticeable is the sweep of the Armenian seizure of Azerbaijanian territory since the time of Tsar Nicholas I to the present day.22 23 24 THE HISTORICAL ASPECT Now let us try to figure out how the Armenian people,who always lived on the peninsula of Asia Minor (present-day Turkey),found themselves in the Trans-Caucasus.The overwhelming majority of people,when they hear the word 'Armenia" correspond today's Armenia with the ancient country of the same name.This is a mistake.Ancient Armenia has not existed for a very long time.Its territory,as fate would have it,was absorbed by Turkey,and its population scattered throughout the world.That is why Armenians living anywhere except Turkey are newcomers,and not rooted natives.Just as Armenians are new arrivals in France and Argentina,so are they newcomers in the Caucasus.The simplest,clearest and most convincing proof of this is that the Armenian language never entered into the group of Caucasian tongues.The peoples of the Caucasus did not speak Armenian because Armenians lived outside of the Caucasus region until the Russian Tsars invited them to occupy the lands conquered from Persia.Armenians began to live in the Caucasus in the last 150 years.The existence of Armenian schools and churches are no proof of the ancient presence of Armenians in any of the lands of the Caucasus,[33-34] for Armenian churches and schools are found all over the world as a result of the scattering of the Armenian nation,not only in the Caucasus but in Lebanon,Jerusalem.and America.But this gives them no right to say that Beirut,Jerusalem or New York belong to the Armenians.This also applies to any territory of the Caucasus.If an Armenian church is suddenly unearthed in the Caucasus that is older than 200 years,it eans it was either seized from or purchased earlier from the Georgians,or that it is a modified Muslim mosque which also may have been taken away with the aid of Russian arms during the Russo-Turkish or Russo-Persian wars.Or it was built from stones taken from ancient ruined Georgian churches or Muslim holy sites.Everything else.is from the evil one! Let us turn to the not-too-distant history.1723:St Petersburg:Russo-Iranian Treaty signed after the Persian Campaign of the Russian forces.Derbent,Baku,the Province of Gilian,Mazanderan,Astrabad went to Russia.Iran was offered Russian assistance in their struggle against the Afghans and Turks.1724:Istanbul.The Russo-Turkish agreement on the division of the holdings of Turkey and Russia in the Trans-Caucasus.Turkey recognized as Russian territories the latter received under the Russo-Iranian treaty of 1723.1735-1739:Russo-Turkish war over access to the Black Sea and to cut off attacks by Crimean Tatars.Russians took Azov,Ochakov,Khotin,Jassy and occupied Crimea.Ended with the Treaty of Belgrade of 1739 (B.K.Minikh).1768-1774:The Russo-Turkish War.Initiated by Turkey after Russian's refusal to withdraw its forces from Poland.Turkish forces are destroyed on land at Larga and Kagula,and the Turkish fleet defeated at the battle of Chesmen.Russians once again occupy Crimea.Ends with the Treaty of Kuchuk Kainardji (Rumiantsev,PA.).1787-1791:The Russo-Turkish War.Begun by Turkey to regain the Crimea.Russians defeat the Turks at Kinburn,Focsani,Rimnik,Izmayil.Admiral F.F.Ushakov destroyed the Turkish fleet at Kaliakria.Ended with the Yassi peace of 1792 (Suvorov,A.V).1804-1813:The Russo-Iranian War.Begun by Iran after the ultimatum to withdraw Russian forces from the Trans-Caucasus is rejected.Russian forces achieve a series of victories and occupied [34-35] the territory of all of northern Azerbaijan,including Karabakh and Nakhichevan.Ended with the Gulistan Peace of 1813.1806-1812:Russo-Turkish War.Begun by Turkey to recover former Black Sea coastal and Caucasus holdings.Victories by Russian forces and the diplomatic skill of M.I.Kutuzov led to the Treaty of Bucharest of 1812.1826-1828:Russo-Iranian War.Begun by Iran with the aim of returning Eastern Trans-Caucasus.Russian forces took Nakhichevan,Iravan,Tebriz.Ended with the Treaty of Turkmanchai of 1828.1828-1829:Russo-Turkish War.Russians took Kars and Erzerum in Turkey and defeated the Turks in Bulgaria.Ended with the Treaty of Adrianople in 1829.1877-78:Russo-Turkish War.Russians stormed the Turks at Shipka,at Pleven and once again took Kars in Turkey.Victories at Shenovo,Philippopolis,Adrianople concluded with the Treaty of San Stefano in 1878.1914:Russo-Turkish Agreement on Armenian autonomy in Turkey.Nullified due to World War I.1921:Turco-Soviet Treaty on friendship and fraternity.1925:Turco-Soviet Treaty on friendship and neutrality.In conjunction with the approach of Russian forces to the Trans-Caucasus,and finally,with their ultimate taking possession of it,the exodus of Armenians from Turkey and Persia into these lands grew.The decree of Emperor Nicholas I of Russia began this process.On the 11th day after the Treaty of Turkmanchai,he 25 set aside lands on the territory of the Iravan and Nakhchivan khanates for the formation of an 'Armenian oblast." And so it went.faster and faster.Now let us take a slight detour Imagine someone showing up and declaring that the American continent holds in its very name an Armenian root.But wasn't the continent named,we ask,in honor of Amerigo Vespucci? Nothing of the sort,comes the reply.There was no such person as Amerigo Vespucci.But there was a Turkish Armenian named Armenak Vespuchian who fled from the Turkish sword to Europe and adopting a euphonic Florentine name so that his intellectual endeavors and maritime voyages would not be hindered.Or another scenario.The New York isle of Manhattan is not Manhattan at all,but Mankhatakan,and the Armenians living there are the Mankhatakan people,descendants of ancient Armenians [35-36] who settled in America long before Christopher Columbus' ships (here's a hint:his real name is Khristik Ulubabyan!).What? You don't believe it? Look at southern Mankhatakan! Don't you see working Armenian churches? Now look at northern Mankhatakan.In what is now northern Harlem,do you see some ruins? These are the remains of ancient specimens of Armenian architecture.How do you think such information would be branded? Correct! As the delirium of an ailing imagination.But here in America,it is nonsense.But in Asia,or rather,in the Trans-Caucasus,such nonsense is exploited with all seriousness and laid down as the foundation of the aggressive expansion of the Armenian side.For instance,Karabakh was named Artsakh,the descendants of the Persian Armenians who reside there—the Artsakh people.And this "nation," in the warm embrace of united countries becomes the possessor of rights for self-governance and the right to form their very own government with the name of something like Artsakhakan.And no one is concerned that right next door,the Armenian people already have their own state,independent,sovereign Armenia.No! This nonsensical notion of creating a "greater Armenia" found its resonance,reborn now into greater nonsense of creating not one but two Armenian sovereign nations,two independent,bordering Armenian governments.Examining this absurdity under the light of international precedent,it turns out that Armenians stole the idea from the Palestinians.They also have their own state—Jordan.But no! Give them a state called Falastin.There is a common trait discernible here.They wish to create Falastin on Jewish lands,right here,next to Jordan.And Artsakhakan on Azerbaijanian lands,neighboring Armenia.Oh,come on,says the disinterested but educated bystander,but Azerbaijan already had territory taken from it for the present sovereign Armenia! First it was by Tsar Nicholas I,then another "tsar"—Josef Stalin,who granted the Armenians Zangezur.Where does it end? The most interesting thing is this:when the Russian two-headed eagle took the territory of Karabakh out from under the servile dependence of the Persian shah,no one but Azerbaijanians,subjects of the Karabakh khan,lived there.Not only were the self-naming and self-declaring 'Artsakhanians" not there,but neither were their ancestors,the Persian Armenians.[36-37] At the time,they didn't even imagine that they would live in Karabakh,they had not even packed their bags where they lived.Mr.I.E Paskevich,being the governor-general of the Caucasus,was not yet appointed to his post,had not yet summoned them from Persia and had not yet received the title of Count of Iravan to honor the Armenian resettlers.To confirm this I ask the reader to familiarize himself with the following document:TREATY OF MAY 14,1805 Signed by Khan Ibrahim of Karabakh and by the Russian Empire on the transfer of the khanate under the authority of Russia.I,Ibrahim-Khan of Shusha and Karabakh,in my own name,that of my heirs and successors,solemnly and forever refuse all vassalhood to or,under any other title,any dependency of Persia or any other sovereign nation and herewith declare before the entire world that I do not recognize above myself nor above my successors any other sovereignty than that of the supreme authority of His Imperial Highness of All-Russia,the great Tsar Emperor and His High heirs and successors of the throne of the All-Russian Empire,swearing to this throne my allegiance as a loyal servant thereof,in which I am obliged to give the customary oath on the Holy Qu'ran.IN THE NAME OF GOD ALMIGHTY We,that is Ibrahim-Khan of Shusha and Karabakh and Prince Pavel Tsitsianov,the Infantry General of the All-Russian troops,the Caucausian Infantry Inspector,etc,with the full power and authority given to me by His Highness the Emperor,the most-merciful Emperor Alexander Pavlovich,assuming with the help of God the matter of granting everlasting citizenship to the All-Russian Empire and the now-fortunately ruling great Tsar 26 Emperor Alexander Pavlovich and His high successors,of Ibrahim-Khan of Shusha and Karabakh with all his family,posterity and possessions of his; have concluded,established and executed the following articles:Article 1 I,Ibrahim-Khan Shushinsky,in my name,on behalf of my heirs and my successors,solemnly and forever abdicate any vassalage or whichever title it might bear,and any dependence from Persia or [37-38]any other sovereignty,and thus I declare before the whole world that I do not consider myself nor my successors as having any power,except by the Supreme Power of His Emperor's Highness of All Russia,the great Emperor and His high heirs and successors of the All-Russian Imperial Throne,promising loyalty to the throne as a faithful servant thereof,to which I am obliged to swear on Qu'ran in accordance with custom.Article 2 His Imperial Highness,accepting the openhearted promise of His Eminence,equally gives His word of honor and assurances through His Imperial word on his own behalf and that of his successors that Their favor and care will never cease for His Eminence Ibrahim-Khan Shushinsky and Karabahksky and his successors,as Their loyal subjects,in proof of which His Highness gives his Imperial guarantee for the preservation of the wholeness of the present properties of His Highness and his successors.Article 3 In repayment of the openheartedness with which His Eminence Ibrahim-Khan of Shusha and Karabakh recognizes the supreme and sole power of the All-Russian Emperor over himself and his successors,it is decreed that he,the aforementioned Khan and then his eldest son and each eldest successor,when accepting the khanate,is to receive Emperor's confirmation and investiture of the khanate from the Governor of Georgia; to be manifested in a certificate,bearing the official state seal,upon the receipt of which the new Khan is obliged to take the oath of loyalty to the Russian Empire and to recognize the supreme and sole power of the All-Russian Emperor over himself and his successors.The form of this oath is attached to this Treaty,so that the present Ibrahim-Khan of Shusha and Karabakh makes this oath in the presence of the Governor-General of Georgia and Infantry General,Prince Tsitsianov,who executed this decree.Article 4 I,Ibrahim-Khan of Shusha and Karabakh,in proof that my intentions in the judgment of the loyal subjection of myself and my successors to the All-Russian Empire and the recognition of the supreme and sole authority of the All-Luminous heads of that Empire,swear [38-39] to have no relations with surrounding leaders without the preliminary consent of the Governor-General of Georgia,and when emissaries or letters are received from them,that those of greater importance it is my duty to forward to the Governor-General and to request the his resolution of them,and those of lesser importance to report on and seek counsel of the Governor's representative.Article 5 His Imperial Highness graciously accepts the recognition of his supreme and sole power over the possessions of Ibrahim-Khan of Shusha and Karabakh and promises on behalf of himself and his successors:1)to deem the peoples of these possessions as his own loyal citizens without differentiating them from others inhabiting the vast Russian Empire.2)To preserve in perpetuity His Eminence Ibrahim-Khan,his house,heirs and posterity in the area of Shusha Khanate.3)To give all the power of internal governing,court and persecution,income and its possession to Ibrahim-Khan.4)In order to protect the person of His Eminence and his house and all his possessions to place in the Shusha fortress 500 All-Russian troops with cannons,headquarters and ober-officers and in case of the need for greater defense,the Governor of Georgia will be obliged,as circumstances and need dictate,to increase the number of troops due to circumstances to militarily defend the possessions of His Eminence was belonging to the All-Russian Empire.Article 6 I,Ibrahim-Khan Sushinsky and Karabakhinsky,as a symbol of my faithful diligence swear to:1)From the beginning and in the future to prepare for the aforementioned troops the needed amoung of wheat and corn at a reasonable price,established by the Governor-General,for delivering the same from Elisavetopol is deemed difficult or completely impossible.2)The aforementioned troops are to be provided with housing at the Shusha fortress,by the choice of the leader of the troops,and to provide them with needed firewood.3)Entrance to the Shusha fortress from the Elisavetopol side is to be accommodated and a road built for carriages.[39-40] 4)It would be convenient for the government to build a road from the Shusha fortress in the direction of Djevad,the workmen for this must be paid by me at the salary determined by the government.Article 7 27 His Emperor Highness showing his goodwill and kindness to His Eminence Ibrahim-Khan of Shusha and Karabakh kindly grants his coat of arms with the state emblem of the All-Russian Empire which is to be kept with him and subsequently by the ruling khan as a symbol of the khanate and the power Royally granted to him over these possessions,and if the need arises,no one is wage war with anyone except the khan himself.Article 8 I,Ibrahim-Khan Sushinsky and Karabakhinsky,having His Imperial Highness' permission to spend my usual revenues,commit to pay a contribution into the treasury of His Imperial Highness in Tiflis 8,000 gold coins annually,paying this sum in two installments,that is,February 1 the first half and September 1 the second half,beginning with the payment of the first half,that is,4,000 gold coins,upon confirmation of this treaty by HIH,and above that by Asiatic custom,I,in addition to the oath of loyalty,give as ransom the sone of my eldest son,Mamed-Hassanaga,the second Shukyur-Ullakh,for perpetual residence in Tiflis.Article 9 H.I.H.from his special kindness and all-mercifulness grants for the resident of Tiflis,as a sign of loyalty,to His Eminence's grandson,10 silver rubles a day.Article 10 This Treaty is concluded for perpetuity and is not to subject to any changes nor or ever.Article 11 This confirmation of this Treaty by His Imperial Highness with the deed bearing the state seal must be presented within 6 months after its signing or sooner if possible.[39-40] In confirmation of this,the undersigned executed these articles and applied their seals to them in the camp of the Elisavetopol region at the Kurak River,in the Year of Our Lord 1805 (Mohammedan year 1220),May (Safar)14." As is seen from this document,Russia conquered only Azerbaijainian lands.In these documents there is not one hint of Armenians or their possessions,nor of churches,nor any other traces of their presence in Shusha or Karabakh at the time of May 14,1805.So the mass settlement of Armenians in the Trans-Caucasus does not date from the times of Tigran the Great or Ashot the Iron-willed,but only from the 19th and 20th centuries.By the 20th century,it by and large ended.Only the resettlement of Armenian groups occurred within the Trans-Caucasus.The development of capitalism,the lack among the Georgians and Azerbaijanis of their own national bourgeoisie and the oil boom in Baku predicated the concentration of Armenians in Baku and Tbilisi,and the magnificent climatic conditions and sparsely-populated lands of Nagorno-Karabakh concentrated the Armenians there,too.Primarily these were exiles from Persia.Besides,the Armenians everywhere declared their devotion to Christianity,which also opened the path for them and gave them priority over the Azerbaijanians on the part of the Russian authorities.In actuality,they had doomed themselves for isolation within the Christian world,pretending to exclusivity in the area of Christian theology and finally breaking off from Orthodoxy,breaking into a "schism," for which the entire Christian world condemned the Armenian teachings at the Fifth Ecumenical Council in Chalcedon in 451,qualifying them as heresy,and the Armenians as heretics.Reality over the following fifteen centuries has shown that Armenians,expending no small effort to depict Muslims in an unattractive way to the rest of the world,themselves have not Christian,but Muslim roots (or at least roughly half of them).Consequently,a significant portion of the Armenian nation bears not a Christian but a Muslim mentality.Obvious proof of this are their Muslim surnames,to which they added the suffix "ian." There are many examples of this:Aganbe[41-42]gyan.Balayan,Karamian,Allakhverdyan,Melikian,Beglarian,Zargarian,Lalayan,Isakhanian,Agayan,Arzumanian,etc.Azerbaijanian words familiar to many peek out from their surnames:aga (master),kara (black),bek (ruling prince),bala (child),Allah (God),arzu (dream),verdi (granted),zargiar (jeweler),lal (mute one),khan (ruler),and so on and so forth.It is also worth noting that the juxtaposition of letters forming "ian" is in and of itself,having no Armenian basis,traces its possessor sooner to Chinese than Armenian sources.It is good that the Armenians did not assume 12 tribes,like,for example,the Israelis.Otherwise,paid "historians" would have been found who would prove that 2 billion Chinese people are a lost tribe of Armenia.But despite the surnames,the bulk of the Armenian population,saving themselves from persecution in Turkey and Persia,found a haven on Azerbaijanian territory,where they are allowed to live,sharing rights on par with the native population.No one resisted the Armenians on this land.They developed freely,bore children,reared them,taught them,built their churches,schools,published newspapers and books.28 Armenians were not hindered from occupying high posts,becoming businessmen,plying trades,working in academia and culture.So it was during tsarist times,before the October Revolution,and so it continued under the Soviets.Here is a far-from-complete list of Armenians who were born and raised in Azerbaijan,under the care and blessing of the Azerbaijanian people,who long ago ceased to consider the Armenians foreigners.Armenians in Azerbaijan were free rein.See for yourself,dear reader,who the Armenians became on the blessed Azerbaijanian land and pray tell,could they have existed,these Armenians,if the Azerbaijanians oppressed them?

Industrialists,merchants,tradesmen in small Georgian towns were mostly the heterodox Armenians from other cities." '.' Of special interest is the moment of the departure from Orthodoxy of the Armenians.[I]t arose and found its own dogmatic cavils only in the 4th century,when Armenians,in seeking to please the Persian King Chosroes,once and for all rejected the Chalcedon Council's formulation and adhered to the Monophysites.The Persians needed this to introduce division within the Christian world and weaken Byzantium." [45-46] '.' Seeing that all this compromises the Armenian Church in the eyes of the Orthodox,in the 13th century,the Armenian historian Kirakos,and later the Catholicoses Iosif and Nerses,tried to conceal the Armenians' monophysitism." '.' A satirist of an Armenian newspaper gave Christ the words of Judas.After this,the expression 'Judas' morality' became common inTiflis." '.' It is easy to imagine how unceremoniously Armenians behave towards other peoples.A few years ago in the Kakhetin city of Signakhi,Orthodox Christians were celebrating the Epiphany.Specifically in order to mock the Orthodox,the Armenian lounge-suit intellectuals hired an intolerably screechy zurna [Oriental wind instrument] and drum,climbed a nearby bell tower and raised such an unimaginable racket that one could not hear the prayers of the divine service." '.' Mistakes made by the Armenian ecclesio-theocratic politicians had,and remain to have to this day,extremely dangerous consequences for the Armenian people themselves." '.' The sad history of the Armenian people had as its result a significant mixing of religious aims of the church with all sorts of worldly matters.This harms the spiritual development of the Armenians,and,in sum,even the moral prestige of the Catholicos himself and other hierarchs." '.' What Armenians mean by 'resisting' is well-understood by the residents of the doomed Russian town in Terter,of the Elisavetople (Giandja)guberniya.The tale of one of the surviving refugees made such an impression on his listeners that all the horrors of the Turkish slaughter pale before the cold,Satanic cruelty of the 'peaceful' and 'cultured' Armenians in driving the Russians out of territory gained with Russian blood.The aforementioned politicos wish to drive out (eliminate)also the Muslim population of the area and ruin the reputation of Muslims,so that they could use their lands in the future." [46-47] '.' In many cities of the Trans-Caucasus,Muslims comprise the overwhelming majority of the population,and at the same time,they do not enjoy municipal self-governance with rights on par with the Armenians on the basis of the fact that the latter are 'Christians.' Christianity without Christian morals is a farce,and it is for good reason that one Orthodox bishop who knows life in the Caucasus once told me [that is,Velichko],that he considers Muslims (that is.the Azerbaijanians)in spirit and moral foundation closer to Ortho-dox Christianity than the Armenian monophysites." '.' On August 13,1903,at 7 o'clock in the evening in the city of Aleksandrople (Leninakan),the Orthodox Protopriest Vasilov was killed in the street with a dagger; he was the object of dissatisfaction by an Armenian revolutionary committee for converting 3 Armenian villages to Orthodoxy.'.' The role of specifically Turkish Armenians,worthy graduates of the Turkish 'school' and by descent half-Kurdish,is persuasively put forth as the transgressors both in this instance and in a multitude of other crimes." '.' If besides the word 'fabrication,' one needed to inscribe in the history books of Armenia another word which would precisely characterize indisputable facts,one could not escape using the word 'betrayal'.The rulers of Armenia,a country with constantly-shifting borders,always depended on the powerful neighboring monarchies and always,systematically,betrayed them.Noblemen (nakharari)betray the tsars,the people betray both.The brutality of their ethos and unreliability of mutual relations are phenomenal.In Armenia itself,a somewhat independent monarchy was eliminated so long ago,in the fifth century,that when the country became a Persian province,theocracy took the reins,led by the Catholicos.Some semblance of statehood appeared at the end of the 11th century.and finally fell apart in 1375." ".The Armenians have the ability to assimilate externally,to assume foreign names,garb and traditions.In Georgia,the majority of Armenians assumed surnames ending in "shvili." In Muslim [47-48] provinces,the names ‘Iusuf-bek,' 'Kara-bek,' 'Ibragim-khan and others appeared for the concealment of Armenians." 31 ".Assimilation,as it turned out,was very superficial and temporary.Armenianism secreted a 'stone of identity’.And this stone grew in size,at first unnoticeably,but by the second half of the 19th century,it grew at a glaring,head-spinning pace." ".An important person of high rank might still be able to defend Russian interests from Armenian efforts.But it is simply unsafe for a minor clerk to be an honest servant of the state without allowing the disorder and abuses perpetrated by the Armenian big shots.He will without fail be deceived,besmirched,forced out in one way or another,unless he has strong support.They would try to influence his wife or children,buy his promissory notes and destroy his credit." ".Without a doubt,the Turkish atrocities were horrifying.But doubtless the Anglo-Armenian press,along with the cosmopolitan press worldwide,greatly inflated the dimensions of this terrible plight of the people,adding zeroes to the tens and hundreds of actual victims." ".A greater tragedy lies in the fact that to a significant degree,wealthy Armenians themselves,spiritual figures and other politicos betrayed a portion of their lesser brethren to doom and persecution." ".During the last slaughter in Turkey (1896),incurred by the activities of the revolutionaries,the Russian Government suggested to the patriarch (Catholicos Mkrtich I)that he issue a sobering statement,but he,quite to the contrary,began to make inflammatory sermons." ".As sorts of Mantashevs,Aramiantses,Arafelovs,Markariantses and other Armenians bosses buy lands out for pennies and populate them with exiles from Turkey.Chapels and even churches are handed over to the Armenians." [48-49] ".From the numerous examples of such disgraceful facts we cite two instances which occurred over the course of two months."Kavkaz," 1987.June.The parishioners of the Church of St Nicholas in Dushet made a decision wherein two of them were directed to intercede before the higher Caucasus leadership to take measures against the seizure by Armenians clergymen of a chapel named 'Bodavis-tsminda Georgis-nisha' with its parcel of property a half a verst from the city of Dushet.Ancient icons from the chapel,in the words of the collaborators,were long ago stolen and brought to an Armenian church in Dushet.The parcel was transferred to this church 'in an unknown way' on May 15 last,while the chapel itself was renamed 'Surp-Geurkov" and its Orthodox priests were barred from entering it to serve." ".‘Iveria,’ April 1897.The city of Akhaltsikh.Near the city,on the opposite banks of the river Potskhova,there is a wellspring with powers to heal headaches.Near the source from time immemorial stood a Georgian chapel and a small hut.The healing powers of this spring were known to all,and the ailing from all over Georgia gathered here for relief.There was no fee for using the water,but voluntary contributions in no small amounts were collected by the chapel.At the beginning of March of last year,someone decided to put up Armenian icons in the chapel,attach doors to it,lock them and take the keys.The local dean,Priest D.Khakhutov,reported on this to the Georgian Exarch." ".Under I.F.Pasekevich (1827-1830),a certain Colonel Lazerev was sent to Persia to invite Armenians,who came to the Trans-Caucasus by a count of some 40,000 souls.The Patriarch of Echmiadzin also participated in this scheme,ordering Armenian priests to leave Persia,who were followed by their flock.By the Treaty of Adrianople,we got over 100,000 Turkish Armenians.Archbishop Karapet of Erzerum alone brought approximately 70,000 people." ".From this time on (1829),the gradual exodus of Armenians from Muslim states (Turkey and Persia)to Russia continued unabated.Now when it has become clear what the results were of the effort of the Caucasian administrators in attracting as many [49-50] Armenians as possible,it is worth remembering a saying from Little Russia:'to buy one's sorrow with one's own money.'" ".Each war between Russia and her neighboring Eastern states increased the number of Armenians (in the Trans-Caucasus)." ".It is worth noting that the Armenian patrons from among the oil producers are making a great effort to invent an utterly discrete history of Armenia.This includes taking every opportunity to promote their own historical 'contributions' and their present-day value through parasitic means,that is,casting aspersions on their neighboring peoples,whose history was more clear,undoubted and respectable.They steal unconscionably from the Georgians in the historical-geographical area:they scrape Georgian inscriptions from monuments,seize ancient Orthodox chapels and abandoned churches.They compose historical absurdities and refer to ancient Armenian holdings in regions where every stone speaks of the ancient Georgian monarchy.For example,they try to kidnap the historical Georgian right to the Saatab region,the holdings of Atabek Djakeli,the present-day Akhaltsikh uezd." ".Armenian politicians and 'historical activists' tried to corrupt the French scholar de Bailie.By the way,he visited Echmiadzin,the seat of the Armenian Catholicos,where he was shown some ancient chalices,crowns,embroidered cloth,etc.The experienced archeologist immediately noticed the inaccuracy of the chronological facts presented by the Armenians and commented on them in print,not without some humor.It turned out that the so-called ancient designs were actually from the late rococo." 32 ".Contrary to oral tradition regarding the Cathedral of Echmiadzin of the 4th century,Baron de Bailie,judging from archeological evidence,considers it a church of the 15th century and finds that the wall inscriptions reflects Persian art." ".This is not to speak of the clumsiest textbooks (in the Armenian church schools of the time)which described the alleged great Armenia and the global calling of Armenians to civilize their [50-51]neighbors.Maps of great Armenia were distributed in these schools,stretching almost to Voronezh,with its capital in Tiflis." ".The bulk of the Armenian population probably thought about autonomy in Turkey and Persia.But moving inside the borders of the might Russia,and specifically to the Trans-Caucasus.the Armenian people at first did not fall prey to these ill-advised dreams." ".After the Treaty of Berlin,the Armenians began to dream about political independence.But in order to have real,solid autonomy,and not parasitic autonomy,one needs some measure of real territory.As documents from the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs published in 1897 have shown,the prerequisites for this did not exist in Turkey.The first page states:An exhaustive study of the distribution of various tribes gives reason to deduce that the Armenians do not represent a majority in even one vilayat of the Turkish Empire." ".Mr.Cambon enumerates a whole series of vicious political slayings committed by members of the Armenians revolutionary committee and their thugs.and notes a very characteristic trait that the majority of Armenians do not sympathize with the revolution and only isolated clumps of Turkish Armenians are gradually succumbing to the threats and terror of their leaders,and some of them unwillingly enter the fray.May Turkish Armenian refugees with whom either I (Velichko)or my friends have spoken,openly admit that they fled to Russia not from the Turks but from their own terrorists." ".The book mentioned above (of Mr.Cambon)speaks of mass unrest sparked by the Armenians,who in some places began to attack Turks and Kurds in order to ignite slaughter.At first.the outrageous brutality in Constantinople (Istanbul),where,as everyone knows,a band of Armenians detonated bombs in the "Ottoman Bank," the Armenian Revolutionary Committee appealed to Mr.Cambon directly with a note saying that Armenians have decided to conduct a 'peaceful demonstration' and that the Committee,it said,could not answer for its actions if the police steps in.During [51-52] the following manifestations,Armenians began killing police officers first and even gendarmes,which set off the horrible slaughter of Armenians." For many people who hear the words 'Azerbaijan" and 'Azerbaijanians" with suspicion,the words of Mr V.L.Velichko above could be a revelation.It is very possible that they could also be surprising for certain parts of Armenian society who see their history from a very tendentiously nationalistic viewpoint,for whom anything 'Armenian" whether it is "good" or "bad" is only understood as being either "correct" and "exempt from condemnation." One is alarmed at the undisguised,open succession of dangerous tendencies within the self-identification of,if not the entire Armenian nation—because it is scattered and diverse —then at least the most influential portion of it.We are speaking first and foremost of the following aspects:Armenians,without hesitation,with the aim of achieving the goals they set for themselves,goals they deem the only right ones,willingly sacrifice a part of their population.At the same time,the Armenian population itself,sacrificed to the ambitions of their leaders and the goals of those who stood at the helm of Armenian politics,know nothing of this.The people are not informed of this,and their opinion is simply ignored.These people are intentionally,premeditatedly placed in harm's way of the counteractions taken by those who are instigated by the Armenian leaders in every slice of their history,so that the Armenian propaganda apparatus,notified and prepared in advance,would trumpet to the whole world the next series of anti-Armenian pogroms and anti-Armenian repressions.Such is the bloody and inhuman method employed by the Armenian propaganda machine in maintaining the myth within world consciousness of the long-suffering Armenian nation,set against the background of other peoples,whom the Armenians,in one leap,overshot and deferred to the ranks of the "little-suffering." World society has no idea about any of this,or it pretends that it does not,that the "pogroms" and "repressions" of the Armenians are prepared and provoked by the Armenian side itself.You have seen examples of the aforementioned irresponsible provocations of the Armenian side which led to the slaughter of Armenians in 1896 in Istanbul which then spilled out into the provinces.[52-53] But the Armenians behaved in an identical manner in February 1988,and in January 1990,and many times before and after this.Here we draw attention to these dates because they caused greater resonance throughout the world.Few know that the detonator of the Sumgait pogrom was the shooting by Armenians of unarmed and helpless Azerbaijanian youths,practically children,not far from Askeran.There were two killed and 19 injured.33 One of the fuses lit by Gorbachev's Special Forces in their aim of organizing an anti-Armenian pogrom in Baku was the assault by Armenian soldiers on the Azerbaijanian town of Gushchu of the Khanlar region and the execution of several dozen residents of this village.As we can see from the facts brought forth by V.L.Velichko,Armenians did not hesitate to kill ethnic Russians and even Russian clergymen and at the same time declared even to this day their unificationist strivings with the Russian side.May these lines become a source of food for thought for those powers in Russia which have become blinded by the proponents of Armenian politics.In general,while reading Velichko's book,one gets the feeling that the author is describing our era,and not events of 100 years ago,they are so familiar and similar.There is also a complementary,independent and unbiased resource confirming that the resettlement of the Armenian population from Persia and Turkey to the land of the Azerbaijanians in Azerbaijan began only after the Treaty of Gulistan (1813)and the Treaty of Turkmanchai (1828)with Persia.Before this,there were no Armenians living in Azerbaijan.In order to further hide and deny this fact,the Armenians seized churches belonging to others,monuments of antiquity,removed ancient inscriptions upon them,frescoes,replacing them with Armenian letters and inscriptions.At the same time they tried at every step to conceal their monophysit-ism (they even claim the Holy Sepulcher of the Lord in Jerusalem,but this is beside the point),and the fact that the Christian world deemed them apostates and heretics.This remains the Armenian policy with far-reaching goals.The bitter fruits of this policy are left for today's Azerbaijanians.[53] 34 THE CONSPIRACY AGAINST THE AZERBAIJANIAN PEOPLE Anyone can understand that under totalitarian conditions,where the General Secretary or President concentrated in his hands the entirety of power,nothing can occur without his knowledge.No matter how the Soviet Union tried to mask itself as "socialism with a human face" in 1987,this was a totalitarian state and Mikhail Gorbachev was its omnipotent monarch.That is why,without his knowledge and consent,123,000 Karabakh Armenians not only could never have decided to take action against 8 million Azerbaijanians,but they would not dare make a peep.Even if the neighboring 3-million-strong Armenia promised its support.Here it is worth noting that the Armenians are divided even among themselves.In Armenia,Karabakh Armenians were hated and despised.Residents of Karabakh did not travel to Yerevan unless absolutely necessary.All the fairy tales of broken ties and fervent love are bald-faced lies.Armenians from Nagorno-Karabakh in Yerevan and in other cities of Armenia were the butt of jokes and mockery.They were called "half-baked" and were constantly berated for being unable to speak proper Armenian.[54-55] Armenians of Yerevan loved to say that Nagorno-Karabakh is inhabited by thoroughbred jackasses,but was devoid of humans.Complaints by the Armenians of NK against the inappropriate attitude towards them in Yerevan were a common enough thing and known to everyone living in Baku.The Armenians of Karabakh re-paid this debt with the very same coin,so to speak.In the NKAR,many insulting jokes made the rounds about the Yerevan Armenians."Once in Baku some friends asked Mantashev why he had no decent property in Yerevan.Mantashev replied:I earn money in Baku,drink it away in Tbilisi,and empty my bowels in Yerevan.So all I need there is one toilet." The point needs no clarification.But let us return to the Armenian-Armenian relations.For the sake of objectivity,it is worth noting that the Armenian tongue spoken in the 1970's and 1980's was heavily salted with Russian words.They laughed at themselves,at phrases like "magazina pesoka ekala." By which one meant (in Russian)"v magazin zavezli sakharniy pesok" ["granular sugar was brought to the store"].Such phrases are not unusual.For sugar,butter and meat were sold to the population of the USSR by coupon,and the appearance of granular sugar in a grocery store was quite an event.Regarding the most important Armenian in Nagorno-Karabakh,the Secretary of Public Communications,B.Kevorkov,this was a joke in and of itself:Kevorkov spoke absolutely no Armenian,not a word,not a half a word.When he received Armenian visitors,an interpreter always stood beside him,who would translate Armenian for this "leading" Armenian.You can see for yourselves,dear readers,that no fraternal love between Armenians could even have existed.Yerevan Armenians and Karabakh Armenians were not drawn together but repelled by each other.This refutes yet another stereotype ascribed by Armenian propaganda to the rest of the word—that of all-Armenian love.One can summon up other examples of how Armenians "love" Armenians.For instance:During the Sumgait pogrom,which erupted after the shooting by Armenians of the Azerbaijanian youth,many criminal elements were noticed who had committed the worst atrocities.These were arrested,and their nationalities formed a sort of tossed salad.That is,among those committing the pogrom,who looted and burned Armenian [55-56] apartments,they discovered,among others,ethnic Armenians,the most active of whom was a certain Eduard Grigoryan.This bandit personally murdered four Armenians of Sumgait.Where he ended up with his cohorts,you would have to ask the globe-trotting "peacemaker" Gorbachev.All of the murderers arrested,along with hundreds of tomes of criminal indictments were exported from Azerbaijan into Russia upon his orders,and their traces disappeared there.Here is another example of Armenian "love:" On July 14,1990,in Stepanakert,a house on Martuni street was blown up,having belonged to G.Sartarian.His son suffered serious injuries,and his wife,an employee of the local airport,was killed.For what? Because Sartarian's chauffeur was transporting military uniforms,thereby fulfilling patrol service in Stepanakert.Armenian militants blew him up in the course of "Operation Black Ring." Soon thereafter they killed the resident of Stepanakert,V.Grigorian,who dared to meet with a representative of Azerbaijanian society in order to develop a concordance on working out a resolution in the Armenian-Azerbaijanian relations that had developed during that period.Moreover,Grigorian was killed blatantly,cynically,in the light of day,and the perpetrator,who killed him with a burst from an automatic weapon,did not even think of hiding.He calmly walked away from the crime scene.The street was filled with people.These people,Armenians,not only did not detain the killer,but they did not even approach Grigorian,who was lying in a pool of blood and did not even try to help the poor man.In seeking a peaceful resolution to the Armenian-Azerbaijanian conflict,the extremist part of Armenian society sentences to death not only rank-and-file Armenians.The Prime Minister of Armenia,Vazgen Sarkisian and the Speaker of Parliament,Karen Demirchian,who tragically died as a result of an organized attack on their 35 lives right in the Armenian Parliament building.Together with them,a few other members of this supreme body of the state of Armenia died.In the lobbies of Armenian culture is the tendency of blaming their deaths on R.Kocharian.Why? Because before,the Azerbaijanians were guilty of all Armenian sorrows.But there are none in Yerevan.So someone from among the Karabakh Armenians must be blamed.Especially since one of them had reached such heights that he can be seen from all around.Yet I do not sympathize at all [56-57] with the former field commander,who,no matter how he tries,has still been unable to wash himself clean of Azerbaijanian blood.Both then and now,when the word "conspiracy" is heard,many of my opponents groan skeptically:"What are you talking about? This cannot be" and so on.But when among many thousands of facts confirming the existence of a conspiracy against the Azerbaijanian people,I suggest that these skeptics comment upon only the two I present below,as a rule,they hurry to change the subject or,referring to urgent matters,end the conversation and leave.Here are the facts:Fact Number One.On December 7,1988,a strong earthquake shook Armenia.Tens of thousands died.Help for the victims rushed in from all parts of the country; back then it was still the Soviet Union.On December 11,1988,an IL-76 aircraft with lifesavers on board crashed near the Armenian town of Spitak,because of a malfunctioning altimeter.Seventy-two persons died.On December 12,a similar IL-76 with 77 volunteers from Azerbaijan crashed near Gukark,but not for technical failure,but as a result of a terrorist act; the firing of a "Stinger" ground-to-air missile.Only E Badaev,a resident of Baku,miraculously survived.-Where did Armenian militants obtain a heat-seeking rocket?-Who sold or gave it to them,and taught them to fire it?-Is this a coincidence,that in the heat of ethnic cleansing of the Azerbaijanian population of Armenia,which did not cease even after a terrible earthquake,the Azerbaijanians still organized and delivered a team of volunteers to their suffering neighbors,despite the fact that these very same neighbors killed Azerbaijanians by the dozen,ejecting them from the territory of Armenia?-Wasn't the airplane filled with Azerbaijanians near Gukarka a link in the chain of ethnic cleansing being committed in this very same Gukarka and spreading throughout the entire territory of Armenia? Fact Number Two.On November 20,1991,another heat-seeking rocket,again launched from Armenian positions,struck an MI-8 helicopter at the town of Garakend.Killed along with the crew were the Gen-[57-58]eral Secretary of Azerbaijan,Tofik Ismailov,together with his companions,Minister of Internal Affairs of Azerbaijan,Mohammed Asadov,the Attorney General of Azerbaijan,Ismet Gaibov,the Presidential Press Secretary Osman Mirzoev,senior military commanders and many other civil and military persons.-How did they all end up together?-Where were the escort helicopters and defensive support?-How did the Armenian militants come to know the route and schedule of the military helicopter?-Who destroyed the tape contained within the "black box" of the downed helicopter,taken long before the rescue team and Special Forces arrived? But I digress.It is necessary,at a minimum,to have a conspiracy of two sides against a third.We have all this and more.Two of the conspirators —Gorbachev and the Armenian side against a third— Azerbaijan.Unfortunately,the Armenians did not understand then,and do not understand now,that this is a road to nowhere.The false euphoria glazed their eyes and darkened their minds.For the territories of Lachin,Kelbadjar,Kubatlin,Fizulin,Agdam,Djebrail,Zangelan and other areas of Azerbaijan would have to be returned.And from Khankyandi (what they call Stepanakert):Shusha,Askeran,Gadruta,Martuni would be ceded.Because those who do not leave would have to recognize the sovereignty of Azerbaijan.You don't believe it? I will stray for a moment and provide an example.Many years ago in Baku,there was a joke about Jews,about who they are comprised of.As the joke goes,Jews are comprised of two groups:those who already left and those who thought they wouldn't.That is about the same situation in Nagorno-Karabakh.Those who are older know that that which was stolen would have to be returned.Those who think in a younger way think that this can be avoided.Back to the conspiracy.The aim of Gorbachev in the first phase was to pit the Azerbaijanians and Armenians against each other,then the Azerbaijanians against the Russians,and if it succeeds,in the third phase to pit them against the Georgians.We will probably never know where and when this conspiracy was cooked 36 up,unless Gorbachev is questioned in an international court and he gives an honest answer.But the fact that the conspiracy was in-[58-59] tensively followed by both sides is proven by a mass of direct and indirect proof.Gorbachev's motivation was to maintain the power of the Communist Party and to remain at its helm for as long as possible.The motivation for the Armenians was the manifestation of the age-old dream of having a "greater Armenia" by annexing Azerbaijanian,Georgian and Russian lands.Incidentally,Mr Zhirinovsky,who smears everyone and everything in the Caucasus,except,of course,the Armenians,should know that the northern border of the ostensible "greater Armenia" traces the southern borders of Voronezh.But that's beside the point.Returning to the evidence of a conspiracy.Armenian writers and the press were given,by Gorbachev,through his power structures,more than conducive conditions for slanderous and provocative activity against Azerbaijan.And so Z.Balayan,People's Deputy of the USSR,published the books 'Accident," "Wings," "Breeding Ground" and others,infused with hatred for everything Azerbaijanian.Azerbaijanians were called "Turks," "Tatars," at every step of the way stressing disdain for this nation.Gorbachev did the same,but in another way.He cunningly distorted the word 'Azerbaijanians," calling them 'Azebirjanians." That is,he poured kerosene on the fire.Besides the aforementioned Balayan and his contributions,many others began to qualify the Azerbaijanians as nothing more than "a group of nomad arrivals," "barbarians," "vandals," "fosterlings of neofascism." Despite the out-and-out nationalistic intent of the declarations and scrawlings of Balayan,not only did he not incur condemnation on the part of the powers that be in the USSR under Gorbachev,but was protected in every way.Gorbachev demonstratively and repeatedly received in his cabinet,in the presence of other members of the Politburo,including A.Yakovlev,Balayan,S.Kaputikian and many other Armenian activists who inflamed the hatred of the Armenians for the Azerbaijanians,calling for the expulsion of Azerbaijanians form Nagorno-Karabakh and Armenia.Gorbachev had long friendly conversations with Z.Balayan and S.Kaputikian and used terminology in these meetings that were adopted by the Armenians.For instance,Nagorno-Karabakh he called 'Artsakh." Inspired by the support and protection of Gorbachev,Silva Ka-putikian,speaking at a regular meeting in Yerevan,called for anti-Azerbaijanian pogroms and other unlawful actions.She declared,in part:"We are prepared for any sacrifices in the name of Artsakh!" [59-60] The provocative challenges were joined by Armenian figures of authority.For example,by Ambartsumian.During meetings at Teatralny Square in Yerevan,he put forth the slogan:'Armenia without Turks!" (read 'Armenia without Azerbaijanians!").Not wishing to be left behind,the academic R.Kazarian declared:"For the first time in many years,Gorbachev has given us the opportunity to cleanse Armenia of Azerbaijanians!" As you can see,the Armenian side was no longer bashful.Gorbachev's bonds with the Armenians and their participation in the joint con-spiracy against the Azerbaijanians was not only not hidden,it was not even disguised.On the contrary,these conspiratorial connections were emphasized,and even abroad.So the scholar A.Aganbegyan,who was especially close to Gorbachev as his economic advisor,said in an interview to the French newspaper Humanite that 'As an economist,I feel that Nagorno-Karabakh has closer ties to Armenia that Azerbaijan.In this area I made a certain proposal." He went on with the hint that the matter was already discussed "at the top" and found Gorbachev's support."I hope," continued Aganbegyan,"that in the conditions of perestroika this problem will be resolved." Where is this "specialist" in such wide-ranging matters now? In February 1999,a news item flashed in which Abel Aganbegyan was criminally indicted for abuse of his position.It is time to employ similar methods against his former chief.In addition,Gorbachev decided to repay the Armenians who had engaged him and conclusively cleared the road for the Armenians,removing from the political scene the decisive and powerful leader of Azerbaijan,Geidar Aliyev,who under Andropov became a member of the Politburo and the Deputy Chairman of the Soviet of Ministries of the USSR.Gorbachev knew that if any levers of power remained in the hands of Aliyev,that he would not permit Armenian expansion.The fact of the matter is that the Armenians of Nagorno-Karabakh somehow tried to test how solidly Aliyev held his power.In 1969,in Stepanakert,they started a rebellion,having first,as usual,[60-61] arranged a bloody provocation.They falsely accused an Azerbaijanian teacher in the murder of an Armenian child; when the accused and three of his co-villagers were brought to the courtyard of the Stepanakert courts,Armenians overturned the car containing the four Azerbaijanians,poured gas over it and burned all four alive.Pogroms then started,and armed demonstrations.Aliyev quickly and decisively crushed the illegal Armenian actions,which were aimed at the destabilization of the region and sought the annexation of Nagorno-Karabakh to Armenia.37 The Armenian and Soviet press,obedient to the instructions of Gorbachev,Ligachev,Yakovlev and other members of the Politburo of the Communist Party after the retirement of Aliyev,unleashed a real fox-hunt after him.On February 11,1988,V Mikhailov,Head of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (clearly with the knowledge and instructions of Gorbachev),received a delegation from Nagorno-Karabakh consisting of 9 persons.The delegates had only one question:"Is it possible to separate NKAR from Azerbaijan? Mikhailov's reply was succinct:"Go home and act!" Gorbachev did not shy away from exploiting for prevocational aims the members of the Politburo under him.Yegor Ligachov came to Baku and said that Moscow recognizes the need for the decisive rejection of Armenian claims to Azerbaijan territory.Ligachev convinced the Azerbaijanian side that Moscow under no circumstances would allow the violation of the territorial integrity of Azerbaijan.At the same time,the chief ideologue of the CPSU,who later became the most democratic democrat,Alexander Yakovlev,traveled to Yerevan and convinced the Armenian side that right is on their side,that Moscow is with them and that they will definitely be victorious.The Armenian press and the media controlled by them published articles on the 'Andronik's Mauserists." The mob led by this "general" in 1918 destroyed tens of Azerbaijanian villages in Karabakh and Zangezur together with their populations.This Andronik was glorified in Armenia as the epitome of morality,strength and nobility.[61-62] Many representatives of the cultural intelligentsia of Armenia also spoke out with proclamations provoking the ouster of Azerbaijanians from Armenia and Nagorno-Karabakh.Provocations.Anti-Azerbaijanian and anti-Muslim psychosis.But the central power in Moscow— Gorbachev—pretends that nothing is happening.Provocateurs and instigators are not called onto the carpet.But of course,who would be summoned,if these provocateurs and instigators were members of the Politburo head-ed by Gorbachev himself? The fact that the actions aimed towards tearing Nagorno-Karabakh from Azerbaijan violated international rules of law stopped no one.The principle of the inviolability of borders between governments was confirmed at the Potsdam Peace Conference in 1945,ratified by the Final Act at the Helsinki Conference on Security and Co-operation,later by the Madrid Conference and the Paris Charter of 1991.Emboldened by the support of the central government headed by Gorbachev,the Armenians,finding no resistance on the part of the Special Forces under Gorbachev,nor the KGB,the Ministry of Internal Affairs,domestic military forces and the Department of Defense,mobilized.An Armenian National Army was created (ANA).Its divisions commenced committing terrorist acts against those guarding Azerbaijanian towns.From January to April 1990,over 100 attacks were made against townspeople,which included weapon fire aimed at their homes.Many hostages were taken,Azerbaijan towns were sacked.Cattle were driven away by the tens of thousands.Everywhere were dead and injured unarmed Azerbaijanian peasants and shepherds.The Soviet information channels under Gorbachev remained silent on all this.Silent,too,were the Deputies of the Supreme Council of the USSR.But who would say anything anyway? Maybe a Deputy,like G.Starovoitofa? But she was the one who headed the group of Deputies of the Supreme Council engaged by the Armenian side and besmirched the Azerbaijanians.Her personal hobby was to describe in every way possible the tragedy in Sumgait.Yet this activist (now deceased)was utterly silent on the subject of the ambush shooting by Armenians of unarmed Azerbaijanian youths,on the genocide in Gukarka,where again [62-63]the Armenian side murdered 33 helpless peaceful Azerbaijanian citizens.Starovoitova was mute,as were her fellow deputies,following the ethnic cleansings of the Azerbaijanian population in Armenia.Everything was done to conceal this genocide against the Azerbaijanians,to prevent this information from finding its way to newspapers or television.[63] 38 THE BEASTLY VISAGE OF GENOCIDE The Armenian side reminds the world at every turn of the brutality of the Turks in 1915.But how are the Armenians of 1988 different from the Turks of 1915? They are not.Armenians supersede them in cruelty and barbarity.Here are the concrete facts:The murders in Gukarka acted as a signal for thorough ethnic cleansing all over Armenia.By the way,these pogroms and expulsions of Azerbaijanians from their homes in December of 1988 and January of 1989 were led by government officials of Armenia:policemen and prosecutors,committee secretaries of the Commu-nist Party headed by Gorbachev.The mobs of Armenians led by them killed 216 unarmed Azerbaijanian residents,including 57 women,18 children and 5 infants.All the while,they stopped at no method,imaginable and unimaginable,of murdering these poor people,whose only fault lay in their being Azerbaijanian.Armenian doctors in hospitals killed two people.Three people died from refusal of medical care.Killed under torture or simply torn to shreds by bloodthirsty mobs:35 people.Forty-three people died from beatings,including two whose heads were cut off by Armenians.[64-65] Eleven people were burned alive.Four people were murdered and their bodies were mocked and then burned.One person was hanged.Three persons were drowned.Seven people were crushed to death with transport vehicles.Sixteen people were executed by gunfire.Of those who were driven out into the mountains of the Minor Caucasus,into the bitter cold,naked,49 of them froze to death.Kidnapped and lost without a trace,probably dead,were 8 people.One person was electrocuted.Killed inside of transport vehicles were 22 people.Ten people died of shock and fear during the pogroms,including one pregnant woman.One person killed himself during the pogroms.For decades,Armenians have spread the image of their long-suffering halo throughout the world.What these "long-suffering" people really are is seen from the examples already shown.Their visiting card have become the torture and rending of helpless people,mockery over corpses,immolation of living people,beheadings of victims.This is the "long-suffering-ness" as translated from the Armenian into a human tongue.Below is a list of populated areas on the territory of Armenia from which the Azerbaijanian population was expelled along with ubiquitous pogroms.All sorts of property,houses,personal vehicles and money belonging to these poor people were,of course,"acquired" by the "long-suffering" nation.Noyenberyan Region.Dabadavan,Yukhari

lived:Yerevan,Kirovakan,Kafan,Razdan,Stepanavan,Djermuk.Azerbaijanians were expelled from 172 centers of population,where they owned and worked 8,000 square kilometers of land and forests.The refugees consisted of over 200,000 people.Mikhail Gorbachev was perfectly well informed of these unheard-of crimes by the Armenians and that they incurred the beginning of a humanitarian catastrophe.As of January 1989,more than 200,000 40 Azerbaijanians were driven out of Armenia.This was the last and final group of the Azerbaijanian ethnos,which in the beginning of the 20th century consisted of 1,300,000 persons who formed the overwhelming majority of the population in the area now called Armenia.Gorbachev not only did not order an investigation of these enumerated facts which comprised the genocide of the Azerbaijanian people in 1988-1989,and did not demand an explanation by the [68-69] organizers and executors of these monstrous evil acts,but did everything to hide them from the wide circles of global society.The fact of the matter is that Gorbachev consciously entered into a conspiracy and cooperative effort with the more radical and extremist part of Armenian society,because the structure of the rule of the Communist Party was already on the brink of collapse.The situation threatened to elude Gorbachev's control,and his apparatus prepared different scenarios of ruling the country with the help of military repressive methods.The Karabakh conflict he himself provoked could not have surfaced at a better time,for if this conflict had not arisen,one would have had to have been invented.He tried to exploit Armenian ambitions to their maximum effect as a factor which would help him destroy the processes which threatened the power of the party nomenklatura,which meant Gorbachev's well-being,too.Each side entering into this conspiracy against the Azerbaijanian people,that is,Mikhail Gorbachev and the Armenians,both felt that they are manipulating the other,forcing the other to operate according to their own plans and achieving the goals they themselves set.In reality,their goals in this phase of history coincided completely and they acted as a single,well-oiled machine.Armenians introduced a whole group of their own to Gorbachev's circle.Migranian,Ambartsymian,Shakhnazarov,Aganbegyan and other "yans" successfully whispered in Gorbachev's ear what he should do,and how,with regard to the Armenian-Azerbaijanian conflict.On his part,Gorbachev didn't shy away from direct violations of the law,of the actual Constitution,of the norms of international rights.He intentionally misled everyone who might have interfered or hindered his plans.[69] 41 CRT,OR CDC:"COMPANY OF DESPERATE CRIMINALS Using and exploiting the high position he occupied,Gorbachev undertook unprecedented measures towards tearing Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous Region — NKAR — from Azerbaijan,and transferring it to Armenian jurisdiction.He unilaterally formed an invented anti-constitutional entity empowered with the rights of a republic of the Soviet Union and granted this freakish ersatz government the right to rule over the NKAR,depriving Azerbaijan of all authority on governing it.This refers to the creation in January 1989 of the CSA — the Committee of Special Administration,under the lackey of Gorbachev,A.I.Volsky,former Chief of the Department of Machine Construction of the Communist Party.Gorbachev couldn't care less that such a model of authority within the rule of law of the Soviet Union never existed.The directive on the introduction of this form of rule was practically the only document which formalized its structure of rights.It was adopted without any prerequi-[70-71] site consideration and concordance with competent experts.What Gorbachev did in and of itself contradicted the acting Constitution of the USSR.In spite of everything,the directive given to the CSA was simply unlawful,since during its adoption,the Presidium of the Supreme Council of the USSR exceeded its authority and halted the activity of the local council and other laws.The directive was not grounded in law and the structure of an emergency administration,because there simply was no such law in existence.The CSA directive is not a legal government document,but a shameful improvisation perpetrated by an impudent monster deprived of all legitimacy,violating,by the way,Article No.25 of the International Pact of Civil and Political Rights.Why did he embark on this path? Very simple.In that situation,Gorbachev actively played the Armenian side.Armenians,meanwhile,saw to it that Azerbaijan had no authorities in the NKAR,that all efforts in the NKAR had direct supervision in Russia (that is,in Moscow),and as a logical extension,wished to form organs of power independent from Baku.The Soviet Union knew before this of the circus troupe called the CRT,or "Company of Renowned Tricksters." But the CRT? — this was a scandalous example of the Gorbachev political circus and applied to the Azerbaijanian population:the "Company of Desperate Criminals," the CDC.How else can we evaluate the appearance of such a "miscarriage" but as a natural and expected result of the Armenian-Gorbachev cabal? It is unimportant who the "father" was and who was the "mother," who played the "active" and "passive" roles.What matters is that this "miscarriage" was produced.Here is an original scheme by Gorbachev to deceive the Azerbaijanian people and to hand the NKAR over with the help of this "miscarriage" from Azerbaijan to Armenia.[71-72] Opening position:USSR Armenia Azerbaijan NKAR First stage:the appearance between Armenia and Azerbaijan of the CDC USSR Armenia CDC Azerbaijan NKAR Second stage:the transfer of the NKAR under the CDC USSR Armenia CDC Azerbaijan NKAR Third stage:the transfer of the NKAR from CDC to Armenia USSR Armenia CDC Azerbaijan NKAR Fourth stage:Dissolution of the CDC,final position USSR Armenia Azerbaijan [72-73] NKAR Now compare the starting position and ending position:the NKAR was under Azerbaijan,and now it is under the jurisdiction of Armenia,which had to be illustrated.Let us trace how this treacherous plot of Gorbachev's actually played itself out.By the decision of the Goskomstat,or Government Committee for Statistics,(read Gorbachev!)a census was taken of the population with the results falsified to benefit,of course,the Armenians.42 Without the knowledge or consultation of the leaders of Azerbaijan,the Council of Ministers of the USSR (read Gorbachev!)made the decision to withdraw the entire economy of the NKAR from under the Republic of Azerbaijan.Despite the protests of Azerbaijan,Gosplan,or the State Planning Committee of the USSR (read Gorbachev!),unilaterally adopted the planning of the economic and social bloc of the NKAR without the participation of the representatives and specialists of Azerbaijan.The massive import of all sorts of armaments from the territory of Russia and other republics of the Soviet Union flooded the NKAR,using every type of vehicle.An air bridge was formed between Yerevan and Khankyandi (Stepanakert).The arms coming in were actively employed against the Azerbaijanian population.Businesses in the NKAR were subjected to Armenian ministries and departments,and their heads were included in the ranks of the corresponding Armenian ministries.Azerbaijanian flags,coats-of-arms,signs,forms and texts were destroyed.Flags and symbols of Armenia were hoisted over the territory of the NKAR.A special Armenian medal was issued commemorating the attachment of the NKAR to Armenia with the name 'Artsakh." A water main was blown up which had provided water to the city of Shusha,where Azerbaijanians lived.A bridge along the road to the town of Khodjaly,where Azerbaijanians lived,was blown up.The delivery of water from the Sarsang Reservoir to Azerbaijanian-occupied areas was limited.At the same time,members of the Armenian population of the NKAR were issued passports from the Armenian SSR in exchange for their confiscated and destroyed Azerbaijanian documents.The residents of the NKAR were declared citizens of Armenia.The [73-74] handwriting is familiar,is it not? This unlawful action with regard to the passports was successfully employed by Russia while ripping off Georgian territories of Abkhazia and South Ossetia.The population of these regions had their Georgian passports confiscated and destroyed.In exchange,they were given Russian passports and they were declared Russian citizens.If Georgia tries to make a claim on its sovereign territories,the Russian Ministery of Foreign Affairs would begin to hypocritically express their "concern" over the fate of the "Russian" citizens of Abkhazia and South Ossetia,and the Pied Piper,ever obedient to the Kremlin's commands and known by his codename "Zhirinovsky" will immediately begin piping all over television.A unique exchange thus begins.The criminal Armenian knack for trampling upon norms of international rights this time successfully employed Russian forces in Nagorno-Karabakh (Gorbachev raises a toast to Boris Yeltsin and Vladimir Putin!)in Abkhazia and in South Ossetia.Meanwhile,Russian skill in using heavy armaments in carrying out pogroms against the civil population of Baku was well-used in the practice of decapitation by Armenian mobs as they destroyed Khodjaly.The de facto annexation of Nagorno-Karabakh to Armenia was held against the backdrop of a powerful propaganda campaign.The press of Moscow and Armenia bristled with articles on the disorganization of the population in the NKAR,their persecution at the hands of the Azerbaijanian authorities,the dangers they would face should they remain within Azerbaijan proper and other such inventions and yellow-journalistic tidbits.But what was actually the case? What was Nagorno-Karabakh at that time,early 1989? To state it briefly—it was the jewel of Azerbaijan! A blessed and mostly resort-like area.It was for good reason that the Armenians desired to sink this gem into their collective pocket.To elaborate on this:the NKAR is in the south-eastern part of Caucasus Minor.The area is 4,400 square kilometers.From the west to the east,the borders are 60 kilometers apart.From the south to the north,120 kilometers.Despite the small size,the autonomous oblast is covered by three different climatic zones.The mountains are covered with woods and is mainly valuable land.There are many nature sanctuaries.There are ancient [74-75]woods of rare woods,almost unknown in other parts of the planet.The woods are full of game,all sorts of fauna.There are many rivers with significant stocks of fish,at least by local standards.These are the rivers Kuru-chai,Karkar-chai,Khachin-chai,Inzha-chai and others.The largest of these is Terter-chai,where the Sar-sang Ges Reservoir was built,providing nearby regions of Azerbaijan with water.The Armenian settlements are distributed,as a rule,near natural sources of water,springs with perfectly pure and cool water all year round,regardless of ambient temperature.Nagorno-Karabakh springs were praised by many Azerbaijanian poets over the centuries.Many of them,such as Isa-bulag,between Khanki-anda and Shusha,are known throughout the world and are visited by tourists from many countries.The Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous Region,by virtue of its geographical location,lacks cotton plantations and the consequent frequent use of herbicides.The Azerbaijanian population of most of the neighboring regions constantly suffered from the abuse of herbicides,at least at the time.Springs were contaminated,children fell ill,and cattle herds were reduced in number.43 The Armenian population of the NKAR knew none of these problems.Their industries included producing wine and mulberries,making silk and herding sheep.The wineries produced large quantities of dry and fortified wines,and also produced wine spirits for the production of vodka and other strong alcohols.At the same time,the Karabakh Armenians themselves did not buy vodka and wine in stores.Practically every house and every family had a minimum of three types of homemade vodka—vodkas made from wine,mulberries and cherries,and a variegated collection of wines of their own.The production and delivery of wine,including that of "Martu-ni-sovkhoz," "Gadrut" and others,and of wine spirits,allowed the Armenian population of Nagorno-Karabakh to live in wealth,in plenty,and to maintain a much higher standard of living than other regions and localities not only in Azerbaijan but in Armenia and the Caucasus as a whole.In addition,in Khankiandy and other cities,other industries thrived:light industry,local industry,processing agricultural produce and meat,electro-technical,food service,furniture manufacture,building material manufacture,fine marble,etc.[75-76] There also one could find numerous educational establishments,including a university,the Armenian National Theater and other cultural centers.The only lack in this regard was the lack of a rail line.But the leader of Azerbaijan,Geidar Aliyev,reached a successful resolution of this problem.A railroad was planned and built from Agdam to Khankend (Stepanakert)stretching 36 kilometers,26 of which snaked through a very treacherous mountainous region with steep inclines.The foundations of these tracks were mostly laid at a depth of 11-15 meters.The line was equipped with electricity and usable not only by heavy diesel trains but by electric locomotives as well.Two railroad bridges were built,6 overpasses,highway overpasses,train stations with beautiful passenger halls in Askeran and Khankiandy.Construction was completed in 1978,and that year,the capital of Nagorno-Karabakh,through Evlakh and Baku,established rail contact with any other city in the Soviet Union.How did the Armenians of Nagorno-Karabakh thank the Azerbaijanians for this railroad line given to them? Have you guessed yet? That's right! In quintessential Armenian style,with a terrorist act.Of course,at the time they shamelessly called it an unfortunate incident.And so:The eleven wagonloads of building materials were delivered to Askeran Station.These wagons,after the train arrived,the cars were fitted with "boots" which would prevent them from moving.Askeran Armenians,choosing a convenient moment,ran an excavator up to the cars and with a mighty blow with its shovel moved this small train,which proceeded to roll down the incline towards Agdam Station.These eleven cars gained momentum between Askeran and Agdam,a distance of 14 kilometers,reaching great speed —over 100 kilometers an hour —and ripped into Agdam Station.Other rail cars were being unloaded there at the time,and they crashed into them.Significant damage was wrought from the collision.But the most horrifying thing was that two dockworkers were killed while unloading the cars,unsuspecting of the looming danger.The investigation of this terrorist act by the administration of the Autonomy was not completed.The Stapanakert Court convicted only two officials,formally responsible for neglecting safety measures.My friend from Baku,N.Gadjiev,remembered the words of the timeless Nizami Giandjevi:[77-77] "It syania dost olar—bir sumuk atsan,Namard,gadir bilmyaz gurban da olsan!" Which,in the translation of the author of this book,means:"For a bone thrown to a dog,he repays you with friendship,But sacrifice your life for a treacherous scoundrel,and he will not even notice!" The elimination of the CDC and the annexation of Nagorno-Karabakh to Armenia created a very tense situation in Baku and the regions of Azerbaijan.Gorbachev and his Special Services exploited the situation and prepared a final blow to Azerbaijan,after which regular troops could freely be introduced to the territory of the Republic,to establish a military dictatorship in Azerbaijan,to allow it to spread over the rest of the Caucasus and other regions of the USSR.This would restore the weakened power of the Party nomenclature and Party apparatus,it would dispose of the undesirable politicians,disperse social organizations leading the masses of people and achieving real reforms,instead of the cosmetic remodeling of the communist facade already nauseating to everyone.[77] 44 THE TRAGEDY OF BAKU Here were should briefly note the methods Gorbachev planned to employ in realizing his grand provocation.These methods? Pogroms.The locale chosen? Baku,the capital of Azerbaijan.It is well known that in any major city,including Baku,along with the majority of law-abiding citizens,one finds a stratum of criminals,some 1-2% of the population,prepared to violate any law,even to the point of murder,in exchange for compensation.At the beginning of 1990 in Baku,there were some 2 million residents.It isn't difficult to estimate that 1% of this total is about 20,000 people.There was about the same number of radically-inclined citizens among the refugees who settled in Baku from the regions of Armenia and Nagorno-Karabakh.Most of these had lost relatives and loved ones in the pogroms that accompanied the expulsion of the Azerbaijanian population from Armenia.Gorbachev's Special Forces did not waste too much effort corralling from such a contingent the needed number of persons for the manifestation of the plot.Only a few individuals knew of this plan.Now,many years after the events took shape,the majority of their details have become known.[78] 45 This is how Azerbaijanians were killed by bandits wearing the uniforms of the Soviet Army,agents of the Special Services and their hirelings Not only Azerbaijanians,but Armenians,Russians,Jews,Lezgins and Tatars were killed.[79] 46 47 It is bewildering that Gorbachev,inventing and executing what will be described below,and what was already outlined,remains a welcome guest in most capitals of the world,he is greeted by prime ministers and presidents,he is invited to speak at leading universities,he is paid fabulous fees.He is a Nobel laureate and maintains a solid image of a democrat and a peace-maker (from now on,instead of "Gorbachev;' we'll call him "Peacemaker G").So what did "Peacemaker G" dream up for Baku? To use the force of criminal recruits,under the supervision of the Special Services,to execute a pogrom on the Armenian population.Troops belonging to the Ministry of Internal Affairs (the MVD in Russian),consisting of about 12,000 soldiers and officers were not to hinder the pogroms; Armenians were not to be saved.On the contrary,their goal at this stage of the pogrom was to whisk away and protect those who were perpetrating the pogroms,so that no one could stand in the way of the plan devised by "Peacemaker G'.' After the pogrom was over,and the monstrous tallies were made known (for over the 4-5 days,they wished to kill some 10-20,000 Baku Armenians),a plausible reason was already provided to introduce troops,to establish a military dictatorship,to restore the authority of the Communist Party's authority,as the "sole" force able to restore order in the country.During the phase of mobilizing troops,the city of Baku remained vulnerable for 2-3 hours by Armenian reservists,summoned by the military commissariats.The demonic plan itself of "Peacemaker G" was to heighten the antagonism of neighboring peoples—Azerbaijanians and Armenians.At first,the anti-social recruits from among ethnic Azerbaijanians under the protection of MVD soldiers were to conduct a pogrom against Baku Armenians,and later,in revenge,ethnic Armenian reservists from Krasnodarsk,the Stavropol region and Rostov oblast were to slaughter and suffocate the Baku population what-ever their nationality,but under the protection of what was already a regular army.Then,before sunrise,they were taken out of the Baku area,and that morning,society and members of the mass media would be shown "regular" troops,which formally,according to "Peacemaker [79-80] G'"s plan,could not have participated in the Baku pogroms.Try and figure out who killed whom.Maybe they themselves quarreled over something and took up the knife? But we,the Army,the Special Forces,Yazov,Gorbachev and others.we're not to blame.And that's how it happened.But with one correction:the natives of Baku did not permit the destruction of the Armenian population.Of the roughly 15,000 Armenians,only 38 people could not be saved.Everyone else was saved.The first phase of the plot of the pogrom of the people of Baku thought up by "Peacemaker G" was unsuccessful.But we'll return to that later.And so everything was in place.The criminals were recruited,the forces of the MVD were housed in Baku itself,regular troops of the Soviet Army were led up to the borders of Baku.The local coordinator of "Peacemaker G','professional spy Ye.Primakov,acting at the time under the protection of a candidate to the Politburo of the Central Committee of the Communist Party and President of the highest chamber of the Parliament of the USSR —the Soviet Soyuza,or Council of the Union—set up camp in Baku,Defense Minister Yazov was ready at his command post.They awaited their signal.Or rather,a convenient moment.How many times now have the Armenians come to the aid of "Peacemaker G"? They are conspirators,no matter how you slice it.That's all they could do.Most likely they were co-inventors of this devilish plan.And so,on January 12,1990,Armenian military squadrons,well equipped and well armed,executed a helicopter assault in the town of Gushchu Khanlar region in Azerbaijan.The Armenian paratroopers attacked the town and in the very first minutes,shooting automatic weapons and machine guns from the hip,killed a few dozen Azerbaijanian peasants,who did not expect an Armenian assault.Closing ranks,the residents of Gushchu fought off the attack,but their casualties were made known at a large meeting held in Baku on the plaza before the Government Building.An explosion of indignation shook everyone in attendance.Special Forces of "Peacemaker G',' keeping a finger on the pulse of events,understood:the time came.and they gave the signal.Squads of thugs,assigned earlier to each sector of the city and equipped with lists of Armenian addresses from the local Direc-[80-81] tory Service,under the guidance of instructors of Special Forces and under the protection of MVD troops of the USSR,embarked upon their dark mission.Then (and now),many posed the question,who these people committing the pogrom were,who armed them? They did not possess their own weapons.As a rule,these were groups of 10-15 people.Four or five of them were aged 20-25,the rest,teenagers,15-17 years old.In some places they were joined by street punks,or thrill-seekers.Behind these groups,by some 20 meters,was the instructor,who led the group and found the addresses.Could anyone have prevented,or blocked this pogrom of Armenian apartments? Without a doubt,yes.All the forces of the MVD had to do,all these 12,000-odd soldiers in Baku at the time had to do,was budge from their spots.The natives of Baku saw the representatives of the Internal Forces in their streets on the 8th and 48 10th and 12th and 14th of January 1990.They looked the same.Their behavior —the same.Their patrols consisted of five soldiers,regular sergeants,led by an officer,from lieutenant to captain.They were dressed in coats and boots.On their coats were bullet-proof vests.On their heads were caps,or maybe helmets.Their weapons:rubber night-sticks looped to the officer's belts.That was all.No firearms or cold steel to be seen.They stood throughout the city at intersections and in visual contact of each other.But even without weapons they could easily have hindered the work of the perpetrators of the pogrom,or at least scatter them and arrest a number of them.For these were not only soldiers and officers,but young,physically powerful,special-ly-trained warriors.They were trained to fight not only with guns,but in hand-to-hand combat,and in methods that civilians may not even be aware of.They possessed the ability to maim anyone.Especially since a simple signal would have summoned other patrols in their line of sight.I say this with complete confidence,for together with my next-door apartment neighbors in Akhmedlakh (15 kilometers from the center of Baku),on January 14,1990,1 had the experience of meeting a group of vandals who came to our block with the aim of storming Armenian apartments.Two Armenian families resided on our block,on the 3rd and 8th floors (the houses on the block were 9 stories high).[81-82] The thugs arrived in minivans.A small "Moskvich" automobile drove up separately.Besides the driver,there was one other passenger.But at first,the occupants of the Moskvich did not emerge.Some 10-11 persons exited the minivan.Tanks with torches and gas hoses were brought out.Most of the residents of Akhmedlakh had by this time installed front doors with 4-5 millimeter-thick walls,and sometimes with double locks,like those on safes.Sledgehammers and jacks wouldn't open doors like these.So they decided to play it safe.But since we lived pretty far from the city center,they came equipped.They were prepared to cut through these doors.The Armenian family on the third floor had left 2 weeks earlier.The apartment was empty.A neighboring Armenian woman on the 8th floor had not yet left.When the vandals arrived,the neighboring women led her out of her apartment and took her to some Lezgin neighbors on the 9th floor.Then all the men in our apartments descended to the first floor and met the thug at the apartment house entrance.They could not get past these doors.Our neighbor on the second floor asked:"What's the matter,where are you going?" One of the young thugs responded:"Go away,we have to check the Armenian apartments.There is an order to evacuate to the marine passenger terminal." "You're going to evacuate them with those torches?" "That's none of your business!" Another neighbor chimed in:"There is no one in the apartments.They left long ago.We took the Armenian apartments for our children.Go away!"The group of thugs tried to force their way in.We did not let them pass.Neighbors from other buildings came to our aid.The thugs saw that their intentions did not look very promising.Anyway,their leader sitting in the Moskvich grasped that they would not gain access to the Armenian apartments.He emerged from the car and yelled to the thugs:"Let's go back!" The thugs,swearing,leaded their equipment back into the minivan and drove off behind the Moskvich.They never returned to our building.Two days later,the fate of the Baku Armenian victims became known.Apparently,it happened where neighbors had no opportunity to come to their aid.There was a great deal of speculation then,and subsequently,on the "barbarism" of the natives of Baku,and the authors of these accusations blame the Azerbaijanians.What really happened,and what the "long-suffering" side of the adventure really did,as described by the continuing propaganda perpetu-[82-83] ated all over the world to this day,can be judged independently by those reading this book.I wish to turn the reader's attention to the national composition of the episode I just described.There were Azerbaijanians on both sides.The thugs included two clearly Slavic faces towards the back.Of course,no one presented any passports at the time.But the fact that they were not Azerbaijanians and not even from the Caucasus was clear as day.On our side,together with Azerbaijanians,were a Lezgin,a Russian and your humble servant,half-Georgian (through my father),and half-Jewish (through my mother).This example illustrates that the soldiers of the MVD standing in the streets of Baku on January 13-15 1990 could very easily have not only resisted the pogrom,but stopped it dead in its tracks.Could have,but did not.And they did not,because,by the orders of "Peacemaker G',' they were ordered not to.That is,not to save human lives.That is,they were not to get involved.But even with such orders,how could they refuse to help those who directly appealed to them,who ran up to their patrols and begged for help? And this happened.These troops behaved indifferently,and criminally.That is why "Peacemaker G'"s plan,with all its failings,ultimately worked.Thirty-eight Baku Armenians could not be saved,and they were killed by scoundrels in their own homes.Other figures are cited for the number of victims:26,32,46,52,54 and even 75.But in my opinion,the number 38 seems closest to reality.49 Working on this book,I tried to find at least partial lists of the victims.But not one establishment,not one organization,to whom I turned could help me.There is no complete list of victims,unfortunately,not for the events in Baku,nor for events in other populated points of Azerbaijan or Armenia.What was "Peacemaker G" doing with his cohorts when Bakuites were killed in their own apartments by his order,or by order of those under him? After issuing,on January 10,1990,the decree of the Presidium of the Supreme Council of the USSR on the unconstitutional acts of the Supreme Council of the Armenian SSR on Nagorno-Karabakh,"Peacemaker G" waited.He waited for the number of victims to accumulate.Meanwhile,in order to create a political alibi for himself,he departed for Lithuania,where he stayed from January 11-13,persuading the local Communists not to [83-84] leave the Communist Party of the Soviet Union,as they had threatened.But before this,a report came from Sofia,Bulgaria,of the dissolution of the Council of Economic Mutual Aid,a caricature of the socialist "camp" of the European Economic Association.The collapse of the Warsaw Pact was expected any day now.The Socialist camp was tearing at the seams."Peacemaker G" returned to the Trans-Caucasus matter on January 15.The Supreme Council of the USSR issued a decree on the declaration of a state of emergency in the NKAR.Through this decree,"Peacemaker G" contradicts himself:he states the facts on the killings and lootings in Baku,but declares a state of emergency in Nagorno-Karabakh,that is,500 kilometers away from the site of the tragedy.Here once again he exposes himself:he knew of the murder of the residents of Baku,but took no measures to protect them.But why should he.For this would not have accorded with the goals he set for himself.There you have your "democrat!" Here is the "guarantor" of the Constitution! Easily traceable are the intentions of "Peacemaker G" to maintain the "schedule of events":the first stage,the pogrom of Baku,was given 4 days,and that's what it took.Let them go wild.Especially since he was probably given reports by the Special Services that the number of unfortunate victims in Baku is far below the number "Peacemaker G" had planned.So they had to wait.And wait he did.But by January 16,the pogrom petered out.Of the fifteen-some-odd thousand Baku Armenians,the residents of Baku and representatives of the National Azerbaijanian Front evacuated some 10,000 on ferries,some 500 people were evacuated by air and other vehicles,and the rest were hidden in apartments.Of those Armenians whom the native Bakuites hid in their homes in January 1990,many remained to live there until 1992,1993,and some of them continue to live there to this day.I know a family where the husband is Azerbaijanian and the wife is Armenian.They survived the pogrom of 1990 and remained in Baku until 1992.Afterwards they left,selling their apartment and hauling out their furniture,to settle permanently in Novorossiisk,where they opened a business.And I know another family where the husband and wife are Armenians,who returned to Baku to collect their things in 1992.They gathered everything and left for the USA.To those who are inter-[84-85] ested I can provide names,surnames,telephone numbers,addresses.All these people are my good friends.And every Bakuite who lived through that terrible time with their Armenian neighbors can also name such Armenian or Azerbaijanian-Armenian families as did I.Some of those who suffered remained in Baku hospitals under the protection of representatives of the National Front.There was no one left to attack.What could "Peacemaker G" do? This is not an idle question.If one compares the pogrom by the Armenians of the Azerbaijanian town of Gushchu of January 12 and the great pogrom of the Armenian apartments in the Baku of 2 million people of 13-15 January,then by the standards of the time,whatever happened in Baku should have long ago been forgotten,just as the events in Gushchu were forgotten.Judge for yourselves:of the roughly 1000 Azerbaijanians living in Gushchu,Armenians killed 20 people over the course of a few hours.Of the Armenian population in the city of Baku numbering 15,000,the agents of "Peacemaker G" managed to kill some 40 people over the course of 4 days.The percentage of Azerbaijanians killed in Gushchu was about 2% of the population.The percentage of Armenians killed in Baku was about 0.27%.One of every 50 Azerbaijanians was killed.One out of every 375 Armenians was killed.But the pogroms in Baku are known throughout the world,and because of this,many parliaments,including the legislative body of the USA,have imposed sanctions against Azerbaijan.The pogrom in Gushchu is known to almost no one except the residents of Gushchu themselves.No sanctions were imposed on Armenia.They continue to be,as they were before,"long-suffering." Of course,a great deal of what was described in the above paragraph "Peacemaker G" could not have known,since the sanctions and other events during his tenure as "Chairman" and "President of the Soviet Union" had not yet occurred.But the arithmetic remains the same.And he could certainly count.Returning to the question standing before "Peacemaker G":What to do now? He decided to continue the pogrom as planned despite the fact that he could not understand why and how the pogrom was failing; that it could not attain the required goal of "Peacemaker G',' which was to preserve the power of the Communist Party,consequently,his own power as the General Secretary of [85-86] the Party.Herein lies the lowness,the abomination,the cynicism and rotten,despicable essence of this Nobel laureate:he knew that the sacrifice of 50 innocent,unsuspecting Bakuites would be useless; yet he consciously proceeded with the destruction of peaceful citizens,his citizens,citizens of his country,the country he headed and whose rights and freedoms he guaranteed,indeed,he was to guaranteed by international law.After he issued the order to continue the pogrom of the Bakuites with the help of the regular troops and the Armenian reservists,he again subjected himself to possible criminal investigation and indictment.It would have been very desirable if at least some Prime Ministers and Presidents would read my book and understood whose hand they shake every once in a while.An order was issued by the Presidium of the Supreme Council of the USSR over the signature of "Peacemaker G" on January 19,1990,"On the Declaration of a State of Emergency in the City of Baku." On the basis of this decree,troops entered Baku from three sides.Leading the way was heavy armor.Behind them,Armenian reservists,and in the third echelon,the full force of the regular army consisting of over 30,000 soldiers and officers.Inside Baku was a garrison of Salian barracks and the aforementioned 12,000 troops of the MVD.But now they were armed and acted decisively.This is not even counting the Special Divisions of the KGB of the USSR,whose actions before and during the pogroms will be described below.A bloody battle ensued."Peacemaker G" expressed his wrath at the civil population of Baku for its sabotage of his plan of the utter destruction of the Armenian population,for his own failures in foreign affairs,for his powerlessness before the realization of the fact that no bloody bacchanalia could change anything.His days were numbered,the Socialist Camp faded into history,the Communist Party was dead,the Union's republics were disobedient,the Union was falling apart,and ahead lie—the unknown.For all this,the Bakuites had to pay with their blood and the lives of the innocent victims of the pogrom.And now,in order of events.Before you,dear reader,is the Decree of "Peacemaker G":[86-87] DECREE Of the Presidium of the Supreme Council of the USSR On the Declaration of the State of Emergency in the City of Baku In connection with the extreme elevation of the situation in the City of Baku,through the attempts of criminal extremist forces through the use of violence,the organization of mass disorders,to remove from power lawfully acting organs,and in the interests of the defense and security of the citizens,the Presidium of the Su-preme Council of the USSR,in accordance with Point 14 of Article 119 of the Constitution of the USSR,DECREES:On January 20,1990,to declare a State of Emergency in the City of Baku,extending throughout its territory the action of the Decree of the PSC of the USSR of January 15,1990.The President of the SC of the USSR M.Gorbachev Moscow,Kremlin January 19,1990 Please note how deceitful and amoral his text is! "In connection with the extreme elevation of the situation in the City of Baku." — but the situation elevated extremely not on January 19,but on the 12,h,when the Armenians soldiers attacked Gushchu.The pogroms of the Armenian population in accordance with your order,Mr President,began on January 13 and ended on the 16th.Where were you,and why did you "oversleep"? On January 19,no one was attacking anyone.The situation stabilized.On January 17th,a plenary session of the Party of the Baku City Council was held.Participating were your agents and spies,your emissaries,your "eyes and ears," comrades E.M.Primakov and A.N.Girenko.On January 18th,the violence was condemned by the Administration of the National Front.The city gradually returned to normal.Why these lies? There was no elevation of the situation on January 19th,1990."[A]ttempts.to remove from power lawfully acting organs." — again,lies and hypocrisy.In that period of two years,every single government organ was already liquidated the NKAR.The region was run by self-appointed "committees" of various shades and flavors.Soviet rule was gone.No one was concerned,no one was upset about this,not even "Peacemaker G'.' No one sent troops in,no one organized pogroms,no one was killed.Why not? Be-[87-88] cause this was a component of the conspiracy against Azerbaijan,in which "Peacemaker G" was a conspirator.He could not send forces in against one of his allies.This would equate sending troops in against himself."[I]n the interests of the defense and security of the citizens.',' "Peacemaker G" continues disingenuously.If he were really concerned about the defense and safety of the people of the city of Baku,he would not have been a bystander during the pogroms of the Armenian apartments.It was utterly unnecessary to conduct a military operation with several corps of the regular army,and with reinforcements.It was enough to issue an order to the troops of the MVD,and no pogroms would have occurred.There were no such orders in 1988,nor in 1989.No one except the Special Services was going to attack Armenians in Baku.51 They left the city,knowing full well that after the expulsion of Azerbaijanians from Armenia,their Armenian leaders left them no choice.They had to leave.No one stopped them.One way or another,they sold their homes,withdrew their savings,rented containers without any problems to pack and ship their furniture.Armenians fled Baku,because they were subjected to the whims of fate.The exodus of Armenians continued throughout the year of 1989.During this period,there was not one instance of an attack on an Armenian.Not one of them suffered anything.During the course of 1989,the number of Armenians dropped from 200,000 to approximately 15,000.They left under pressure of circumstances beyond their control and the control of other Bakuites.What sense was it to attack them? No one but "Peacemaker G" was even thinking of it.As for the internal troops,on January 13-15,1990,they did not protect civilians from pogroms,quite the opposite,they protected the attackers from the civilians.There was never a precedent for this in any other country."[I]n accordance with Point 14 of Article 119 of the Constitution of the USSR." Again,a shameless lie.The state of emergency in Baku could not have been introduced without the knowledge and consent of the Supreme Council of Azerbaijan specifically in accordance with Article 19 of the aforementioned Constitution of the USSR.Such consent was not given by the Supreme Council of [88-89] Azerbaijan.Besides,what was missing was a legislative act regulating the lawfulness of the state of emergency.In connection with this,"Peacemaker G'"s decree was from the outset unconstitutional and unlawful.Besides,the population of Baku was not informed of this decree.Moreover,it was done specifically in a way that no advance notice could have been made.The Special Forces of "Peacemaker G" blew up the television station and destroyed radio broadcast-ing equipment at 5:27 pm on January 19th,1990,and at 7:30 pm,the soldiers began the pogrom without awaiting the time scheduled for it,midnight,January 20th.The pogrom from the very first minutes was accompanied by the shooting up of cars and pedestrians.At midnight of January 20,the soldier of the Soviet Army had already killed nine Bakuites.It was only at 7:00 am of January 20th that the decree of "Peacemaker G" was announced over the radio,late by seven hours.By that time,the Armenian reservists finished their "work" and they were transported outside the city and released to their homes in Russian areas.The slaughter and killings of Bakuites was carried further with regular troops.By the moment the decree was broadcast over the radio,that is,from 9:30 pm on January 19th to 7:00 am on January 20th,1990,82 Bakuites suffered a martyr's death and 20 had mortal injuries from which they later died,all at the hands of the Armenian reservists and military cadres.At the same time,this fact stands out:shooting is resorted to only after all other measures fail:negotiations with the population,threats over loudspeakers,the use of tear gas,water hoses,the firing of weapons in the air.None of this happened.The troops rushed into the streets of a sleeping city and began shooting randomly from all sorts of firearms,including tank artillery and heavy-caliber machine guns at anything that moved.Here are the results of the actions under the command of D.Yazov (recently,in November 2004,a high-level decoration was bestowed upon him by V Putin—was this not for Baku "achievements?")in accordance with the decree of Mikhail Gorbachev:On the night of January 19th-20th,1990,killed in Baku were:42 picketers standing at the entrances to Baku at streets covered with cars; 9 who rushed through gaps in the soldiers to help the wounded and suffering; [89-90] 6 in automobiles while transporting the wounded to medical centers; 17 during the shooting up of light vehicles and municipal buses and trolleys.These people did not have any information regarding the Decree of "Peacemaker G" on the sending of soldiers,of the state of emergency,and went about their own business:7 in their apartments and houses during the spraying of fire from military positions; 19 near their homes when,unaware of what was happening in the city,they emerged,having heard gunfire; 5 from unknown reasons.Data on the bodies of 94 Bakuites:82 died from gunfire; 9 died from wounds inflicted with blunt objects; 2 died from wounds from sharp,serrated weapons; 1 died from strangulation.Of the 82 who died of gunshot wounds:44 were shot in the back,that is,people were fired upon as they fled,presenting absolutely no threat of any kind to the troops; 38 were shot from the front; 29 were shot in the head—the fallen and injured were "finished off"; 39 were killed by shots in the abdomen; 52 4 were shot in the lower limbs; 10 were killed from injuries throughout the body.Nine cases of death from wounds inflicted by blunt objects:these were a result of being run over by caterpillar treads; that is,these unfortunate souls were crushed to death by tanks.Numerous breaks in the skeletal bones were discovered,the dismembering of limbs,the crushing of skulls,the pulverization of internal organs.Of the dead:124 were men; 7 were women; 7 were adolescents; 70 were family members,whose death left behind 159 orphans.Among those killed while working:5 police officers; [90-91] 2 emergency room doctors; even white medical coats did not prevent them from the killers.Wounded were 764 persons,of whom 176 were left invalids,including 21 women.Missing without a trace:4 people.There are records of the death of soldiers from "friendly gunfire" between military subdivisions,as a result of the lack of coordination of operations.The main type of bullet used by the Soviet Army against the peaceful Bakuites was the so-called "exploding" bullet with a displaced center of gravity,of the MZhV-13 type,banned by international conventions.Two hundred houses and apartments were damages,88 automobiles,including those destroyed by incendiary shells.The assault on Baku by troops of the Soviet Army on January 19th-20th,1990,is comparable to the invasion of Hungary in 1956 and the incursion into Czechoslovakia in 1968,which were accompanied by instances of rape,which the Armenian troops and reservists committed with particular brutality.Along with the mass killings of utterly innocent civilians,divisions of the Soviet Army and other military cadres also widely rounded up and held Bakuites and the residents of other areas of Azerbaijan,unlawfully and without reason,under false pretenses,misusing the decree on the state of emergency.They also did not bother themselves with inspecting necessary documents as is dictated by law.For this reason,the exact number of arrestees civilians has not been established,but there were several thousand of these.Of those whose documents were recorded —and there were 841 such persons —numerous violations occurred,not only of existing laws,but of elementary rights relating to the holding of people under arrest.One hundred twenty-seven persons were taken out of Azerbaijan.Of those who remained in Baku and the surround-ing region,where no state of emergency was declared,the civilians were held in prisons and isolation cages together with common criminals.A large contingent of arrestees was held in unsuitable places,in basements with no light,without food or water,in unsanitary conditions.With the aim of concealing the fact of mass arrests of the civil population,relatives of those held and under arrest were not in-[91-92]formed.Everywhere these arrests were accompanied by beatings,torture and theft.The lives of the people being held were in constant and real danger.In two cases,when citizens attempted to object to the illegal actions of the military authorities,they were immediately executed.One was beaten to death,another strangled.No one investigated these deaths,and the guilty parties went unpunished.But besides regular troops,divisions of internal soldiers and Armenian reservists,special militarized groups without any identifying marks on their uniforms also acted against the Bakuites.In Apsheron Hotel alone,150 representatives of these groups were housed.It was members of one of these groups who were involved in the explosion of the Baku television station two hours before the entry of soldiers into the city.Their actions were noted in other areas of Baku,both before and after the troops invaded the city.Who they belonged to was only discovered after January 26th,when a similar group,in Moscow this time,attacked the Permanent Mission of Azerbaijanian,one of them was arrested and handed over to the KGB of the USSR ; it was a member of the National Front,E.Mamedov.It became possible to establish that these special groups were part of the KGB.Eyewitness Accounts.AMIRYUSIFOY Imdat Mansur ogly,born 1961."On the night of January 19-20,1 and thousands of other people,stood at the Salian barracks,talking.Suddenly,soldiers,with no warning at all,opened fire.From one side,soldiers were shooting,on the other,tanks drove onto the people.We were not allowed to take the injured away,and soldiers were shooting at people who were running away.I was wounded in both legs and fell to the ground.We were shot at from all sides.Tanks blocked all the roads.I crawled away.Suddenly one of the tanks began moving in our direction.It rode over cars that were in its way.Soldiers were approaching the wounded 53 and kicked them and beat them with billy-clubs.I began to crawl towards the residential buildings.In the courtyard,some strangers came to my aid and took me to the hospital by taking back streets." ABASOY Abas,town of Bina."On the evening of January 19,I was on my way home.Near the road in Bina I saw a gathering of [92-93] people.I came closer.While talking to them,I saw that tanks were approaching.Suddenly they began firing at these unarmed,peaceful people.I was injured in my leg.I am an old man,I have endured three heart attacks,and when I asked the Soviet soldiers for help,they came up and began to kick me.They turned me over,face down,and began to search me.I was brought,in great pain,to the hospital by the Bina townspeople." TIMENKO,Igor Yurievich,Baku,5th micro-region."On the night of January 19th-20th,I was paving the road in the area of the Salian barracks (along Tbilisi Prospekt).At 12:10 am,shooting began,while I sat in the car and warmed myself.I was hit in the left shoulder with a bullet.Soldiers were shooting at peaceful civilians! The soldiers were shooting from all sides,at random.The shooting began when a red rocket burst overhead.No one was warned.These weren't human beings,these were hired killers,who shot at unarmed people.I had four fellows with me in the car,I didn't know them,we were all warming ourselves.I don't remember anything else." GASANOY Rufat Djevanshir ogly,City of Giandja."I was visiting my brother in the town of Musabekov.Hearing gunshots,we walked towards Eleventh Army Plaza and saw tanks (each one had 6-7 soldiers with automatic weapons).When there were about 150 meters left between us,they opened fire (first in the air)and then right after that into the people.There were about 500 unarmed people.I began to run away and wanted to hide among the pine trees.I was injured in the right leg and left hand.My left leg was wounded and burned by an exploding bullet.While some young men were taking me to the hospital,the soldiers began firing again.When I got to the hospital,they power had been turned off,so the medics began treating me under candlelight." ALIYEV Nadir,town of Buzovna."On January 19,my cousin and I were going to the airport.Between midnight and 1:00 am,shooting began on the road.I was an eyewitness of how soldiers shot into the backs of fleeing people.And how people,in agony,were being stabbed in the back with bayonets.Our headlights illuminated the faces of the soldiers.They were very tall,with long hair,moustaches,[93-94] beards.Our whole car was riddled with bullets.Four bullets hit me,of those,3 hit my kidneys,one was a flesh wound.With me in the emergency room was a young man,22 years old,from the town of Gres,named Fuad.He was wounded by a bullet and stabbed with a bayonet,from which he died.That night I saw 50 bullets fired at a dead man." ISKENDEROV,Eishan,of Baku,town of Khyrdalan,born 1962."On the night of January 20,on the road leading from the Eleventh Army towards Baladjary,an armored transport vehicle appeared.Behind him were soldiers.We sat down on the asphalt to stop the soldiers.Suddenly from the micro-district,a tank started bearing down on the people.At the same time,tanks started coming from the plaza,and they began firing.One fellow stayed under the tank.When we approached his dead body,they began firing at us.I was wounded in the leg and torso.They were shooting at the people who were running away.I saw the shooters' faces —they were all 30-35 years old." ASKEROV,Arif Beilyar ogly,born 1950."On the night of January 20,at 12:01 am,I stood at the intersection near Iskra Factory.At first,one tank appeared,opened fire and began driving onto people.From the Baladjarov side,soldiers first appeared,wearing helmets,with bayonets,and behind them military vehicles.There were some three thousand people who approached the soldiers to stop them.But the soldiers advanced at pressed us against the vehicles.From the Tbilisi side,2-3 armored vehicles came.They opened fire on the people,among whom were our agsakali [elders].At this time I was shot in the leg.Among the people were children,women,old people.Not one of them was armed.We did not let the children throw stones at the soldiers.The soldiers were very tall,wearing helmets.The kids dragged me in between the trees,then I was sent to the hospital." SHIRINOV,Novruz Burzu ogly,born 1965."On January 19,at 9 p.m.,my brother and I arrived at Eleventh Army Plaza (the bloody square).The first thing I noticed was that the people were unarmed.At about 12:15 in the morning,from Eleventh Army Prospekt,15-20 tanks and armored vehicles rolled into the square.Without [94-95] warning,they began firing at the unarmed people,who exhibited no resistance whatsoever.My brother and I began dragging away the wounded towards the Republican Hospital.Afterwards,my brother and I came out again and near the Eleventh Army Memorial,I was wounded in the left leg,above the knee.My brother was taken to the hospital.There the wounded were given all the care possible.Doctors and nurses acted heroically.Soldiers in armored cars shot at the medical personnel and the hospital." 54 ADYSHIRINOV,Vidadi Tazakhan ogly,born 1966."On the 19 th,at 6 in the evening I left work near Giandjlik Metro Station,went towards the Salian barracks,from there to Chapaev Street.Late in the evening,around 12 o'clock,tanks arrived,shooting at cars and houses.Then the soldiers came.I got into a car (a "Maz")hoping to protect myself,and hid in the cabin.Seeing that I was hiding,they began shooting.A bullet went through a side window and lodged into my left side.Another grazed my hand.Then I got out of the cabin and hid behind a tire.Then I saw a fallen person and crawled up to him.Grabbing him by his shoulder,I dragged him to a house.There were people there.I left him with them.I said that I was wounded.I was taken into an apartment,laid down onto a couch,they poured iodine onto my wound and called for an ambulance.An ambulance took me to E.Efendiev Hospital.While I was being placed in the ambulance,until it drove off,it was shot at more than once.These events occurred on Chapaev Street,near the Fish Institute,on January 19 between midnight and 12:30 am,January 20,1990,in Baku." KADYRLY,Garib Museib ogly,town of Bina,City of Baku."I,Kadyrly,an oil worker of 40 years tenure,father of 5 children,on January 19,1990,summoned by the Central Committee,as a senior citizen,went out onto the highway of the town of Bina to make sure everything was in order.Suddenly,unarmed people were fired on.I was in a car that was hit with 17 bullets.I was injured in the head and the hand.Two bullets are still lodged in my hand,which give me great pain.I accuse the refugee Vezirov and his chief,Gorbachev,in the spilling of blood of innocent people."

administration,married."On the night of January 19-20,1990,he was visiting his relative,M.M.Tesilov.Hearing the noise of gunfire,they went into the street and saw that Bakuites were being shot at near the Eleventh Army Memorial.They came nearer.They helped the injured.During one of the trips to recover the wounded,soldiers shot him.At the same time,tear gas was being used.In the ensuing confusion,Tesilov lost track of Abulfatov.But some time later he found him and another three people wounded at the entrance to the metro.It was difficult to come close to the injured,since the only way to reach them was being shot up by the soldiers.With difficulty,the injured were reached and taken to the hospital.But on the way,M.M.Abulfatov died.ABILGASANOV,Ilgar Yusif ogly,Azerbaijanian,born 1967 in Baku,correspondence student of the D.Bunyat-zade Personnel Management Institute,sergeant-minor of the police,single.Wounded on the night of January 19-20,1990,died on January 23,in the hospital.That night,after a shift with the police of the Oktyabrsky Region of Baku,he was returning home on his family's car.Near Nakhichevan Hotel,he was shot up by unknown soldiers.After being to the hospital,he underwent an operation.The operation lasted several hours.The lights went out,and the doctors worked under candlelight and paper torches.The wound turned out to be fatal,and on January 23,1990,1.Yu.Abilgasanov died.ABDIEV,Tariel Orudj ogly,Azerbaijanian,born 1949 in the town of Garanoy,Shamkhor Region,middle education,employee of Renovation Trust No 4,married,two children.On the night of January 19-20,1990,he was wounded by soldiers on Eleventh Army Plaza.He was taken to a nearby house.He remained there for nearly an hour.Then Tariela and Djavida Yunos ogly Ismailov,taken from the street,were taken to a hospital in an ambulance.Still,the soldiers shot up the ambulance and it crashed.After this,the wounded were sent to the hospital in a different car.Because of the lack of electricity in the hospital,the operation on Tariel lasted for four hours under the light of a kerosene lamp.He underwent a second [96-97] operation on January 22,which lasted 5 hours.But on January 26,his condition worsened and on the 27th,TO.Abdiev died.AGAVERDIEV,Aslan Ali-Ikram ogly,Azerbaijanian,born in Baku,middle education,worker at a factory of household products,married,three children.On the night of January 19th-20th,1990,when the soldiers began firing,Agaverdiev was at home.Fearing for the safety of his father,who was in the neighboring house at a relative's home,he emerged into the street and headed there.Near No.60,Dj.Djabarli Street,he was hit by solders' bullets and fatally injured.While injured,he said that a tall,heavy,middle-aged man with long hair was shooting at him.Agaverdiev was taken to the hospital,but could not be saved.On January 22,1990,he died.KARAEV,Ilgar Ali ogly,Azerbaijanian,born in Baku,middle technical education.On the night of January 19-20,together with a group of civilians at the Salian barracks,he was conducting a peaceful protest against the introduction of troops into Baku.When the military vehicles and personnel emerged from the base,Karaev was killed with a shot to the head from a gun.55 The killings occurred not only on January 20th.Bakuites were dying even on the 24th,when it seemed that order was restored.But soldiers,sensing the lack of accountability,and feeling "frisky” were driving armored vehicles onto parked cars without any apparent reason.They did not bother thinking about whether anyone was in the automobiles And so on January 24,1990,on the way to work on the 22-kilometer road of Baku-Sumgait,a doctor of chemistry was killed,Professor Svetlana Gamid kizi Mamedova and doctor of chemistry Ibragim Ismail ogly Ibragimov.These professionals,authors of 250 scholarly works and over 90 inventions,became the victims of senseless,barbaric murder.They threatened no one.They were simply driving to work.Still,soldiers from the last vehicle of a military convoy,"just like that" ran up onto the Zhiguli automobile and crushed the Azerbaijanian doctors.Analogous crimes were committed by soldiers on the Baku-Rostov highway not far from the town of Khurdalan.They used a tank to crush a car belonging to residents of the city of Grozny,Bashir [97-98] Merezhkov and Anatoly Kunitsin,who were returning from a business trip in Baku.Merezhkov and Kunitsin miraculously remained alive,only because they jumped out of the car,yet were still seriously wounded.A doctor of the 15th Municipal Station Emergency Room Service,Alexander Vitalievich Merezhko,shot by troops while helping the wounded Bakuites.And what of the ambulance driver of City Hospital No 29,Rakhman Ashrafov,killed by Yazov's butchers while delivering medicine and medical equipment to aid the injured and suffering? This sorrowful list goes on and on.Concurrently with the pogroms and brutal genocide of the entire population of Baku,a wide-ranging provocation was aimed at bringing the Russian and Azerbaijanian populations to clash,to create hatred for the Azerbaijanians among the Russians living throughout Russia,all over the territory of the Soviet Union.Just a few days before the pogrom,the military command began the forced evacuation of military families and other representatives of the Russian population in Baku to various regions of the USSR.This prevocational action was conducted allegedly to ensure the personal safety of the Russians living there from attacks upon them that extremist groups were preparing.In fact,there was no such danger for the Russian population from the Azerbaijanians in the area,and there could not have been any such danger.The events of January 1990 totally exposed Gorbachev's scheme.The Russian population was subjected to attacks along with the entire population of Baku,but only at the hands of the soldiers of the Soviet Army under the direction of the Russian Marshall Yazov,who executed the orders of the Russian Commander-in-Chief,Gorbachev,during which 6 Russian Bakuites were killed by Russian weapons fired by Russian solders.Azerbaijanians had nothing to do with this crime committed by Moscow.The mass return to Baku of the overwhelming majority of the Russian residents who were earlier surreptitiously removed on military transport planes is an obvious confirmation of this.After the genocide of the Bakuites occurred,Moscow did everything it could to remove from the path of danger all those who were one way or another involved in its organization and execution.No investigation was conducted of this tragedy.The study conducted by the Azerbaijanian side drew no support from within the Soviet [98-99] Union's organs,which declined to make a political,judicial or legal ruling on the events.The Azerbaijanian side produced 108 volumes of proof of the genocide in Baku in January of 1990.Sixty-nine of these were confiscated by Moscow and held there for a long period of time without any judicial or prosecutorial action taken.Then all sorts of obstacles and conditions were set to return these materials,which shed a great deal of light on the guilty parties in the genocide.On March 29,1990,in Moscow,at the insistence of the Azerbaijanian side,a closed meeting of the Supreme Council of the USSR was held.The Azerbaijanian delegation demanded the creation of a Governmental Commission on investigation the actions of the army and the Special Services in the committing of the genocide against the civilians of Baku.Yet as a result of pressure applied by V Kriuchkov,D.Yazov and V.Bakatin,the Azerbaijanian demands were rejected,and no commission was formed.Moreover,criminal case No.104 initiated by decree of the Chief of the Prosecutor Group of the Main Military Prosecution Office of the USSR,V.S.Medvedev,opened earlier on the basis of the materials prepared by the Azerbaijanian representatives,was dismissed on December 20,1990,with the explanation:"for lack of criminal actions committed by military servicemen," which sounds like a cynical and outrageous justification of genocide.208 killed:157 Azerbaijanians,38 Armenians,6 Russians,3 Jews,2 Tatars,2 Lezgins.764 wounded:of whom 176 remained invalids.4 missing without a trace.159 children orphaned,not counting the hundreds interned,and the enormous material loss —all this was called by Moscow "lack of criminal action." Such was Communist jurisprudence,such is Communist justice.56 The attentive reader has probably noticed that the name of "Peacemaker G','that is Gorbachev,is rarely seen anymore.There is a reason for this.The events in Baku were the beginning of the end of the Gorbachev era.Further events transpired not so much at his will,but despite it.By inertia he was able to become President of the USSR,but only a year later,Yeltsin's shoe kicked his behind forever out of the Kremlin.He did not get the message and later [99-100] even tried to participate in the presidential elections in Russia,but was roundly slapped down twice by the electorate and became a political corpse.Of course,some active politicians still derive some pleasure from sniffing the odor of this corpse.[100] 57 THE FALL OF THE "EVIL EMPIRE" The 'Evil Empire" was falling apart,and the following events concurrently in 1990:January 23:Soviet forces request permission to leave Czechoslovakia.January 24:Boris Nikolaevich Yeltsin poses the question of including the RSFSR into the United Nations as an independent republic.January 30:the decision is made to reunite the German Democratic Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany into one state.February 4:a 200,000-strong demonstration Moscow is held to repeal the monopoly on power of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union.February 5-7:at a plenary session of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union,the recommendations to the 28th Conference of the CPSU on the recognition of a multi-party system in the USSR is adopted,as is the rejection of a leading role for the CPSU in society.More proof of the irrationality of the bloody conflict in Baku.For it was specifically for the preservation of the so-called "leading role" of the CPSU that troops had been mobilized.[100-102] The Armenian-Azerbaijanian conflict was set up by the head of the CPSU himself only served to conceal his aims.The Karabakh Autonomous Region was handed over to the Armenians for the same goal.Now,some 17 days after the mass killings,the traditional forty-day mourning period for the victims had not even ended yet,and now the CPSU was hypocritically declaring its readiness to cede its "leading role." Was it really necessary to quench their thirst for Bakuite blood,and only then reach this conclusion? February 26:Soviet forces request withdrawal from Hungary.March 11:Lithuania declares independence.March 12-15:an Extraordinary Third Conference of the People's Deputies.Mikhail Gorbachev is elected President of the USSR.Article 6 of the Constitution on the leading role of the CPSU is repealed.March 23:Soviet Army troops are moved into Vilnius.March 25:The Communist Party of Estonia withdraws from the CPSU.April 16:Gavriil Popov is elected Mayor of Moscow.April 18:An economic embargo is declared against Lithuania.May 23:Anatoly Sobchak is elected Mayor of Leningrad.May:The Union of the Descendants of Russian Nobility is formed.May-June:Inter-ethnic conflicts spread from the Caucasus to Central Asia.Hundreds are killed.But no one is worried.The grab for power is in full swing.At a Conference of the People's Deputies of the RSFSR elects Boris N Yeltsin the President of the Presidium of the Supreme Council.With such hope did Azerbaijanians follow Yeltsin's rise to power! They hoped that with his taking the reins of leadership,the question of Nagorno-Karabakh would be settled.Who would guess that the "democrat" Yeltsin would "grant" the people of Azerbaijan the Khodzhal horror,and,arming the Armenians,would take away all of Karabakh simply because Azerbaijan doubted the wisdom of jointing the Commonwealth of Independent States? June:the military organization of the Warsaw Pact is dispersed.Soviet forces are withdrawn from the GDR.June 11:A 24-hour strike of the miners of Donbass under the political slogans of the nationalization of the property of the CPSU and the closing of the mine workers' party committees.[102-103] July 12:Censorship is revoked.At the 28th Conference of the CPSU,Yeltsin removes himself from that body.Following his lead are Gavriil Popov and Anatoly Sobchak.A steady,mass exodus from the Party ensues.No one fears reprisals.But the Azerbaijanian communists had withdrawn from the CPSU in December 1989-January 1990.All Bakuites remember the large wooden crate standing before the Government Building.These were receptacles for the discarded Party cards.When the crate was full,it was burned with all its contents,and another crate would take its place.And this was repeated over and over.This was also a reason why Bakuites were shot in January 1990.How time flies! Seven months later,and no one was executed for leaving the CPSU (as Bakuites were); they were applauded (as Yeltsin was).July 15:A law is issued on the revocation of the Communist Party's control over radio and television.Four hundred thousand people demonstrate against Communism in Moscow.July 16:The Supreme Council of the Ukrainian SSR declares sovereignty.August:Tadjikistan,Turkmenia and Armenia declare independence.Inter-ethnic clashes occur in the Gagauza regions of Moldavia.September 12:An agreement between England,the GDR,the USSR,the USA,France and the FRG on the final resolution of the German problem:Germany is reunited,the occupying forces are withdrawn,Germany becomes a member of NATO.58 October:Kazakhstan declares sovereignty.Yeltsin declared the withdrawal of the RSFSR from direct subjugation to the Soviet Union.October 15:Mikhail Gorbachev receives the Nobel Peace Prize.November 27:The Congress of the Chechen Nation declares independence for the Chechen-Ingush ASSR.Under external and internal pressure,the Moscow authorities gradually lose control over the situation in the country.Despite the fact that Gorbachev was elected President of the USSR in March 1990,this changed nothing.His failure to resolve the problems that swamped him continued.In my opinion,he did not know how to resolve them.The Armenian-Azerbaijanian conflict initiated by Moscow in 1987-1990 spun out of the control of the central powers and assumed a life of its own.It was not the only one by then,as it had been in 1988,but one of many.[103-104] The republics of Central Asia simmered,the Baltics seethed,real central power was being transferred from the leadership of the USSR to the leadership of the RSFSR.Under those circumstances,Moscow simply forgot about the problem of Nagorno-Karabakh.They had no time for it.The Armenian side immediately exploited the situation.Its armed units launched a campaign of terror at the borders,destroying Azerbaijanians on Azerbaijanian territory near the border of the two republics.At the same time,a there was a new element in the activity of the Armenian bands:in word declaring their friendship with Russian soldiers from the internal units and regular army of the USSR,in deed they proceeded to kill all military servicemen in Nagorno-Karabakh and the areas near the border between Armenia and Azerbaijan.Here are a few reports from the region in those years:On the night of March 24,1990,from the Shamshadin Region of Armenia,a town of the Kazakh area was subjected to artillery and mortar fire.From several towns,for instance Baganis Airim,the population had to be evacuated.Taking advantage of the abandonment of residential homes,the town was occupied by the Armenian bands,which completely looted it.They drove away livestock,took everything belonging to the Azerbaijanians,and as they left,burned all the houses and constructions to the ground.There were victims.Six local Azerbaijanians who weren't able to flee their homes,including 2 women and a 2-month-old child,were killed,their corpses burned.Two Azerbaijanian policemen,trying to defend their town,were also killed.Armenia,now openly defying the central authorities in Moscow,created a web of training bases for their militants along the Azerbaijanian border,and equipped more and more militarized units,who found that their sole resistance was a single Azerbaijanian policemen assigned to each town.Armenian militant groups equipped themselves with everything needed from three main sources:theft from military warehouses,deliveries collected from Armenians in the diaspora,theft from international shipments intended for earthquake relief.In fact,they robbed foreign humanitarian aid to organize the murder of the Azerbaijanian population.[104-105] In the 20's of May,1990,a group of armed Armenian militiamen tried to disarm soldiers of the Interior Forces escorting a train between Yerevan and Kafan.Soon,armed bandits in Yerevan attacked a military encampment of Soviet soldiers with the aim of seizing weapons and ammunition.The battle lasted several hours.More than 20 people died,including civilians.A couple of days later,another Armenian unit managed to capture 155 flamethrowers and sent them to the Azerbaijanian border.On June 21st,1990,an Azerbaijanian Choban family from the Lachin region fell prey to the Armenian murderers.A father and his little son were shot point blank.Then,the Armenian soldiers cut off their victims' ears,tore out their tongues and gouged out their eyes.This brutality was witnessed in its entirety by the second son of the Choban,who managed to hide from the bandits.The leaders of the Azerbaijanians saw the results of this cruelty towards the Chobans.A few days later,Armenian soldiers from the "Oktyabrsky" Sovkhoz [Soviet collective farm] in the Kelbadjar region of Azerbaijan drove out a flock of sheep.Interior forces were able to force the leaders of the Vardenis region of Armenia to return the flock,which proves the connection between the mobs and the official administration of Armenia,which participated in the genocide against the Azerbaijanian people,too.Then the military established that in the area around the Armenian town of Zod,a unit of fighters named "Mstitel" ["avenger"] would be formed under the command of a certain Valera.It is very likely that the killing of the Azerbaijanian Chobans was their work.Why did these "avengers," or whoever they were,slay these Chobans? What did these supremely peaceful individuals do to them,being unarmed,helpless,far removed from any politics? Another Azerbaijanian Choban was killed near the town of Zeilik,and another two injured.Again,a large flock of heavy horned livestock was stolen.59 On a bridge not far from the village of Karaderesi,in the Shusha region of the NKAR,Armenian soldiers ambushed a unit of servicemen.Sudden,close-range gunfire shot up the Russian soldiers.Killed were Lieutenant-Colonel O.Larionov,Major I.Ivanov,[105-106] Sergeant I.Gosk.Their firearms were taken,and the ambushers disappeared.On July 11,1990,on the Mir-Bashir-Kelbadjarary road,in the Mardakert region of the NKAR,another Armenian band ambushed and shot up a convoy of passenger cars.A firefight ensued between the soldiers defending the convoy and the fighters.As a result of the Armenian attack,two Azerbaijanian civilians were killed,and Private S.Mezentsev.Twenty-three people were wounded.At the beginning of August,Armenian fighters sabotaged the rails of the inter-city bus between Tbilisi and Agdam.All the Azerbaijanian passengers aboard—24 persons—died.Soon afterwards,Lieutenant A.Lipatov,Private V Kirilov and 8 other soldiers were wounded in a firefight with Armenian fighters.On August 19,1990,a passenger bus in the Kazakh region of Azerbaijan was fired upon from the Noemberyan region of Armenia.Soldiers from the battalion under Lieutenant-Colonel S.Danilov evacuated 140 peaceful Azerbaijanian residents from the danger zone.All evidence pointed to the fact that the Armenian side was trying to ignite an all-out war with the aim of destroying the Azerbaijanian people.Subsequent events completely confirm this deduction.By the end of 1990,it became clear that the alliance between Gorbachev and the Armenians outlived its usefulness.The two sides needed each other only insofar as they could help each other attain their own goals.Mikhail Gorbachev desired bloody conflict between the Armenians and the Azerbaijanians in order to exploit the bloodshed spilt among the two peoples in order to establish a military dictatorship and to strengthen the Communist Party.Blood was spilt.Thousands dead and injured,hundreds of thousands of refugees.But a dictatorship was not established.More,the Communist Party practically ceased to exist,the Soviet Union was on the brink of dissolution,and its president was fast losing the remnants of any real power.Why did the Armenians need such an ally? They squeezed everything out of him that they could and threw him away like a used condom.Especially now that the Armenians had already mosly [106-107] achieved their goals:the Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomy was de facto annexed to Armenia.From the moment on,Gorbachev's path and that of the Armenians forked off.[107] 60 THE WAR OF 1992-1994 THE BLOODY SLAUGHTER IN KHODJALY By the beginning of 1991,the paralysis of the centralized Muscovite power was a given fact.The Kremlin's leaders did not know how to orient themselves to the new situation,wanted no changes,they did not know what lessons to glean from the mistakes already made and to make the right decisions.As a result,on January 12,Soviet troops seized a publishing house and a radio broadcasting committee headquarters in Vilnius.Again,there was bloodshed and 16 persons died.On January 13,Yeltsin appealed to the Russian soldiers and officers,asking that they not fight against the Baltic states.On January 20,divisions of Moscow's OMON (Department of Militia for Special Operations)stormed the Ministry of Internal Affairs building in Latvia anyway,but without success.Again,there was bloodshed and 5 dead.Now mass anti-government demonstrations were erupting held in Moscow and other cities.On February 9,a referendum was passed in Lithuania to withdraw from the USSR.On February 19,Yeltsin publicly demanded the dismissal of Gorbachev.On March 1,mine workers went on strike.After this,referenda were held on the [108-107] 61 Here is how Azerbaijanians were killed by the decapitators of the Armenian mobs and the foreign mercenaries they hired Meskhet Turks were killed together with Azerbaijanians.62 63 withdrawal of Latvia and Estonia from the USSR.On March 28,the authorities sent troops into Moscow for protection against the restless population.Then they were quickly withdrawn.On June 12 on,Yeltsin became the President of the RSFSR.On August 18-21 saw the "putsch" of the GKChP [Government Committee for the State of Emergency].On August 22,the Communist Party ceased to operate on the territory of the RSFSR.On August 24,Gorbachev conceded the duties of the General Secretary of the Communist Party.On September 1,Azerbaijan declared independence,along with Kyrghizia,Latvia,Moldavia,Uzbekistan,Ukraine and Estonia.On October 7,D.Dudaev seized power in Chechnya.On October 23,the KGB is disbanded.On December 8,the Belovezhskaya Agreement.On December 21,the USSR ceases to exist.On December 25,Mikhail Gorbachev handed over the reins of the Presidency.It is finished.The great sovereign power is no more.At about the same time in Azerbaijan:Abdurakhman Vezirov fled to Moscow.It was an emergency situation.Presidential elections were being prepared.There is conflict within the People's Front.Some of its leaders follow the lead of the regular Moscow marionette—A.Mutalibov.Parliamentary elections follow.Mutalibov's group takes power,and he becomes President.This former refrigerator factory director dreamed up for himself the role of great statesman.But the GKChP putsch exposed his incompetence:he tried to reanimate the Communist Party in Azerbaijan when it had long ago been rejected throughout the rest of the Soviet Union.Essentially,his fate was already sealed—the cowardly flight from the country at a time when his people bled under the blows of Armenian aggression.The genocide of the Azerbaijanian people,which did not abate for a minute,gained a new,stronger impetus.On September 2,1991,a session of the Nagorno-Karabakh Oblast Council was held in Stepanakert.Participating in it were representatives of the Shaumi-an Agricultural Regional Council of Azerbaijan.Together they adopted a declaration on the so-called Nagorno-Karabakh Republic—the NKR.Here for the first time,officially and directly,the Armenians gave notice that their territorial claims were not limited only to the former NKAR.They claimed the neighboring regions of Karabakh within the borders of Azerbaijan.[109-110] On December 10,1991,a "Republic-wide" referendum is held in NKR,the outcome of which could have been guessed—all its participants voted for the independence of the NKR.On December 28,elections were held for the Supreme Council of the NKR.On January 6,1992,this Council adopted a Declaration of State Independence of the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic.Artur Mkrtychian was elected President of the Supreme Council,and Oleg Esayan was confirmed as Chairman of the Council of Ministers.Regular military units were immediately formed.A Defense Headquarters were set up.This center began to supervise the 10 military companies and a few separate platoons,which comprised over 1,100 people.These military units immediately mobilized.On January 22,1992,in the city of Stepanakert (Khankiandy),a base camp of the OMON of the Azerbaijanian MVD was destroyed.Then,military actions were brought to towns with Azerbaijanian residents,Malibeili and Gushchiliar.On February 24,the Supreme Council of the self-declared Republic created a single command center for the new military forces.It is worth noting that from the very first moment,the leadership of Russia began supporting specifically Armenia in the Trans-Caucasus,because Georgia and Azerbaijan refused to join the CIS.According to the Tashkent Agreement of May 15,each of the Caucasus republics was to receive from the arsenals of the 19th Air Corps,the 19th Anti-Aircraft Defense unit,the 4th and 7th General Army Corps:210 tanks and armored vehicles,265 artillery pieces,and 50 fighter planes and helicopters.But Russia deceptively and secretly,unilaterally,without any consultations with anyone else,violated this exemplary balance of powers in the region.Russia "sold," but in actuality granted free of charge,to Armenia,along with the above,arms and ammunition at a value of approximately one billion dollars.So the material and technical foundations were laid for the continued genocide of the Azerbaijanian population by the Armenians.They were given a wide-open field in which to form and equip significant,well-armed military units.Included among the Russian gifts to Armenia were the following powerful and late-technology armaments such as:Strategic-tactical rocket launchers P-17 8 units Anti-aircraft "Krug" weapons 26 units [110-111] T-72 tanks.80 units Also:Machine guns 300 units Automatic weapons.7,600 units Pistols uncounted Shells.1,000,000 units Cartridges 220,000,000 units 64 In addition:Armed infantry vehicles.45 units "Grad" rocket launchers.20 units And a great deal of other military equipment.All this notwithstanding the fact that as a co-chair of the Minsk group on settling the Azerbaijanian-Armenian conflict,Russia should have abstained from such outrageous steps.At this time,the military forces quartered and designated for reassignment were given the recommendation of supporting the Armenian side.Using one of these very units,specifically,the 366th Motorized Sniper Regiment (consisting of 49 officers and warrant officers,who by this time were only Armenians and were led by the Trans-Caucasian military group,to wit,the Armenian Lieuten-ant-General Iosif Oganian),the Armenian militant units formed on February 25,1992,that is,on the day after the organization of a single command for the NKR,committed yet another act of genocide against the Azerbaijanian population in the city of Khodjaly.This town,with more than 7,000 residents,had recently become a city because of its growing population,its construction of residential housing and branch offices to accommodate employees of companies from Baku.Families of Azerbaijanians found succor in Khodjaly,those who had been expelled from Armenia during the ethnic cleansing of December 1988 and January 1989.Turkish-Meskhet families were also housed there who fled Soviet Central Asia,from Fergani.Meskhetites are descendants of the ethnic Georgians from Meskheti-Djavakheti,bordering Turkey,whom the Turks had forced to convert to Islam 3 centuries ago,under threat of destruction.After the beginning of World War II of 1941-45,they were exiled from their homes,since Turkey had become an ally of Germany,and the fear was that the Meskhet Muslims would spy for the Turks,meaning to the benefit of the Germans.[111-112] The emptied Meskhet-Turkish lands were immediately occupied by Armenians,who formed a launching pad within Georgia,surrounding the cities of Akhalkatsi and Akhlaklaki,for the future annexation to Armenia of these lands seized from Georgia.It was Georgia's own "Nagorno-Karabakh." Whether the Georgians suspect this or not,I don't know.In any case,the Armenians had long ago planted their representative in direct proximity to the President,M.Saakashvili.And when they begin to manifest their long-term plans,then the problems with Abkhazia and South Ossetia will seem to the Georgians to be some sort of mild misunderstanding in comparison.Meskhets were expelled into Central Asia,to Ferganu,where because of interethnic strife and mass killings during the unbridled period under Gorbachev,they were forced to flee again.A large portion of them settled in middle Russia.Then,when the land was freed up in the Krasnodarsk region,since the Crimean Tatars living there had returned to their homeland,the Meskhet Turks took their place.Later,in the Krasnodarsk area,the local Cossacks began persecuting the beating them.At the present time,the USA,in the form of a special program,is gradually resettling Meskhet Turks to the United States.But some percentage of the Meskhet Turks settled in the Azerbaijanian town of Khodjaly,where they shared the Azerbaijanians' bitter fate during the genocide at the hands of the Armenians.Armenians did not discern Azerbaijanian from Meskhet.The slaughtered everyone as they found them.Here is what a resident of Khodjaly,Sariya Talybova,who survived the horrors of the Armenian genocide,said:'.' We were led to an Armenian cemetery.Four young Meskhet Turks and 3 Azerbaijanians were sacrificed on the grave of an Armenian fighter.The poor men's heads were cut off.After this,the soldiers and fighters began to torture and kill the children right in front of their parents' eyes.Bulldozers pushed the corpses into a ditch.Not having spilt enough blood,these predators in human form brought up two Azerbaijanians wearing the National Army uniforms and gouged their eyes out with screwdrivers." From the testimony of eyewitnesses Mushfika Alimamedova,resident of Khodjaly; Minesh Aliyev,of Khodjaly; Elman Mamedov,head of the Executive Committee of the Khodjaly Municipal-[112-113]ity; Chingiz Mustafaev,correspondent of the Azerbaijanian television station; Sanubar Alekperova of Khodjaly; Djamil Mamedov of Khodjaly; the aforementioned Sariya Talybova; Djanana Orudjeva of Khodjaly; Private Yuri Yakhovich of the 366th Motorized Sniper Regiment; Jean-Yves Junet,French journalist; Khanlar Gadjiev,Head of Medical Services of the Azerbaijan Defense Ministry; V.Belykh,correspondent of Izvestia; Major Leonid Kravetz and other refugees and witnesses,it was possible to reconstruct the following picture of horror:At 10 pm on February 25,1992,Khodjaly was surrounded from all sides:Khankiandy,Askeran,Gasanabad,Mekhtikend and Bozdag were subjected to artillery fire which continued until midnight,that is,for two hours.At midnight,the city was stormed.In front were the heavy armored vehicles,behind them the Armenian infantry,together with soldiers of the CIS and mercenaries,among whom black Africans were seen.The city's defenders were able to hold up in their trenches for two hours.After this,the battle moved to the streets of the city and residential homes.This was followed by a mass exodus of civilians through the snowy woods in the direction of the city of Agdam.It was freezing cold.The stream of refugees continued all night,65 through the day of February 26,and only by the morning of the 27th of February,1992,did the first individuals of the 7,000 residents of Khodjaly have the good fortune of arriving at Agdam.Most of the refugees of Khodjaly were caught in ambushes previously set up by the Armenians at the town of Giulably,and primarily in the village of Nakhichevanik.They were subjected to mass shooting from automatic weapons and large-caliber machine-gun fire from tanks.Mountains of corpses began to appear.Those who survived were taken prisoner as hostages.Six hundred and thirteen people died in the Khodjaly tragedy.Armenian sources explained the large number of victims among the Khodjalyans as people killed by the Azerbaijanian artillery.And that the peaceful residents of Khodjaly were granted some sort of "humanitarian corridor" along which they could escape to safety.Here we are offered the words of A.Mutalibov,spoken on April 2nd,1992,in Nezavisimaya gazeta.Still,the Armenian side was still forced to admit the events in Khodjaly as a "criminal act," which was committed as a result of an attempt by the People's Front of Azerbaijan to overthrow A.Mutalibov.But what did the People's Front,the Azerbaijanian artillery and the "humanitarian corridor" have to do with this? These three factors,which the Armenian side hid behind to avoid culpability,has no connection with the scalping and tearing out of fingernails and toenails of living persons,the decapitations,the gouging out of eyes,the cutting off of ears,the mockery of corpses,the rape of women,the taking of even little children as hostages,the paganlike ritual killings of human beings,the robbing of prisoners,their being held in freezing cold without food and drink without warm clothing over the course of 4 days,and much else that is unfathom-able to the human mind.In Khodjaly,the Armenians showed the whole world a classic example of what Armenian "long-suffering" is,their "civilization," their Armenian "chosen-ness!" Here are but a few excerpts from the accounts of eyewitnesses of the Khodjaly GENOCIDE:'At midnight,armored vehicles arrived.Tanks and tank infantry destroyed houses and crushed people.At first they seized and destroyed the airport.They did not spare old men,women,or children." "Many people were burned inside their own homes,especially near the airport.There was a terrible stench of burnt flesh.Most of those who defended Khodjaly died fighting." "In the town of Nakhichevanik,men with automatic weapons,machine guns and armored vehicles were waiting in ambush.Many residents of Khodjaly were killed during the ambush at this town.The airport chief,Alif Gadjiev,did there,too,while running over to help some women caught in the ambush.The Armenians had long ago placed a price on his head.A mound of bodies began forming at the site of the ambush." "When the attack against the soldiers (presumably Russian)began,and the Armenian infantrymen had already destroyed everything in Khodjaly,many people died.they had to retreat.By 7 [114-115]o'clock in the morning,we emerged into the field near the town of Nakhichevanik." "Many people died on the road,in the forest,here they froze to death.young women and children died in convulsions in the snow." "Some of the people who escaped the ambush went to Agdam.Emerging from the gunfire,almost all of them were barefoot,their feet numb.Many were in danger of amputations." 'Almost 200 people were taken hostage in the town of Giulably." "Tens of people were shot:children aged 2-5 years old,women,old people.Most of them were killed by a point-blank shot in the head.The way the bodies lay bears witness to the fact that they were killed in cold blood,with premeditation,with no evidence of a struggle." "Some were killed after being led off to one side.many were killed,whole families all at once.several wounds were seen on dead bodies.One of these was always in the head.So the wounded were being finished off."Into the room were brought several murdered children with their ears cut off.The skin from the left side of an old woman's face was removed.Men were scalped.There were bodies that had clearly been robbed." "Near the town of Nikhichevanik,soldiers and fighters were showered with close-range gunfire.More than a few women and children were killed.My son was shot to death.He was 16 years old.My 23-year-old daughter and her twins and my second daughter,18 years old,pregnant,were taken from me.I plead with you to save them." 66 "On February 26th in the area of the Askeran Gates,are some 200 bodies,scattered all over the hill,in the midst of whom armed men roamed.We tried to take the bodies.A local police captain was [115-116] with us.He found his fourteen-year-old son there,his skull crushed,and he went mad." 'Another body of a child,whom we were able to pick up until they started shooting us,had his head cut off." "On February 28th,we saw a field from the air,with a radius of about 500 meters which was covered with dead bodies." "Pilots were afraid of landing on the territory controlled by Armenian fighters,but we landed anyway and emerged from the helicopter.Shooting started right away.The policemen with us had to load the corpses to take them to their relatives.They were only able to load 4 victims.And we were in genuine shock.Two children fainted from the sight of so many dead and mutilated bodies.Many were vomiting." "The same thing happened on March 2nd,when foreign journalists arrived.Many bodies were mutilated even more.They were mocked over the course of several days." "They took photos of what they saw around Khodjaly from a helicopter.But Armenians were shooting at our helicopter and we could not finish photographing.It was a horrible scene.I had heard a lot about war,on the cruelty of the German fascists,but the Armenians outdid them.They killed 5-and 6-year old children,of a peaceful populace." 'Armenians pulled out policemen,volunteer corps members,and would cut their heads off in front of everyone." "Young women being held prisoner.were raped,as a rule,and they did not a return.They were led aside right away and taken to an unknown place." ".All the volunteer doctors were preparing themselves for anything,but they were stunned:the corpses' eyes were gouged out,their ears cut off,they were scalped,decapitated.Chains of several corpses that were dragged for a long way behind armed vehicles.there was no end to the mockery." [117-118] Naturally,both the Armenian and Russian sides immediately began to take measures to hide the genocide against the Azerbaijanian population in Khodjaly.At first,access to the area of the troubles was enormously difficult.Special evacuation units who arrived there by helicopter to remove the masses of bodies and remains of the victims to return to their relatives for burial were shot at by armed Armenian fighters.Helicopters carrying foreign correspondents were also fired upon.The head of the unified forces of the CIS,Air Marshall E.Shaposhnikov,hastened to conceal the 366lh Motorized Sniper Regiment and on February 28,h,issued an order for its removal from the territory of Nagorno-Karabakh,in order to sweep Russian involvement in the inhuman brutality against the Khodjaly populace— ethnic Azerbaijanians and Meskhet Turks-under the rug.As if by command,the Russian and Armenian press and a series of high-level officials began to deny the genocide in Khodjaly.There was nothing of the sort,they said.All this is hearsay,rumors spread by the Azerbaijanians.Here are examples of the press of the time:Krasnaya zvezda [Red Star],a Russian Department of Defense newspaper,in its March 4th,1992,issue,wrote:" [I]n some of the mass media,the old ponderings are reappearing of the participation of military figures,including the 366th Regiment,in the military actions between the Karabakh Defense and the Azerbaijanian militant groups.In particular,this is connected with the events of February 26-27 in the Khodjaly area.The Press Center of the Unified Military Forces of the CIS categorically denies such notions,which have no foundation in truth.such disinformation.bears an obvious provo-cational character." Moskovskiye novosti of March 16,1992,wrote " I did not see soldiers of the 366th Motorized Sniper Regiment during the storming of Khodjaly,but the army armored vehicles and artillery fire which preceded the attack I saw with my own eyes." R.Arakelov,diplomat from Armenia:'.' [T]alk about the destruction of Khodjaly is no more than propaganda by Azerbaijan." Pro-Armenia Agency:'.' [Military actions did not last long.In the actual town,there were no victims among the residents of Azerbaijanian nationality." O.Kazaryan,member of the Armenian Parliament,on March 3rd,1992:"Particularly notable is the clear effort to juxtapose two [117-118] events:the Armenian pogroms in Sumgait and the tragedy in Khodjaly.It was the Azerbaijanian forces that hindered the peaceful population from leaving their surroundings unharmed." 67 (If the reader noticed,the Armenians recognized what happened in Khodjaly as a "tragedy^ As for juxtaposing Sumgait and Khodjaly,then this is at the very least silly,because they are simply incomparable—Khodjaly is 23 Sumgaits at once! ITAR-TASS,citing the independent journalist I.Burgansky:'.' Reports of the brutal Armenians in the town of Khodjaly do not correspond with reality." In any case,the Khodjaly tragedy has already been forgotten by the world.At the same time,the Armenians continued their genocide of the Azerbaijanian people.This genocide became a main and inseparable part of the Armenian aggression against Azerbaijan.All casual references some "Karabakh armed forces" are without basis.Nagorno-Karabakh was annexed to Armenia,tens of thousands of ethnic Azerbaijanians were driven out of there,its remaining population of ethnic Armenians received citizenship of Armenia,its field commander became the President of Armenia.On May 8-9,the Armenian Army began the assault on the city of Shusha,a heavily-populated center with an Azerbaijanian population in one of the regions of Nagorno-Karabakh.At first,the seized control over the main highway between Lachin and Shusha.After this,from the east and the north,the Armenian Army approached the outskirts of Shusha and instigated street battles.By May 9th,Shusha was in the hands of the Armenians.On May 18,Armenian forces seized the Azerbaijanian regional center,the city of Lachin.In this way,the genocide against the Azerbaijanian populace assumed a new quality.Before,the Armenian side conducted it on the territory of Armenia (243,000 ethnic Azerbaijanians driven into exile),and in the inseparable part of the Azerbaijanian state—the territory of Nagorno-Karabakh (60,000 exiled ethnic Azerbaijanians).Now,after the seizure of the city of Lachin and its outlying regions,the Armenian Army and all those who conducted it,equipped and armed it,moved the genocide onto the territory of sovereign Azerbaijan,which was a member of the United Nations.This required not only resources,but manpower.That is why on June 18,in the self-declared NKR,a state of [118-119] emergency was declared and all men age 18 to 40 were mobilized,and women,too,for which they were given special training.On August 12,war was declared.Now.men up to the age of 45 were mobilized,and officers until the age of 50.On August l5,a State Defense Committee was established.Robert Kocharian (now the Armenian President)was appointed the Head of the SDC,and was given full,absolute power.The Armenian Army was re formed.By November 1992,the Armenian Army took control of the Kelbadjarary-Mardakert highway.In February,the Armenians seized the Sarsang Hydroelectric Station and the Sarsang Reservoir.After this,the Armenian Army concentrated in its hands the threat of terrible,destructive power:if the dam were blown up,many level areas of Azerbaijan and their populations would be destroyed.The resulting carnage could only be compared to the effects of weapons of mass destruction.From March 27th,1993,the seizure of the Kelbadjar region of Azerbaijan began.In July 1993,Armenian forces occupied the strategically-important position of the Agdam region.On July 23,Agdam was taken.After this,the Armenians launched an assault in the direction of the towns of Kubatly,Djebrail and Fizuli.On August 22,the regional center of Fizuli was occupied,and a day later,the regional center of Djebrail.On August 31,the forces of Armenia entered Kubatly.On October 24,the city of Goradiz was taken,and on November 1st,Zangelan.At the same time the regions in Azerbaijan of the same names were also subjected to Armenian control.[119] 68 A HUMANITARIAN CATASTROPHE After the massive onslaught of the Armenian forces and the occupation of practically a fifth of the territory of Azerbaijan,the genocide against the Azerbaijanian people in discrete regions turned into a genocide against all the Azerbaijanian people,which grew to the scale of a humanitarian catastrophe.Significant destruction was wrought in places far from the Karabakh area,in the Kazakh.Kedebek,Akstafin regions and in the Nakhichevan Autonomous Region.The number of dead among civilians,women,old men and children was approximately 20,000.over 60,000 wounded,of whom 6,068 persons became permanent invalids.Five thousand two hundred fifty-two children were orphaned,their parents killed by the Armenian occupiers.Disappearing without a trace were 4,968 people,including 320 women,358 old men and 71 children.Wide swaths of territory were transformed by the Armenians into a "dead zone." Over one million refugees,fleeing from their native homes,sought salvation from death from the Armenian Army.By experts' accounts,because of the aggressive actions of the Armenian Army,876 populated centers were burned and de-stroyed,including regional centers,some 7,000 industrial and agri-[120-121] 69 Refugees Armenian thieves and their allies drove out over a million Azerbaijanians from their homes,and Azerbaijanian lands are now occupied by Armenian colonists.Will any force be found to end Armenian expansion? 70 71 cultural enterprises,153,000 residential homes and apartments,the overall area of which was about 9,000,000 square meters in size.Four thousand three hundred sixty-six cultural centers,898 schools,240 pre-schools,395 medical clinics,11 hospitals,10 old persons' homes,76 pharmacies,4 health centers and ten mosques.Sixty-five percent of summer pastures were lost.Hydrotechnical constructions were rendered useless,the railroads suffered disruptions,1,800 kilometers of vehicular roads were destroyed,160 bridges,145,000 kilometers of power lines,2,300 kilometers of water mains,2,000 kilometers of gas lines.The Armenian occupation took 72,000 hectares of arable land,5,500 hectares of orchards and vineyards in the areas of Kubatlin,Kelbadjar,Zangelan,Lachin,Agdam,Djebrail and Fizuli In the above-named regions,around 60,000 heads of large cattle and 245,000 sheep were lost because of the military actions.The Armenian occupation covered approximately 1,000,000 hectares of agricultural land and 250,000 hectares of unique forests which had previously been under state protection.In Nagorno-Karabakh,many establishments revered by Azerbaijanian culture as holy sites were destroyed.In addition,the territory taken by Armenia included hundreds of important faunal,geological and paleontological sites.The damage is estimated at over 60 billion US dollars; for the entire city of Shusha was destroyed,this was virtually an open-air museum.Cultural treasures were looted,long considered the property of the Azerbaijanian people.Three hundred fifty-six clubs,915 libraries,85 music conservatories,several art galleries,recreational parks and 6 theaters.In more than twenty museums,approximately 40,000 items were looted,including items of world importance,rugs,gold and silver artifacts,precious stones and much else.Burned along with the libraries were about 5 million books and manuscripts,many of which were invaluable.Twenty contemporary palaces of culture were destroyed After the coming to power of Geidar Aliyev in 1994,no small effort was expended in resolving the conflict peacefully.The aggressive actions of the Armenians were recorded by many official international institutions:the United Nations,the Organization for Security and Co-operation of Europe,the US State Department and others.[121-122] The United Nations adopted several resolutions:Nos.822,852,874 and 884,which condemned the actions of Armenia and proposing the immediate withdrawal of Armenian occupational forces from all seized Azerbaijanian territories,and to return the refugees to their homes,to their native hearths.The Organization for Security and Co-operation of Europe has been active.At the Lisbon Summit of 1995,the following 3 principles were adopted and proposed to the two sides in the conflict:l.The territorial integrity of Azerbaijan and Armenia.2.The observance of broad autonomy for the NKAR within Azerbaijan.3.The guarantee of the security of the population of the NKAR.In 1997,the proposals of the Co-President of the Minsk Conference of the OSCE on the manifestation of a two-step peace process were adopted:1.The withdrawal of Armenian occupational forces from all territories seized,both in the NKAR and other regions of Azerbaijan and the return of the refugees to their homes.2.Negotiations for the determination of a final status of the NKAR within Azerbaijan.Yet the Armenian side blocked the execution of these decisions and proposals of the international organizations on the peaceful resolution of the Azerbaijanian-Armenian conflict.Moreover,Armenia undertook numerous steps inconsistent with the peace process,and strangely enough,one of the Co-Presidents of the Minsk Conference —Russia—is actively helping.A twenty-five year agreement on military cooperation between Russia and Armenia was concluded.Russian continues to supply Armenia with the latest weapons,and also C-300 rocket systems and MIG-29 fighter jets,not counting the aforementioned 1 billion dollars worth of illegal deliveries of weapons,without which the Armenian aggression against the Azerbaijanians would have simply been impossible.Russia continues to support several military bases on the territory of Armenia and is taking measures to reorganize and expand them.Besides,Russia is undertaking concrete steps to include China in the delivery of weapons to Armenia.It is through Russia's intercession that China has begun to sell Armenia "Typhoon" rocket systems.[122-123] Relying on the military cooperation of these two world powers,Armenia,in violation of the Geneva Convention of 1949,is proceeding with settling the seized Azerbaijanian territories with Armenian colonists.On November 23,2004,the General Assembly of the UN began studying this matter.Armenia stubbornly rejects the peaceful resolution of the military conflict,which has place Azerbaijan on the brink of a national catastrophe.But the Armenians should not fool themselves.The state of war and its genocide against the Azerbaijanian people during this slice of history has turned these events for the Azerbaijanian people into a 72 mission for freedom.And if peaceful means provide no results,there is no doubt that the Azerbaijanian people will find the resources,along with the help of allies and friendly nations,to decide this mission through military means.Of course,no one wants this.In this case,obviously,no one will consider any kind of Armenian autonomy within the borders of Azerbaijan.The present population of the NKAR,instead of being left alone,will have to move to the territory of Armenia.The myopia of the present Armenian leadership,as it has been in past history,will play a cruel trick against them.But not against them,really,not the leaders,but against the Armenian people,who have how many times in the last hundred years already been sacrificed by their leaders.Reliance on Russia's help is illusory,and hope for China's help is simply laughable.Russia,as a world power,led in its external politics by the unchanging principle voiced at one time by British diplomats:'.' We have no permanent friends,only permanent interests." Armenian leaders during the First World War ignored this fact and its practical application,and as a result were rewarded with the tragedy of 1915.It would seem time to learn the lessons of past mistakes.Armenian leaders both present and future should cease committing such "thefts." They must stop putting the Armenia people,their women and children under danger of reprisal from the other side and must end the exploitation of their compatriots as hostages in seeking their irresponsible and impossible goals.[123-124] The creation of a so-called "Great Armenia" as the unification of a "Western Armenia" and "Eastern Armenia," a "Southern Armenia" with a "Northern Armenia" is a utopia.It is time to stop bandying about hollow terms.Those who play this dishonest game know perfectly well:there is not now nor was there ever before a «Western,» «Eastern» «North-ern» or «Southern» Armenia.Listen at least to the words of your own competent countryman:«Today's leadership seeks a future Armenian state where there never was one in our history.* (David Shakhnazarian).Why falsify history and conceal the truth from one's own people? There was an Armenia in Asia Minor from the 6th century BC until 428 AD as a province of Rome,of Parfia and of Persia and existed under the Armenian kings in the capacity of vassal states of these empires.Efforts to reanimate the Armenian kingdom in the 9th,11th,12th and 14th centuries within the borders of Eastern Turkey and Kilikiya proved fruitless.In our time,the Lord granted you territory in the borders of the established boundaries of the former Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic,and you live there in peace.For the ways of the Lord are unknowable:as He takes,so He may take away.Think about this and do not tempt either the Lord (may His name not be taken in vain!)nor your neighbors.Personally,I pray that no more blood is spilled,not Azerbaijanian,not Armenian.May God help us! Amen.Amen.Amen.[124] 73 IN PLACE OF AN AFTERWORD While this book was being prepared for publication,the newspaper V novom svete printed an item on the events of 1915 in Turkey.The heading,using a feigned street jargon,was "Genocide of Swindlers," taking up a half a column and with the by-line of the by-now-familiar E.Parian.His article continues the chain of odious reports in the manner of Ms Levinson and Mr Stupnikov,which I already wrote about,methodically promoted in the Russian-language information market of our country.Using the commonplace method used in America,Mr Parian allowed himself,in a veiled manner,to address this message to the American government,which looks like blackmail:".A million or so Armenian-Americans is a pretty powerful lobby.Meaning,we were able to obtain Congressional help "with 42 dollars per person" in Armenia,and we'll achieve recognition of the Armenian genocide.(It is baffling why Armenians are constantly put in first place.One can name tens or hundreds of examples when a nation suffered much worse than the Armenians.The no-less-ancient Gauls,for example,whom Caesar slaughtered by the million every year.Or the Phoenicians who have disappeared [125-126] forever from the face of the earth.And why not the Copts,whose church is called the "million martyrs of Christ?" Finally,the Belarussians,who lost one of every four compatriots in 1944 by Hitler's forces during World War II.Why the Armenians? Why,only because they have their own lobby? What of those who have no lobby? (The Azerbaijanians,for example.)The same Mr Parian offers the American government a deal that sounds like a bribe:«Armenians would eagerly exchange all these dollars for an official recognition of genocide.» Interesting proposal,isn't it? To pay the American government American dollars for the very doubtable Armenian interests.Does the White House know,or the Capitol,of this enticing offer? Despising all convention,the article's author forges ahead,equating the Holocaus of the Jews with the unrecognized genocide of Armenians.This is how much he lusts to identify himself not only to Jewish glory and Jewish authority,but even to Jewish sorrow.Only one small question.Does Mr Parian know that in the very centre of Yerevan,there is,lying right on the ground,a forgotten,un-needed memorial to the victims of the Holocaust? Its rotten foundation is the best testimony of the attitude of the Armenians to the Jews in general,and to the Holocaust specifically.So he should pull this Armenian wool over the eyes of the Russian-language audience,this Mr Parian.Everyone already knows that your newspaper regularly publishes such «wool,» and plenty of it.Do you want an example? By all means.In the period between January 28 and February 3,2005,V novom svete,through your words,states that Armenia is in second place,after Israel,in receiving American material aid by population count.And in January 21-27,2005,the same newspaper,under the same editor,names Georgia as the recipients of this aid per population count.Another example.In V novom svete of January 28-February 3,2005,there is a small item,'Armenians in Iraq," on the mobilization of an insignificant number (46!)of Armenians to Iraq.In connection with this,the Defense Minister of Armenia,Mr Serge Sarkisian (if you believe this account)spoke out with the request for the international society to remove the blockade from the borders in re-[126-127] turn for Armenian aid in Iraq.One automatically thinks of the old Albanian adage:A mouse pissed in the sea and boasts of its luck!" The military theater,where both sides are employing hundred of thousands of armed troops,there are 46 (!)Armenians under the command of a Polish general fighting for Uncle Sam,and they immediately demand that a blockade be liften in the Southern Caucasus.If one talks about lifting a blockade,it is worth reminding Mr Sarkisian and the international society to whom he appeals:Armenian occupying forces under his command are for eleven years already (!)unlawfully occupying a fifth of the sovereign territory of Azerbaijan,having first exterminated over 20,000 peaceful Azer-baijanian citizens and driving about a million Azerbaijanians from their homes,turning them into refugees in their own country.Shouldn't we talk about this problem instead? And more.These 46 Armenians (called upon,of course,to finally decide all of America's problems in Iraq)in a note on the fourth line from the top,are called a "humanitarian contingent," and in the last paragraph of the same article,these very same 46 Armenians are called "contingent soldiers." So are they soldiers or hu-manitarian workers? As they say in Mother Odessa,"those are two big differences!" Let us return to 1915.It was the time of World War I.Turkey was fighting on three fronts:against the British in Mesopotamia,against the Russians on the Eastern front and between the fronts with Armenian rebels who had sparked a civil war.Besides,in the rear of the Russian Army,having seized Kars,Erzerum,Trabazon 74 and other Turkish provinces,armed Armenian groups had unleashed a wave of terror against the Muslim population.The Turkish commander-in-chief asked the Russian military command to cease acts of violence against the civilian population.So things are not at all that simple.Where there casualties among the Armenian populace? Without a doubt,there were.But do all losses qualify as genocide? Was it genocide on the part of the Armenians against the ethnic Turks,Kurds and Georgians in the rear of the Russian forces? I will try to answer these and other questions in by next book.Until we meet again,dear readers,on those pages.May peace and God's mercy be with all of you!
