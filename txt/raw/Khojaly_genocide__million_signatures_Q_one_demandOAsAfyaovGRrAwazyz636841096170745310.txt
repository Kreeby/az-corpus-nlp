Khojaly genocide: million signatures – one demand
The heroic and brave sons and daughters of our
nation became martyrs in the battles for our land. But 
the Khojaly tragedy occupies a special place in 
history. On the one hand, it is the example of 
devotion of Khojaly residents to their land, nation and 
Motherland and on the other hand, it is the 
unprecedented massacre committed by nationalist 
and barbarian forces of Armenia against Azerbaijan. 
Therefore, every year, we commemorate the 
anniversary of Khojaly genocide.

Khojaly genocide: million signatures – one demand
Preface
The genocide of Azerbaijani nation in Khojaly town became 
one  of  the  most  tragic  events  of  the  Nagorno-Karabakh  conflict, 
which had been ideologically,  politically and military prepared for 
many  years  by  Armenian  nationalist  circles  and  later  on, 
implemented against Azerbaijan.  This crime, committed against the 
humanity by Armenian militants together with the 366th Motorized 
Regiment of Soviet Army resulted in severe massacre. Hundreds of 
peaceful  citizens  were  wounded,  tortured,  missing  and  taken 
prisoner. During this criminal operation carried out by professional 
military units, the fundamental principles of human rights, as well as 
rules and morality of war were broken. The town was blockaded at 
night  without  any  notification.  According  to  a  punctilious  and 
barbarously worked out plan, false “corridors” were left for the civil 
population. The militants positioned in ambushes on both sides of the 
“corridors”  shot  peaceful  and  defenseless  people  at  point-blank 
range. 
Almost 15 years has passed since the Khojaly slaughter, but 
unfortunately,  this  event  standing  amongst  the Holocaust,  Songmi 
and Khatin tragedies and witnessed by foreign journalists,  has not 
been worthy estimated by the international community. Though the 
Milli  Majlis  (Parliament)  of  the  Azerbaijan  Republic  adopted  a 
decision on the day of Khojaly genocide,  we should acknowledge 
that  the  measures  taken  were  insufficient  for  the  recognition  of 
Kojaly genocide in the international scene. President Ilham Aliyev 
said: “The years passed since the Khojaly genocide proved that our 
nation  and  society  should  be  vigilant  and  unmask  the  plans  of 
Armenians  who  have  a  great  experience  in  disinformation  and 
provocation.  The  ethnic  separatism  of  Armenian  nationalists  in 
Caucasus and the danger of ideology of hatred and terror towards 
other nations should be revealed. We have much work to do in this 
www.avciya.az- 4 -

sphere.  Bringing  the  truth  about  Azerbaijan  realities  to  the  entire 
world should be our primary goal and implemented more efficiently 
and systematically”. 
Association  for  Civil  Society  Development  in  Azerbaijan 
declared 2006 year  as the year  of Karabakh. The Association has 
done much work in this regard, prepared and published the book of 
historical realities in Azeri, English and Russian titled “The Khojaly 
genocide  (in  documents,  facts  and  foreign  media)”  and  spread  it 
within Azerbaijan and all over the world. In 2006, the Association 
started the mass campaign of collecting signatures under the demand 
to  recognize  internationally  the  Khojaly  genocide  by  the  world 
community. As a result, 1 million signatures of Azerbaijan citizens 
were collected. 
Taking an opportunity, I would like to appreciate thousands 
of volunteers who selflessly joined the initiative of the Association 
and took part in the process of signature collection, as well as all the 
fellow citizens who affixed their signatures under the document. 
I  also  want  to  note  that  these  signatures  are  not  only  the 
simple demand. They are at the same time the documents of moral 
and political and historical-legal vivid evidence of the people who 
witnessed  the  Khlojaly  genocide.  Just  these  signatures  are  to  be 
spread among the largest  libraries  and archives  of Azerbaijan and 
foreign countries, including the central libraries of France, Germany, 
Great Britain and Belgium, as well as the library of US Congress and 
the  UNO,  OSCE,  EU,  CE,  International  Criminal  Court,  etc.  We 
believe they will contribute to the restoration of peace and justice. 
The  process  of  signature  collection  has  shown once  again 
how painful and actual for our nation the Khojaly genocide problem 
is. It also proved the need for pursuing greater activity in this area. 
This new book introduced to readers is the result of this need. 
The book includes the official documents on the Nagorno-Karabakh 
conflict  and  Khojaly  genocide;  the  arguments  confirming  the 
violation of the international law; the facts of crime and slaughter 
www.avciya.az- 5 -

against the humanity; analytical explanations, real observations and 
other documents. The materials used in the book cover the policy of 
ethnic purge and terror actions implemented by Armenian chauvinist 
forces against Azerbaijanis since the beginning of last century; mass 
deportation  of  Azerbaijan  people  from  Armenia;  the  analytical 
comments of international organizations regarding the recognition of 
Khojaly genocide and other historical-legal documents. 
Our  basic  aim  is  to  inform  the  world  about  the  voice  of 
justice of a million of our citizens and help the Milli Majlis with the 
restoration of our rights, move forward to the recognition of Khojaly 
genocide  by  the  international  organizations  and  parliaments  of 
foreign states and seek after deserved punishment of the criminals. 
We are confident that recognition of Khojaly genocide as the matter 
of both historical-legal and moral-political responsibility will prevent 
the similar tragedies in the future.

APPEAL TO THE NATION ON
THE ANNIVERSARY OF 
KHOJALY GENOCIDE
 
Dear fellow-countrymen!
Dear compatriots! 
I  am addressing you today on the occasion of the Khojaly 
genocide, the painful and bitter page in the history of our people, and 
one  of  the  most  brutal  and  merciless  mass  terrorist  acts  against 
humanity.  On 26 February 1992, our nation experienced one of the 
heaviest  and sorrowful  moments  in  its  fate.  That  day,  the ancient 
Azerbaijani town of Khojaly was razed to the ground by Armenian 
armed  forces.  Without  any  necessity  to  use  military  force,  they 
subjected  thousands  of  peaceful  residents  including  children,  old 
people and women to tortures, and killed them with unprecedented 
cruelty. 
At  the  end of  the  20th  century,  one  of  the  gravest  crimes 
targeted to not only Azerbaijani people but also the whole mankind 
was committed. The Khojaly tragedy occupies a special place among 
crimes against humanity as one of the most brutal and merciless. 
The Khojaly tragedy was not an accidental  event.  It  was a 
part  of  the  policy  of  genocide  and  ethnic  purge  pursued  by 
aggressive  Armenian  nationalists  against  Azerbaijani  people  over 
twenty hundred years. Supported by Armenian lobby, this policy was 
pursued at all times by military, economic, ideological and cultural 
means. 
At  the  end of  80s  of  the last  century,  Armenian  territorial 
claims  led  to  a  large-scale  military  conflict.  As  a  result  of  this 
guileful  policy,  Azerbaijanis  were  ousted  from their  native  lands, 
with  hundreds  of  thousands  of  people  becoming  refugee  and 
internally displaced. 
www.avciya.az- 7 -
Khojaly genocide: million signatures – one demand
By committing the monstrous Khojaly crime, the Armenians 
were purposing far-reaching tactical aims.  That was their attempt to 
intimidate our people, undermine their fighting spirit and make them 
put  up  with  loss  of  our  historical  lands.  However,  the  insidious 
enemy failed to reach the goal. 
Our nation has become even more steadfast in the fight for 
sovereignty and territorial integrity of the state by demonstrating a 
true courage and heroism. 
In spite of large scale and heaviness of the tragedy, those who 
were  in  power  at  that  time  did  not  timely  informed  international 
organizations and global community about this bloody crime, they 
did not sound the alarm, on the contrary, having been frightened of 
the people's anger and loss of power, they concealed the truth from 
the nation. Meanwhile, those who were in opposition took advantage 
of the nation-wide sorrow to come to power. 
Only after Heydar Aliyev came to power, this bloody crime 
was given a political and legal appraisal, and measures directed to its 
recognition  as  genocide  by  the  world  states  and  international 
organizations were taken. 
Today,  the  leadership  of  Azerbaijan  is  making  successive 
efforts  aimed  at  settlement  of  the  Armenia-Azerbaijan,  Nagorno-
Karabakh conflict in accordance with the principles of international 
law, restoration of territorial integrity and sovereignty of our country, 
return of refugees and internally displaced people to their homes. 
International  organizations,  as  well  as  the  world's  leading 
countries  are  now much better  informed on the  roots,  causes  and 
consequences  of  the  conflict,  and  recognize  fair  position  of 
Azerbaijan.  Today,  the  Khojaly  tragedy  is  discussed  by  those 
countries'  parliaments  and  public.  A  number  of  international 
organizations,  leaders and parliaments of influential  states confirm 
that  Armenia  is  a state-aggressor,  and urge the country to  release 
occupied Azerbaijan territories.

Khojaly genocide: million signatures – one demand
The  experience  gained  over  the  years  passed  since  the 
Khojaly tragedy shows that  our  people  and public  of  the country 
should be watchful to unmask plans of the Armenians who are very 
well experienced in spreading misinformation and taking provocative 
steps. It is necessary to unmask and demonstrate the threat of ethnic 
separatism and ideology of hatred and terror towards other nations 
pursued  by  Armenia  and  Armenian  nationalists  in  the  Caucasian 
region posed to the whole humanity. 
We  have  much  to  do  in  this  sphere.  We  should  more 
effectively and successively bring the truth about Azerbaijan to the 
world.  Our  compatriots,  who  are  gradually  strengthening  their 
positions  abroad,  must  take  direct  and  active  part  in  this  matter 
striving for adequate evaluation of the events like Khojaly genocide 
in the countries of their residence. 
I  believe  that  existence  and  gradual  development  of 
independent,  powerful  and  democratic  Azerbaijan  may serve as  a 
tribute to the memory of Khojaly shehids (martyrs). 
I want once again to commemorate heroes and shehids from 
Khojaly - may Allah rest their souls in peace - and offer my deepest 
condolence to the people of Azerbaijan.

APPEAL
To the UN Security Council
To the Active Chairman of OSCE
To the Parliamentary Assembly of Council of Europe
To the US Congress
To the Parliament of Great Britain
To the Parliament of France
To the State Duma of Russian Federation
To the Great Milli Majlis of Turkey
To the Parliaments of World states
Armenian  armed  forces  and  separatist  terrorist  groups  of 
Nagorno Karabakh of Armenian origin carried out the unprecendent 
Khojaly genocide against Azerbaijan nation with the help of 366th 
Motorized  Infantry  Regiment  of  former  USSR,  located  in 
Khankandy, on the night of 25 February, 1992. Armenians inflicted 
violent reprisals to the population of Khojaly. Hundreds of people, 
including  the  aged,  women  and  children  were  brutally  murdered, 
captured  and  taken  hostage.  The  town was  looted.  The  offenders 
prevented  Khojaly  population  from  leaving  the  town  during  the 
invasion. Horrible shots, recorded by teleoperators several days after 
the event and reports of local and foreign journalists made the world 
feel deep sorrow. Thus, tens of corpses of aged people, women, and 
children were scalped and their bodies were cut to pieces. Their faces 
were  disfigured  by  bullets  and  butts  of  submachine  guns.  These 
murderous acts reveal the real essence of “Armenians’ right to self-
determination”. 
Being  a  new  stage  of  purposeful  reactionary  policy  of 
Armenian  invaders  against  the  state  independence  and  territorial 
integrity  of  the  Azerbaijan  Republic,  this  mass  and  inhuman 
massacre will remain the black spot in the history of mankind with 
its inadmissible brutality and inhuman methods. 
www.avciya.az- 10 -
Khojaly genocide: million signatures – one demand
Contradictory  to  mental  and  religious  values  and  alien  to 
military principles morality formed for thousand years, the Khojaly 
genocide  directed  to  the  annihilation  of  peaceful  population  is 
considered the greatest and the most horrible tragedy of mankind at 
the end of last century.  The echo of Khojaly tragedy as an act of 
genocide will sound in the ears over history. The Khojaly tragedy is 
also a bloody page of ethnical purge and genocide policy conducted 
by Armenian nationalists against our nation. 
People,  applying  inadmissible  violence  against  peaceful 
Azerbaijani  population  during  invasion  of  Khojaly  and  roughly 
breaking the requirements of the Geneva Convention (articles 2, 3, 5, 
9) and 17 of the “General Declaration on human rights”, as well as 
the  Declaration  on  the  Protection  of  Women  and  Children  in 
Emergency and Armed Conflict and the Convention on ”Prevention 
and  Punishment  of  Crime  of  Genocide”  have  not  suffered 
punishment up to now. Moreover, the feeling of impunity creates the 
ground for new crimes.   
Armenia does not deviate from the committed atrocities, on 
the  contrary,  it  boldly  justifies  the  genocide  committed  against 
Azerbaijanis.  Besides, people who had committed this  tragedy are 
posed as national heroes. Evident anti-Azerbaijani policy is pursued 
in Armenia. Ideological grounds are established on a world scale for 
invasion of new Azerbaijan territories. Falsified Armenian history is 
raised to  the level  of state  policy to create  background for young 
Armenians’ chauvinist spirit. 
We call on Armenia to meet elementary legal norms, keep the 
feeling of reality and make steps towards acceptable alternatives of 
the conflict settlement.  President of the Azerbaijan Republic Ilham 
Aliyev  states  that  negotiations  can  not  continue  endlessly:  “We 
should  do  everything  for  recognition  and  denouncement  by 
parliaments of the world states and international organizations of the 
aggression and genocide against Azerbaijani nation by Armenians…
We want  to  live  in  peace,  develop  our  country,  restore  historical 
www.avciya.az- 11 -
Khojaly genocide: million signatures – one demand
justice and reality, as well as gain acknowledgment and unmask the 
people, implementing the invasion and genocide policy”. 
Terrorism became the strategy number 1 of political tactics of 
Armenian  state  and  besides,  it  turned  from  methodology  into 
ideology in XX century. We do not doubt that this issue will be soon 
disclosed at the highest tribunes of the global world. The names of 
Armenian  terrorist  organizations  and  their  crimes  will  be  cited 
among international terrorist organizations. 
Today,  the  Azerbaijan  administration  is  making  systematic 
efforts  for  settlement  of  Armenian-  Azerbaijan Nagorno-Karabakh 
conflict,  restoration  of  territorial  integrity  and  sovereignty  of  the 
country and repatriation of refugees and IDPs to their native land due 
to international legal norms.  International organizations and leading 
states are increasingly informed on roots, reasons and results of the 
conflicts  and  support  fair  position  of  Azerbaijan.  Today,  Khojaly 
tragedy  is  discussed  in  the  parliaments  of  leading  states  and  its 
details  are  being  clarified  to  the  global  community.  A number  of 
international organizations, leaders and parliaments of authoritative 
states confirm that Armenia is an invasive and aggressor state and 
they demand to quit the invaded Azerbaijani territories. 
Life,  history  and  the  reality  of  passed  years  helps  us  to 
conclude  that,  pain  of  any  nation  exposed  to  terror  and  disaster 
should alarm all the people settled in various corners of the world 
independently  of  a  place  they  live,  religion  they  practice,  and 
language  they  speak.  They should  grieve  equally  with  the  nation 
exposed to genocide and struggle together to eliminate this terrible 
disaster. 
We  should  note  that,  the  Association  for  Civil  Society 
Development  in  Azerbaijan  uniting  tens  of  leading  non-
governmental organizations collected in 2006 the signatures of one 
million citizens of the Azerbaijan Republic demanding recognition 
of Khojaly events as a genocide act. Taking them into consideration, 
we – ASSOCIATION FOR CIVIL SOCIETY DEVELOPMENT IN 
www.avciya.az- 12 -
Khojaly genocide: million signatures – one demand
AZERBAIJAN  request  you  to  render  us  assistance  in 
acknowledgement of Khojaly massacre – the malicious tragedy and 
bright sample of Armenian vandalism - as genocide.  We bring to 
your  notice  that  no  state  is  insured from terror  and  such kind of 
genocide  by  a  state,  practicing  terror  and  aggression  to  its  state 
policy. Therefore, it is very important to give even belated evaluation 
of  the  genocide  committed  in  Khojaly.  It  will  relatively  console 
hundreds  of  disabled  people  and those who lost  their  relatives  in 
Khojaly and serve as warning for other states supporting aggression.

Khojaly genocide: million signatures – one demand
KHOJALY
February 26, 1992 seemed like a regular working day. Iranian 
Foreign Minister  Ali  Akbar  Velayati  was  back in  town to  finally 
bestow diplomatic recognition on Azerbaijan, as well as to respond 
to American Secretary of State James Baker's recent comments about 
the growing threat of Iranian influence in the Caucasus and Central 
Asia. 
It was not the Islamic Republic of Iran that posed any threat 
to  the  region,  intoned  the  wiry  Iranian  emissary,  but  the  United 
States America.  In addition to being the country responsible for the 
continued  bloodshed  throughout  the  world,  it  was  the  US  that 
actively  fomented  conflict  in  Karabakh.  The  Islamic  Republic,  in 
contrast,  was  a  country  interested  in  peace  between  nations  and 
peoples. To that end, Dr. Velayati had brought a peace plan for the 
increasingly bloody and senseless conflict in Karabakh-and one both 
Armenia and Azerbaijan had agreed to sign. He himself planned to 
visit Karabakh the next day. 
This was newsworthy, and I was getting ready to file a story 
on the subject to the Washington Post when Hijran came rushing into 
my work room. She had been on the telephone with the information 
section of the Popular Front, and had some very distressing news: 
sources in Agdam were reporting a stream of Azeri refugees from 
Karabakh filling the streets of the city, fleeing a massive attack. 
There had been many exaggerated reports about the conflict 
germinated from both sides, and perhaps this was just another, but I 
thought  it  best  to  start  working  the  phone.  Strangely,  no  one  in 
government  answered.  Perhaps  they  were  all  at  the  Gulistan 
complex, having dinner with the Iranian delegation. So I waited for a 
while, and then started calling people at home. Around midnight, I 
got through to Vafa Guluzade. 
www.avciya.az- 27 -

"Sorry for calling so late," I apologized. "But what about this 
rumor--".  "I  can't  talk  about  it,"  said  Vafa,  cutting  me  off  and 
hanging up.
A sense of unease filled my gut. Vafa was usually polite to a 
fault. Perhaps he was sleeping? I decided to call again anyway, but 
the number stayed busy for the next half hour. Maybe he left it off 
the  hook,  I  thought,  and  made  one  last  effort  and  the  call  rang 
through. 
"Vafa," I said, apologizing again. "What is going on?"
"Something very terrible has happened," he groaned.
"What?" I demanded.
"There has been a massacre," he said.
"Where?"   
"In Karabakh, a town called Khojaly," he said, and then he 
hung up the phone again. 
Khojaly
I had been there before. Twice, in fact. The first time was in 
September,  when we had staked out  the airport  waiting  for Boris 
Yeltsin to come through. The last time had been a month before, in 
January,  1992.  By  then  the  only  way  to  get  to  Khojaly  was  by 
helicopter  because  the  Armenians  had  severed  the  road  link  to 
Agdam. I remembered that little adventure all too well. Doubting the 
many reports from the Armenian side that the Azeris were massively 
armed and that their helicopters were 'buzzing' Armenian villages in 
the territory for fun and terror,  I  had traveled out to Agdam with 
Hugh Pope of the (London) Independent to chat with refugees about 
their situation. 
www.avciya.az- 28 -
Khojaly genocide: million signatures – one demand
Refugees were easy to find at Agdam. They were all over the 
place.  The heaviest  concentration  was at  the local  airfield  for  the 
simple reason that many of the refugees didn't want to be refugees 
anymore:  they were  going  back  to  their  homes  in  Khojaly.  Their 
pride had silenced their better sense. One was a 35-year old mother 
of four by the name of Zumrut Ezova. When I asked why she was 
returning, she said it was better 'to die in Karabakh' than beg in the 
streets of Agdam. 
"Why can't the government open the road?" shouted Zumrut 
in my ear over the roar of the nearby chopper's engines, "Why are 
they making us fly in like ducks, ready to get shot?"
I didn't have an answer. 
Then  someone  was  lurching  toward  me  from  across  the 
airfield.  It  was  Alef Hajiev,  the commander  of airport  security at 
Khojaly  and  the  gentleman  who  had  saved  us  from  the  Agdam 
drunks during the Yeltsin visit  three months  before.  He had been 
pretty chipper then, but despite his broad smile for me, he was no 
longer  fun and games.  I  asked him what  the  situation  was in  his 
hometown. 
"Come on," said Hajiev. "Let's go to Khojaly - then you can 
see for yourself, and write the truth if you dare." 
Behind  him  stood  a  MI-8  helicopter,  its  blades  slowly 
turning.  A mass  of  refugees  were  clawing  their  way aboard.  The 
chopper  was  already  dangerously  overloaded  with  humanity  and 
food-stuff,  and  waiting  on  the  tarmac  was  even  more  luggage, 
including a rusted, 70mm cannon and diverse boxes of ammunition. 
"I'm not going," said Pope, "I've got a wife and kids." 
The rotor began to twirl faster, and I had to decide quickly. 
"See you later," I said, wondering if I ever would. 
I got aboard, one of more than 50 people on a craft designed 
for 24, in addition to the various munitions and provisions. I thought 
to myself: this is insane; there is still time to get off. Then it was too 
late. With a lurch, we lifted off the ground and my stomach smashed 
www.avciya.az- 29 -

through my ears. I could see Pope waving at me while walking away 
from the field, and wished I was with him on terra firma. The MI-8 
cork-screwed up to its flight altitude of 3500 feet-high enough to sail 
over the Askeran Gap to Khojaly and avoid Armenian ground fire. 
Two  dozen  helicopters  had  been  hit  over  the  past  two  months, 
including  the  crash/kill  not  only  the  one  filled  with  officials  in 
November, but another 'bird' a week before. The machine we were 
flying  in  had  picked  up  a  round  through  the  fuel  tank  the  week 
before, the flight engineer told me. It was lucky that fuel was low 
and the bullet came in high. This was all very reassuring to learn as 
we plugged on through the Askeran Gap, bucking into head-winds 
and sleet. 
Through breaks  in  the  cloud cover  I  could  see  trucks  and 
automobiles driving the roads below-Armenian machines, fueled by 
gas and diesel brought in via their own air-bridge from Armenia (or 
purchased from Azeri war profiteers). Finally and mercifully, after a 
trip  that  seemed  to  take  hours,  but  really  only  lasted  maybe  20 
minutes,  we began our  corkscrew descent  to  the  Khojaly airfield. 
No-one who has not been aboard such a flight can appreciate what I 
felt when the wheels touched ground. 
I am alive! I wanted to shout, but thought it most appropriate 
to stay cool and act like I did such things twice a day. 
"How do you feel?" Alef Hajiev asked me. 
"Normalno," I lied in Russian, cool as cake. 
Meanwhile,  the  chopper  was  mobbed  by  residents-some 
coming to greet loved ones who had returned; others trying to be the 
first aboard the helicopter when it went back up and out.  All were 
there  to  get  the  most  recent  news  from  the  rest  of  Azerbaijan: 
newspapers, gossip, rumors. 
The reason for the excitement was pretty obvious: there were 
no working phones in Khojaly, no working anything: no electricity, 
no heating oil and no running water.  The only link with the outside 
world was the helicopter-and those were under threat with each run.

The isolation of the place became all too apparent as night fell.  I 
joined Hajiev and some of his men in the make-shift mess hall of the 
tiny garrison, and while we dined on Soviet army SPAM with raw 
onions and stale bread to flickering candle light, he gave me what 
might be called a front-line briefing. 
The situation was bad and getting worse, a depressed Hajiev 
told me.  The Armenians had taken all the outlying villages, one by 
one, over the past three months. Only two towns remained in Azeri 
hands:  Khojaly and Shusha,  and the  road  between them was cut. 
While I knew the situation was deteriorating, I had no idea it was so 
bad. 
"It  is  because  you  believe  what  they  say  in  Baku,"  Alef 
chortled. "We are being sold-out, utterly."
Baku  could  open  the  road  to  Agdam  in  a  day  if  the 
government  wanted to,  he said.  He now believed the  government 
actually  wanted  the  Karabakh  business  to  simmer  on  to  distract 
public attention while the elite continued to plunder the country. 
"If you write that and attribute it to me, I'll deny it," he said. 
"But it's true." 
The 60 odd men under his command lacked both the weapons 
and  training  to  defend  the  straggling  perimeter.  The  only  Azeri 
soldiers worth their salt were four veterans from the Soviet war in 
Afghanistan who had volunteered to try and bring some discipline 
into  the  ranks  of  the  defenders.  The  rest  were  green-horns-if  the 
Armenians shot off one round, they would answer with a barrage of 
fire and waste half their precious ammunition. So it was that night: 
around two AM, I was awoken from my sleep by a distant burst of 
fire  coming  from  the  direction  of  a  neighboring  Armenian  town 
called Laraguk, about 500 yards away from a part of Khojaly called, 
ironically enough, 'Helsinki Houses.' The Armenian sniper fire was 
returned  with  at  least  100  rounds  from the  Azeri  side,  including 
bursts of cannon fire from an old BTR, newly acquired from some 
Russian deserter. It was the only mechanized weaponry I saw in the 
www.avciya.az- 31 -
Khojaly genocide: million signatures – one demand
hands of the Azeris. The fire-fight continued sporadically until dawn, 
making it  impossible  to  sleep.  No-one knew when the Armenians 
would make their final push to take the town; everyone knew that 
some night they would. Khojaly controlled the Stepanakert airport 
and was clearly a major objective for the Armenians. They had to 
take  it.  I  thought  to  myself:  I  would,  if  I  were  them.  With  that 
thought came another that  filled  me with unease:  what would the 
residents do when they did? 
In  the  morning,  people  were  just  standing  around-literally. 
There was not a single tea shop or restaurant to idle away the time, 
so people just  stood in small  knots in the mud and gravel streets, 
waiting. The only person I saw actually do something was a very fat 
girl who worked as a sales clerk in the fabric shop where there was 
nothing to sell. I first saw her rapidly waddling to work at nine in the 
morning; the intensity of purpose was unique, so I followed her into 
her shop. I next saw in a video, lying dead on the ground with a pile 
of others-but that was later. The rest just waited around, waiting for 
the ax to fall. I just prayed that it wouldn't be while I was there. 
We  wasted  the  morning  away  around  the  airport;  a 
photographer from an Azeri news agency happened to be around, so 
the military boys put on a good show, rolling out of their bunkers 
and running behind the old BTR, guns blazing. 
'Let's do it again, but this time, let me take pictures from the 
front," the cameraman asked. 
I  felt  sick  and  refused  to  have  anything  to  do  with  the 
theatrics. 
'These guys are going to die,' I said to myself.  'And I do not 
want to die with them just because they are so stupid to be shooting 
at shadows that shoot back.'
Alef  Hajiev  seemed  to  agree.  We  sat  together  in  silence, 
watching his men pose for the camera, running hither and yon with 
brave looks carved on their physiognomies. 
'Let's try that one again!' crowed the photographer. 
www.avciya.az- 32 -
Khojaly genocide: million signatures – one demand
There was not much else to say. 
Finally, around noon, I heard the tell-tale whine of a chopper 
moving high over the Gap.  Thank God! crowed, but tried to look 
indifferent. Then I made my way toward the airfield, and just in time 
to see the overloaded bird disgorge its cargo of food, weapons and 
returning refugees. One kid got off with a canary in a cage, or maybe 
he was getting on. I think it was the former, but honestly, I cannot 
say for sure. There were a lot of people at the airport, trying to get on 
and off that lone bird, and I was merely one of them. 
When those getting on seemed to be more than those getting 
off,  I  tried  to  get  on  myself.  I  didn't  care  that  the  chopper  was 
carrying twice or three times its weight limit, nor did I mind that part 
of that  weight was a corpse-one of Hajiev's boys  picked off  by a 
sniper the night before. I wondered if we had had Soviet-style SPAM 
dinner together, but thought it impolite to pull back the death-sheet 
and  stare.  The  engines  gunned and whined,  and  we lifted  with  a 
lurch-but this time I was not afraid of the flight. I just wanted out. 
We  climbed  and  climbed,  cork-screwing  high  into  the  sky  and 
blowing over the Askeran Gap at 3500 feet with tail-winds. Maybe 
we took ground fire; I do not know. But this I did: I would never go 
back to Khojaly again. 
There were no need for vows. 
The last  helicopter  flight  into the surrounded town was on 
February 13th. 
The last food, save for locally grown potatoes, ran out on the 
21st. 
The clock was ticking quickly toward doom. 
It struck on the night of February 26--the anniversary of the 
massacre  of  Armenians  at  Sumgait  in  1988.  Only  this  time, 
vengeance would demand not an eye for an eye, but whole human 
heads.

* * *
We were in the car at seven and drove as quickly as we could 
across  the  monotonous  flats  of  central  Azerbaijan.  Brown  cotton 
fields belonging to collective farms stretched to the horizon in all 
directions, and men stood along the roadside waving dead ducks at 
us as we roared by. We stopped for gas at a town named Terter and 
asked the local mayor  what was happening in Agdam. He said he 
didn't  know  anything.  We  stopped  again  in  another  town  called 
Barda, and again took a moment to inquire about events and rumors. 
Clueless looks greeted us. 
We  were  starting  to  think  that  the  whole  thing  was  an 
exaggerated bum-steer when we arrived in Agdam and drove into the 
middle of town, looking for a bite to eat. It was there that we ran into 
the  refugees.  There  were  ten,  then  twenty  then  hundreds  of 
screaming,  wailing  residents  of  Khojaly.  Many  recognized  me 
because  of  my  previous  visits  to  the  town.  They clutched  at  my 
clothes, babbling out the names of their dead relatives and friends 
and dragged me to the morgue attached to the main mosque in town 
to show me bodies of their relatives. 
At first we found it hard to believe what the survivors were 
saying:  the  Armenians  had  surrounded  Khojaly  and  delivered  an 
ultimatum: get out or die.  Then came a babble of details of the last 
days, many concerning Commander Alef Hajiev. 
Sensing doom, Alef had begged the government to bring in 
choppers to save at least some of the non-combatants, but Baku had 
done  nothing.  Then,  on  the  night  of  February  25th,  Armenian 
fedayeen  hit  the  town from three  sides.  The  fourth had  been  left 
open, creating a funnel through which refugees might flee. Alef gave 
the order to evacuate: the fighting men would run interference along 
the  hillside  of  the  Gorgor  River  valley,  while  the  women  and 
children and gray-beards escaped below. Groping their way through 
the night under fire, by the morning of February 26th, the refugees 
www.avciya.az- 34 -
Khojaly genocide: million signatures – one demand
made it  to the outskirts  of a village called Nakhichevanly,  on the 
cusp of Karabakh. They crossed a road and began working their way 
downhill toward the forward Azeri lines and the city Agdam, now 
only some six miles away via the Azeri outpost at Shelli. 
It was there, in the hillocks and within sight of safety,  that 
something horrible awaited them: a gauntlet of lead and fire.  "They 
just  shot  and  shot  and  shot,"  wailed  a  woman  named  Raisha 
Aslanova. She said her husband and a son-in-law were killed in front 
of her and that her daughter was missing. 
Scores, hundreds, possibly a thousand were slaughtered in a 
turkey-shoot of civilians and their handful of defenders. Aside from 
counting every body there was no way to tell-and most of the bodies 
remained out of reach, in the no-man's land between the lines that 
had become a killing zone and a picnic site for crows. 
One thousand dead in one night?  It seemed impossible. But 
when we began cross-referencing, the wild claims about the extent of 
the killing began to look all too true. The local religious leader in 
Agdam, Imam Sadik Sadikov, broke down in tears as he tallied the 
names of the registered dead on an abacus. There were 477 that day, 
a number that did not include those missing and presumed dead, nor 
those victims whose entire families had been wiped out and thus had 
no  one  to  register  them  as  dead  before  God.  The  number  477 
represented only the number of confirmed dead by survivors who 
had made it to Agdam and were physically able to fulfill, however 
imperfectly,  the  Muslim  practice  of  burying  the  dead  within  24 
hours. 
Elif  Kaban of  Reuters  was stunned into silliness.  My wife 
Hijran was paralyzed. Photographer Oleg Litvin fell into a catatonic 
state and would only shoot pictures when I threw him at the subject: 
corpses, graves, and wailing women who were gouging their cheeks 
with their nails. Yes, it required stomach-but it was time to work, to 
report:  a massacre  had occurred,  and the world had to know. We 
scoured the town, making repeated stops at the hospital, morgue and 
www.avciya.az- 35 -
Khojaly genocide: million signatures – one demand
growing graveyards,  out to the ends of the defensive perimeter  to 
make  horrible  spot-interviews  with  straggling  survivors  as  the 
stumbled in,  and then went back to the hospital  to check on new 
wounded and then back to the morgue to watch truck-loads of bodies 
be brought in for identification and ritual washing before burial.  I 
looked for familiar faces, and thought I saw some but could not be 
sure:  one  corpse  was  identified  as  that  belonging  to  a  young 
veterinarian, who had been shot through the eye at point-blank range; 
I tried to remember if I had known or been introduced to such a man 
in  Khojaly,  but  could  not  be  sure.  Other  bodies,  stiffened  by 
rigormortis, seemed to speak of execution: arms were thrown up as if 
in permanent  surrender.  A number  of heads lacked hair,  as  if  the 
corpses had been scalped. It was not a pretty day. 
Toward  late  afternoon,  someone  mentioned  that  a  military 
helicopter  on  loan  from the  Russian  garrison  at  Ganja  would  be 
making a flight over the killing fields, and so we traveled out to the 
airport. There was no flight, but there I found old friends. 
"Tomas," a man in military uniform gasped, and grabbed me 
in an embrace, and wept. "Nash Nachalnik..." 
I recognized him as one of Alef Hajiev's boys, a pimply-faced 
boy from Baku who had described himself as a banker before he had 
volunteered  for  duty  in  Karabakh.  He  was  speaking  in  Russian, 
babbling-but one word got through the tears: the commander... 
A few other  survivors  from the  Khojaly garrison stumbled 
over  and  seized  me.  Of  the  forty  odd  men  under  Alef  Hajiev's 
command,  only  ten  were  left  alive.  Dirty,  exhausted  and exuding 
what can only be described as survivor's guilt, they pieced together 
the awful night and next day-and the death of their commander, Alef 
Hajiev. He was killed by a bullet to the brain while defending the 
women and children; most of the women and children died anyway.

***
Toward evening, we returned to the government guest house 
in the middle of town to look for a telephone, and there we met a 
drained and exhausted Tamerlan Garayev.  A native of Agdam, the 
deputy  speaker  of  parliament  was  one  of  the  few  government 
officials of any sort I saw there. He was interrogating two Turkmen 
deserters  from  the  Stepanakert-based  366th  Motorized  Infantry 
Brigade  of  the  Russian  Interior  Ministry  forces.  They  had  taken 
refuge in Khojaly a week before.  The last  element  of the tragedy 
suddenly clicked into place: it was not only the Armenians who had 
assaulted the doomed town, but the Russians. 
"Talk, talk!" said Tamerlan, as the two men stared at us. 
"We ran away because the Armenian  and Russian  officers 
beat us because we were Muslims," one of the pair, a man named 
Agamuhammad  Mutif  related.  "We  just  wanted  to  go  home  to 
Turkmenistan." 
"Then what happened?" Tamerlan demanded. 
"Then  they  attacked  the  town,"  said  the  other.  "We 
recognized vehicles from our unit." 
I thought of Commander Sergei Shukrin, and wondered if he 
had been involved.  The two fled along with everyone  else  in the 
town,  and  were  helping  a  group  of  women  and  children  escape 
through the mountains when they were discovered by the Armenians 
and 366th. 
"They opened fire and at least twelve were killed in our group 
alone," Mutif related. "After that, we just ran and ran." 
A Russian-backed assault  by Armenians on an Azeri town, 
resulting in up to one thousand dead? 
This  was news. But  it  was at  this  point  that  things started 
becoming very strange. No-one seemed very interested in the story 
we had stumbled on. Apparently, the idea that the roles of the good-
guys  and bad  guys  had  been  reversed  was  too  much:  Armenians 
slaughtering Azeris? 
www.avciya.az- 37 -
Khojaly genocide: million signatures – one demand
"You are suggesting that more people have died in one attack 
in Karabakh than the total number we have reported killed over the 
past  four  years?"  said  the  BBC's  Moscow  correspondent  when  I 
tipped him on the slaughter. 
"That's impossible." 
"Take a look at Reuters!" 
"There's nothing on the wire." 
Indeed.  While  Elif  Kaban  was  churning  out  copy  on  her 
portable telex, nothing was appearing on the wires. Either someone 
was  spiking  copy,  or  was  rolling  it  into  larger,  anodyne  regional 
reports of 'conflicting allegations'.  To be fair,  the government  and 
press in Baku didn't exactly assist in supporting our reporting. While 
we were off in Agdam trying to get out the news, the presidential 
spokesman  was  claiming  that  Khojaly's  scrappy  defenders  had 
beaten back an Armenian attack and suffered only two dead. Just a 
regular night in Mountainous Karabakh. We knew differently, but it 
was the three of us against the Azerbaijani state lie machine. 
Finally,  I  got  a line through to  the  Moscow bureau of the 
Washington Post and said I wanted to file a story. The staffers there 
were to busy to take a dictation, but reluctantly patched me through 
to the foreign desk in Washington when I insisted. I used 477 as the 
number of dead, as religiously reported to Imam Sadikov, and was 
dragged over the coals by editors: where did I get this number from 
when Baku was still reporting that only two had died? Had I seen all 
the bodies? What about a little  balance? The Armenian press was 
reporting a 'massive Azeri offensive.' Why wasn't that in my report? 
I was about to answer that this bit of information was not in 
my report for the very good reason that it had not happened when the 
first Kristal missile crashed into Agdam, about a mile a away from 
the government guest house I was calling from.  Then came others 
and when one crashed into the building next door and blew out all 
the windows in our downtown dacha we thought it best to get off the 
phone and into the basement before we were blown to smithereens. 
www.avciya.az- 38 -
Khojaly genocide: million signatures – one demand
After about an hour of huddling under mattresses we came up 
for air and decided it was probably a good idea to leave Agdam. So 
did about 50,000 other people, and we discovered ourselves in the 
middle  of  a  mass  exodus  of  trucks,  cars,  horses  and  people  on 
bicycles, all trying to flee East.  
* * *
I broke the story about the Khojaly massacre with a February 
27, world exclusive on an inside page in the Washington Post.  This 
was followed with a 'European'  front page of the London Sunday 
Times. By then, the international hack-pack had started parachuting 
in to count the bodies and confirm that something very awful had 
happened.  The  first  western  reporter  to  actually  get  out  into  the 
killing fields and perform the grisly task of checking documents on 
the dead was Anatol Lieven of the London Times. His companion in 
the  task  was  the  late  Rory Peck of  Frontline  News,  another  cool 
professional and dear friend. 
Others performed less well. One best nameless reporter from 
Ajans France Press arrived in Agdam the night we left and found the 
city 'quiet,' apparently having confused the silence that followed the 
missile-induced  exodus  of  50,000  people  with  peacefulness.  Still 
another, while a guest at my house, abused the confidence of Vafa 
Guluzade  by grossly  misquoting  him.  At  the  height  of  the  crisis, 
Douglas  Kennedy,  son  of  Robert,  showed  up  with  a  KGB-
minder/translator  from St.  Petersburg,  and  thought  he  might  do  a 
little poking around the Front for amusement. After convincing him 
that his translator would probably get killed by a mob, Kennedy took 
my advice and hired two local lads, and then refused to pay them. 
The government of Azerbaijan, meanwhile, had performed a 
complete  about-face  on  the  issue.  The  same  people  who  had 
www.avciya.az- 39 -
Khojaly genocide: million signatures – one demand
remained  unavailable  during  the  early  days  of  the  crisis  were 
suddenly asking me to provide numbers of foreign correspondents in 
Moscow whom they could invite down, at government expense, to 
report on the massacre. 
I  did not react  very well.  I  almost  physically assaulted the 
presidential press secretary, Rasim Agaev, and publicly accused him 
of lying. The spokesman was not pleased and began a rumor that I 
was an Armenian spy sent to Khojaly to ferret out 'military secrets' 
during  my  January  visit  to  the  doomed  town.  I  was  temporally 
detained thanks to that charge, and started to slide into a very bad 
mood.  When I  was  released  I  went  downtown and found myself 
sitting around a commercial shop with a bunch of black marketeers, 
vaguely waiting for rubles to arrive in exchange for my dollars, when 
the whole thing hit me and hit me hard. 
The evening streets  were still  filled with smiling shoppers, 
apparently oblivious or even indifferent to the fate of the citizens of 
Khojaly. It was the same men in leather jackets and the same women 
with far too much rouge on their cheeks and they were all smiling 
and laughing and parading and I have to say I hated them all. Maybe 
they didn't know what I did. Maybe they knew, but didn't care lest it 
drive them insane. It was not clear and neither was my brain. 
I  canceled  the  dollar  deal,  walked  out  of  the  shop  and 
wandered  the  streets.  I  think  it  rained,  but  I  cannot  be  sure.  I 
wandered and wandered, unable to stop anywhere or see or talk to 
anyone  for  hours  and  hours.  "Ha  ha,"  someone  cackled,  as  they 
leaned toward their gal, or turned on the key to their car. 
"Ho  ho,"  someone  else  chortled  as  they  lurched  out  of  a 
Komisyon shop, bottle of Finnish vodka under the arm. 
I  wanted  to  slash  their  tires,  smash their  noses,  burn their 
houses-do something, and violently. 
I did nothing but wander the streets and avoid humanity.  It 
was better like that. Then I got home I sat down and poured myself a 
long drink and drank it and Hijran asked me where I'd been. 
www.avciya.az- 40 -
Khojaly genocide: million signatures – one demand
"Khojaly," someone said in a voice I didn't know. I was there 
with the ghosts in a dumpy town with no food to speak of or water to 
wash and all the people I knew or had known there were dead dead 
dead and I just started to cry and cry and cry. 
* * *
There weren't too many bodies.  Most were still in the hills, 
waiting for the higher temperatures of spring for rot to set. Some, the 
few,  were  being  spaded  into  the  shallow  ground  of  the  growing 
Martyrs' Cemetery across from the parliament building in Baku. One 
of those was Alef Hajiev. I liked to think of him as a friend because 
we had consumed a few drinks together. A jocular cop with a big 
swagger  and  smile,  Alef  had  managed  to  galvanize  the  Khojaly 
community around him in the belief  that  despite  the odds and an 
almost  total  lack  of  support  from Baku  they  could  hang  on  and 
survive.  But  now Alef  Hajiev  was  dead.  He had  bought  a  bullet 
through the brain and after rotting for a week in the mountains of the 
Black Garden his body was bought for 100 liters of gasoline and then 
brought back to Baku to be buried with military honors. 
Despite the proximity of the parliament across the street no-
one from the government came to the funeral and maybe that was out 
of good taste because had they been there, whispering eulogies about 
courage and fortitude,  Alef,  the hero and then martyr  of Khojaly, 
might have broken free of the bonds of death and climbed out of his 
grave and strangled the hypocrites with his own cold hands. He was 
that sort of guy. 
But they weren't there and the funeral procession was small 
because Alef was a native of Khojaly and all or at least most of the 
would-be mourners were either dead or had become refugees, and 
had to be brought to Baku by truck or bus or train for the last rites. 
www.avciya.az- 41 -
Khojaly genocide: million signatures – one demand
The exception was Alef's widow, Gala, a chubby Russian girl 
with a hint of a mustache who lived in Baku. We had met in Agdam 
in the aftermath of the massacre and she refused to believe that her 
husband was dead. Aside from an overwhelming sense of grief she 
was  frightened  out  of  her  wits,  wondering  how  she  could  live 
without him. 
"I'm  just  a  Russian,  a  Russian!"  she  cried.  "And  now 
everyone looks at me with hatred in their eyes!" That was in Agdam 
when anyone who wasn't speaking Azeri was indeed being looked at 
through the evil eye. I gave her my telephone number in Baku and 
told her to call if there was anything I could do. She called a few 
days later, babbling into the phone. 
"Tomas," she wailed. "Alef is here." 
At first I thought a miracle of mistaken identity had occurred 
and that Alef was still alive. But Gala was only calling to tell me that 
Alef's  remains  had  been  recovered  in  an  exchange  with  the 
Armenians  for  several  dozen  gallons  of  gasoline,  and  then  been 
shipped to Baku for burial.  It was tough for me to understand her 
Russian on the telephone and probably a lot tougher for her to have 
to pick up the phone at all. But she stayed coherent long enough to 
give me her address and the time of the funeral procession. I went, 
not knowing what to expect: A week old cadaver in the living room? 
Mutilated like others? Scalped like some? I got in a taxi and traveled 
through a wasteland of hissing, blue and pink stuff-belching pipes of 
the oil refining area of Baku, driving over streets that had seemingly 
never seen repair. We drove and drove and it was a drive though an 
utterly depressing landscape, the sort that no-one ever sees, or admits 
to having seen: broken, diseased and bad. It was as much a symbol of 
the rapacity and ugliness of the regime in Baku as the corpses in 
Agdam had been.  How can you allow people to live and die like 
this? 
Complicating my dark mood was the fact that the Azeri taxi 
driver only wanted to make jokes, and in Russian. I told him what I 
www.avciya.az- 42 -
Khojaly genocide: million signatures – one demand
thought. I told him I was going to find the funeral of my friend, Alef 
Hajiev, Martyr of Karabakh, and that all the people of Baku were 
greedy  cowards  and  that  only  the  good  men  died  and  the  filth 
remained behind. He agreed, refusing to take any money for the ride. 
It was his contribution to national defense, or something. 
I got out of the taxi in front of a series of high-rise Soviet-
style buildings-the ones designed so that the toilet  is in a separate 
room from the sink. Degrading, like everything else around what was 
the USSR. Walking through the mourners I saw people I knew or at 
least  recognized  and  embraced  them.  Then  I  saw Gala.  She  was 
standing  in  back  of  a  truck  carrying  the  flag-draped  coffin  and 
holding the hand of her smiling child who was still oblivious to what 
had happened to her father. I said something stupid like 'be strong.' I 
tried to plant a hand-extended kiss on the coffin perched on the back 
of the truck but I couldn't reach it and decided against climbing up on 
the truck and just waited for the procession to proceed. There were 
plenty of people crying. Everyone but me. My eyes were dry; I don't 
know why.  Then  someone  somewhere  responsible  for  formalities 
gave  the  word  and  the  column  started  out  toward  the  Martyrs' 
Cemetery in the heights above Baku. The funeral train in was the 
same as my journey out, although the route was different:  another 
broken  road  leading  through  another  industrial  wasteland.  It  was 
Alef's  route  to  anywhere,  nowhere,  death.  We  arrived  at  the 
Shehidler  Khiyabani,  or  Martyrs'  Lane  cemetery,  the  place  where 
victims of the Soviet army crack-down on January 20th, 1990 were 
buried in a long line along a granite wall shaded by dwarf Cyprus 
trees and pine. 
I had visited the cemetery before and I have visited it since 
but it was different this time.  I wasn't there as a journalist covering 
the event or even a political/cultural tourist. I was there as a mourner, 
mourning Alef Hajiev, the most recent addition to the second tier of 
graves, where the dates of death are different than in the first row. 
There was no third road, then. a place that would and will continue to 
www.avciya.az- 43 -

grow.  Alef's  was  the  127th  grave  then,  a  hole  in  the  ground 
surrounded by freshly dug earth. His casket was lifted down from the 
truck  and  I  joined  the  pall-bearers  as  they  hoisted  it  on  their 
shoulders and brought Alef's remains down the line as a local man of 
religion recited the 'Fatiha', or Muslim creed of faith. This was odd 
because I  was not sure whether Alef was a Muslim except  in the 
formal sense of the word. He never expressed anything approaching 
piety to me. When he was alive he was a drinking man, although he 
didn't smoke. This was really odd, because Azeris usually smoke all 
the time, even at funerals. And the strangest thing about Alef was 
that he certainly didn't like Turks. He once told me that he had found 
too many 'Made In Turkey' labels in the trash cans of Stepanakert to 
believe in any pan-Turkic ideal. 
I was thinking thought like this because I was remembering, 
which is what you are supposed to do when you punch bodies in the 
ground. Alef Hajiev was about to become the first of a whole string 
of people I knew who died violently over the next few years, so he 
got  more  thought  than  most.  Alef's  wife  Gala  and  her  Russian 
relatives  were  confused  by  the  ritual  placement  of  the  body,  the 
pious incantations and the fact that the week-old corpse had to be 
lifted out of the casket to be put in the hole dug in the muddy ground. 
They put the body in. An honor guard clicked their heels, slapped 
dummy slugs in their  Kalashnikovs, and let off three volleys.  The 
empty shells fell clattering on the granite walkway. I picked up one 
and put it in my pocket. Then the family and intimate friends began 
covering the body with dirt and the wailing really began. Women 
ripped their cheeks with their nails and men sobbed last regards. I 
was invited to say something into the grave but declined. I had quite 
a bit to say but I didn't want to say it, even in a language no one 
would  understand.  Cultural  differences  and  all.  I  would  do  it 
differently today. 
Then another, larger funeral procession started moving down 
Martyrs'  Row.  They  were  heading  for  the  shallow  grave  next  to 
www.avciya.az- 44 -

Alef's. It was the corner spot and the next corpse would start a new 
row,  even  then  being  dug  among  the  dwarf  Cyprus  trees  in 
anticipation for the next to  die in  the Black Garden,  that  horrible 
place called Karabakh. More young men would soon lie here and 
their numbers would soon exceed all those killed at Khojaly and the 
events of February 25th and 26th, 1992 would soon become just a 
detail, just another grim statistic in the on-going litany of death and 
destruction in Karabakh, the Black Garden. 
I  swore I  would remember  Alef  and all  the others,  whose 
names I never knew but whose faces were etched on my memory 
forever. Yes, I would remember Khojaly. 
It was a dump. But now it was dead.

BLOOD SPOTS ON THE SNOW…
Once upon a time,  there was an ancient  town in Nagorno-
Karabakh  region  of  Azerbaijan.  The  town  was  located  in  a 
fascinating  corner  of  the  country,  expanding and growing prettier 
day by day. This hearth harbored indigenous population, as well as 
newcomers, Akhiska (Meskhetian) Turks expelled from far Fergana 
and  representatives  of  other  nationalities  who  sheltered  there 
regarding this district  as a warm refuge for themselves.  The town 
with seven and more thousands of population was called … Khojaly. 
Today, this town, the name of which still remains on the map 
of Azerbaijan, does not exist any more… Khojaly, together with its 
children  -  local  residents  turned  into  a  victim  of  the  Armenians, 
settled down in the territory of Azerbaijan with the help of tsarist 
Russia in XIX century. They even established their own state called 
now Armenia by gradual appropriation of these lands and using their 
inherent  slyness,  cunning and falseness and not resting even after 
that, they still try to appropriate the lands of neighboring countries 
with inexhaustible territorial greed … 
Within a night, Khojaly was razed to the ground at the end of 
XX century while the mankind strived for the civil, democratic, safe 
and stable  world.  At  this  terrible  winter  night,  the  white  coverlet 
stretched by the old nature over mountains, valleys and plains was 
stained with the scarlet blood of Khojaly citizens - women and men, 
the young and the old, children and adults…
Due to the incomplete bloody statistics declared hot on the 
heels,  613  Khojaly  inhabitants  became  martyrs  on  26  February, 
1992, night. Since the site of the crime against unarmed and peaceful 
population was under constant fire and the enemy’s control, it was 
impossible to take out corpses and only 335 of them were buried. 
According  to  the  same  incomplete  statistics,  63  children  and 
teenagers,  106  women  and  girls  and  70  aged  were  among  those 
www.avciya.az- 46 -
Khojaly genocide: million signatures – one demand
killed  with special  cruelty.  As a  result  of  the  tragedy,  over  1000 
citizens, including 76 infants, underage boys and girls got gunshot 
and missile wounds and became disabled. As a result of this criminal 
act,  8  families  were  completely  wiped  out,  25  children  lost  both 
parents and 130 - one parent. 56 people from amongst martyrs were 
killed with extreme brutality. 1275 of the town-dwellers were taken 
prisoner and hostage and the destiny of 150 is still unknown. 
In  fact,  the  number  of  victims  is  far  above.  American 
journalist Thomas Goltz wrote in his book “Azerbaijan Diary” that 
the number of the killed was 688 and the number of the buried based 
on  Moslem rules  was  477.  Investigations  of  independent  experts, 
researchers and agencies, testimonies of witnesses and victims reveal 
that  the  number  of  the  killed  and  frozen  to  death  or  committed 
suicide at 25-26 February night, as well as within the next several 
days exceeded 1000 people and the number of missing people, taken 
captive  and  hostage  is  much  above  the  mentioned  figure.  From 
amongst the brutally killed, there were 200 women some of whom 
were pregnant. 43 out of tens of killed children were juveniles and 
the youngest  was a two-day-old baby.  Some victims of Armenian 
gangsters  were  burned,  ran  over  by  military  vehicles  or 
dismembered. 
How could such vandalism be committed on the eve of XXI 
century?  Who committed  such a  brutal  crime,  unbecoming  to  the 
humanity? And who could do it except Armenian barbarians?! 
The slaughter,  going beyond analogues  for its  cruelty,  was 
committed by Armenians together with the Khankandy-based 366th 
Motorized Infantry Regiment of the former USSR. Its staff included 
49  Armenian  officers  and  praporshiks.  A  special  role  in 
implementing the planned operation on that fatal Khojaly assault and 
extirpation of its inhabitants - in majority children, women and old 
people - belonged to the commander of 2nd battalion Major Seyran 
Ohanyan, the today's  “Minister of Defense" of the self-proclaimed 
"Nagorno-Karabakh Republic" and Evgeni Nabokov heading the 3rd 
www.avciya.az- 47 -

battalion of 23rd division of 4th Russian Army under command of 
Lieu.  Col.  Jury Zarvigarov.  The battalions were equipped with 92 
units  of modern heavy materiel,  including tanks, armored infantry 
vehicles, D-30 howitzers and other arsenal. By the way, it should be 
noted  that  attempts  to  deny the  fact  of  participation  of  the  366th 
Motorized Regiment in the bloody Khojaly genocide are not based 
on real grounds and it is proved both by investigative actions and 
testimonies of live witnesses. 
V.Savelyev,  the  counter-intelligence  chief  of  one  of  the 
military  units,  participating  in  the  Khojaly  storm  expounded  this 
event  in  his  work  "Confidential  reference"  based  on  facts  and 
documents and having observed the military operations led by the 
Russian  military  divisions  together  with  the  Armenian  terrorist 
organizations in Nagorno-Karabakh.  The author, apologizing in his 
work to  Azerbaijanis,  admitted  the  under-mentioned:  "I  could not 
help writing about all this. I can not forget the shot bodies of people, 
children and women and pregnant brides. Let Azerbaijanis forgive 
me that I could not do anything during these events with a bloody 
and  atrocious  consequences.  I  could  only  send  the  confidential 
information  to  the Kremlin  and generals  of  the Head Intelligence 
Department of the USSR Ministry of Defense. Read, he said. Look, 
how the honor of Russian officers is discredited."
 
The Khojaly massacre stands in one row with Khatin, Liditsa 
and Songmi tragedies,  but they cannot objectively come up to the 
Khojaly  by  a  mercilessness  and  cruelty  degree.  149  people  were 
murdered by fascist troops in Khatin, Belarus, for alleged assisting 
partisans during World War II. Besides, during the same period, 172 
inhabitants of Czechoslovak Liditsa town were killed and about 200 
women  and  children  were  sent  to  a  concentration  camp  for  the 
attempt  on  Rainkhaid  Geydrikh.  American  troops  wiped  out  500 
members of partisan families in Songmi village of Vietnam in the 
60s  of  the  past  century  while  struggling  against  the  world 
www.avciya.az- 48 -

communism. They scalped people and collected their  ears just for 
fun.  But  in  Khojaly,  hundreds  of  peaceful  people  were  violently 
murdered only because they were Moslems, Turks and Azerbaijanis. 
In other words, the genocide was committed. 
Yes, this fact should be evaluated not only as the genocide of 
innocent population of an Azerbaijani town, scripted by Armenian 
official circles and implemented by armed bandit troops, but also as 
the crime against the whole mankind. It was the genocide act against 
the  peaceful  citizens  and  representatives  of  Moslem  religion, 
including  women  and  children!  Armed  gangsters  murdered  and 
raped parents before the very eyes of their children just for fun. 
The town itself was razed at that bloody night to the ground.  
The families of Vagif Mammadov (including his spouse and 
three sons), Samran Karimov (including the spouse and two sons), 
Firdowsi  Aliyev  (including  the  spouse  and  two  sons),  Garsalan 
Ganbarov (including  the  spouse  and a  son),  70-year-old  Mirsiyab 
Husseinov (including his  58-year-old spouse),  72-year-old Gunesh 
Hassanov  (including  his  41-year-old  daughter)  and  Hussein 
Husseinov (including the spouse, two sons and two daughters) were 
annihilated.  We would like  to  bring to  a  reader’s  notice  just  few 
episodes of infinite events that are impossible to describe. It should 
be also mentioned that the confusion taken place upon the enemy’s 
assault  prevented  testimonies  of  tens  of  terrible  facts.  Just  pay 
attention to the disasters of survived people. 
The sobbing grandmother of 4-year-old murdered Lale told 
the following: “We were moving all together, but we lost each other 
when a skirmish started. We followed the way up to the city. Firuza, 
the sister of our daughter-in-law and her brother Akbar helped me to 
carry  the  grandchildren.  The  city  was  close.  My daughter-in-law 
Zarifa suckled the baby for the last time and gave her to me. The 
skirmish started when I gave Lale to her mother and tied 23-day-old 
Khayala  to  my  back...An  armenian  bullet  tore  Zarifa’s  chest  to 
pieces. Lale was trying to help her mother get up. We called her, but 
www.avciya.az- 49 -
Khojaly genocide: million signatures – one demand
she  did  not  want  to  come  up  to  us.  She  could  hardly  cover  her 
mother’s body with the clothes got stuck in shrubs. The people could 
not take her away from bullets. The little girl was hit as she put the 
last cloth on her mother. She could just say “oh” and dropped her 
head on her mother’s body, covered with blood…”. Lale, her mother 
Zarifa and her father Tahir were buried together in the cemetery of 
Aghdam. 
7-year-old Yavar Aliyev recollects: “The light went out in our 
house.  I  could  not  sleep.  When  the  firing  started,  we  ran  to  our 
neighbor’s cellar and then towards the forest. Armenians caught us 
on the way,  near Finnish houses…and started mowing down with 
submachine guns. Everybody lied down, but militants ordered us to 
rise and made us line up. The wounded and safe were separated…I 
was shot later. We were taken to Khankandy…My cousin Natavan 
was shot with a submachine gun. She was two. Malakhat and Melek 
were also shot…”.  Aliyeva Nasiba Rahim qizi, Yavar’s mother who 
lost her husband and relatives adds in tears: “We were banished from 
Armenia  and  came  to  Azerbaijan,  but  Armenians  got  us  here  … 
Everywhere was enveloped in flames on February 25. We gathered 
in cellars…and could come out only by morning. About forty people 
crowded into a factory’s cellar, but after armenian tanks shelled and 
destroyed the place, we ran towards the forest…A boy without legs 
was floundering on the roadside. It was Vugar Najafov. We placed 
him in one of the houses and then ran further…Near a building next 
to a bridge we saw about 50 soldiers. They called us in Azerbaijani 
language.  But  when  we  ran  towards  them,  we  saw  they  were 
Armenians and Russians. We returned, but they started shooting us 
in the back. We spread on the ground, but Armenians lifted us up. By 
that time, only fourteen of us had survived. As we got up, Armenians 
ordered us to give them up gold teeth, rings and earrings…They had 
taken themselves the things of the killed. One old man begged them 
falling to his knees not to kill his only son who had got married 8 
months  ago  and  kill  him  instead.  But  Mugan,  his  son  was 
www.avciya.az- 50 -
Khojaly genocide: million signatures – one demand
immediately  murdered  before  his  father’s  eyes.  He  was  a  son  of 
Jamil  Humbatov…His  daughter  Simuzari,  his  wife  Furuza  and 
daughter-in-law Sudaba  were  also  tortured  and  then  killed.  Jamil 
Humbatov himself was taken hostage, but he said he would not live 
anyway…In the morning, we were brought to Khankandy. My father 
Talibov Rahim Khudaverdi oglu disappeared there. They cut off the 
head of Meskhetian Turk Ahmad before our eyes and took his ears 
with themselves. Each of them kicked the cut off head…My 7-year-
old  son  Yavar  Aliyev  got  two  submachine  gun  wounds.  Two 
grandchildren of my elder sister and her daughter-in-law were also 
killed before my eyes…”.    
Khatira Orujova, who was 8 in 1992, recollects:  “We were 
asleep. Suddenly, we heard terrible crash. When got up and looked 
through  a  window,  we  saw  many  burning  houses.  I,  my  father, 
mother, brother and sisters ran towards a tunnel. My aunt Sevil with 
two  children  and  a  neighbor  with  two  children  were  also  with 
us...Then a man named Shaiq came and said that we had to run to a 
forest. At first, I was together with my father and mother. My little 
sister Khayala was with my mother and another sister was with my 
father. In Nakhichevanik, Armenians blocked our way...We stayed in 
the forest. My mother was shot first in the morning. My aunt Sevil 
was shot second. She was 17 and my mother Irada was 26…When 
Armenians  shot  me,  my  mother  was  still  beside  me.  She  was 
wounded and covered with blood, therefore, we could not run...In the 
forest, we lost our father. I do not remember anything else because I 
was  also  “killed”  a  little…Then  I  remember  that  someone  was 
carrying me. Who was it? I do not know…”. Khayala was wounded 
in the shoulder and chest. A bullet touched lungs and broke a rib, 
which caused strong bleeding. 
Sanam, the mother of Khayala Abdullayeva told: “A skirmish 
started when everyone was asleep. When I looked through a window, 
I saw the town was burning. We ran to our neighbors. We always hid 
in their well when there was a skirmish…A neighbor’s son Vugar

Ibrahimov came and said that Armenians had approached the village 
and we had to run away quickly. About 500 people ran to a forest. 
We also ran – my father, mother, grandmother, sisters, two daughters 
and nephew…We stayed in the forest  two days.  On the third day 
morning  Armenians  encircled  us.  The  heart  of  my  grandmother 
Hassanova Goychay broke just at that moment. My father took off 
his jacket and covered the grandmother’s body. We started running 
back, but we were fired in the back. The dead and wounded stayed, 
but  we continued  running.  At  the  mountain  foot,  my 17-year-old 
sister Latafat Abdullayeva said she could not run any more. She sat 
on the ground…I was very angry with her. I told my father to throttle 
and kill her as she could “give” us to Armenians. But my poor sister 
was really dying. My father sat on the ground and embraced her. Her 
eyes went out.  As she died,  my father took off  his  waistcoat  and 
covered her body…We started running down the hill. When we came 
down, we heard the voices of Armenians. My father said: - “Allah, 
have  mercy  on  these  babies!”…  When  I  came  back,  I  saw  my 
father’s  eyes  were  closed.  He had  died.  The  corpse  of  my father 
Hassan Hassanov stayed there…We could not even cover him with 
anything…Six of us left.  My sisters Tazagul,  23 and Khadija, 20, 
nephew  and  I  with  two  daughters…At  that  moment,  Armenians 
started  shooting  at  us  and  a  bullet  hit  4-year-old  Vusalya…
Armenians  took  us  captive  appropriating  our  rings  and  earrings. 
First, we were taken to Pirjamal and then to Khankandy. We were 
beaten  there...There  were  many  girls  and  bearded  men  outraged 
them…In the morning we were taken to Askeran and placed in a 
cellar.  There were many babies.  Vusala’s legs were wounded and 
bleeding.  She  often  got  unconscious…”.  Later  on,  Vusala’s  legs 
were amputated. Poor little girl, she had better run across a wild wolf 
instead of an Armenian.  Maybe then she would have a chance to 
survive… 
Sadagat Hussein qizi Agayeva, who lost three children during 
the Khojaly massacre, can hardly speak because of tears: “We stayed 
www.avciya.az- 52 -
Khojaly genocide: million signatures – one demand
in a forest at night. My two children, 6-year-old Roman and 7-year-
old Sevinj were shot…Roman died frozen in the forest”. How can 
this woman stand such a hard burden?
Khumar Salimova, who was 19 in 1992, recollects the terrors 
of that bloody night: “In 1992, on 26 February, night, Khojaly town 
was subjected to strong fire.  Armored cars invaded the town from 
every quarter. The fire started unexpectedly and it was so strong that 
we were dismayed and did not know what to do or where to run. My 
brothers  told  me  that  Armenians  had  intruded  the  town  and  we 
should have run away. We started running towards Katik Mount…
As we were running, maybe hundreds of people, hit with bullets, fell 
down to  earth.  But  when we reached  the  mountain,  an  “Alazan” 
missile killed my brother’s wife, but I was wounded in the shoulder 
and face. Many of my fellow-villagers got lost…The missiles, falling 
from the sky like hail, did not let us run. Having crossed an irrigation 
channel,  we crept  into  a  trench.  Morning  was  coming.  Suddenly, 
Armenians surrounded the trench and started shooting us down one 
by one. Taleh Guliyev was shot in the month.  Then his head was 
crushed before his wife’s eyes. As she started crying, she was also 
shot. 1-year-old Samir could not understand that his father had died 
and did not leave him alone…Then he was struck in the head with a 
rifle butt. He was struck so strongly that his brain came out…I lied 
among the dead pretending  to be dead for some time…When the 
skirmish sound calmed down, I started crawling slowly…But when I 
heard somebody speak in Azerbaijani, I gathered myself up and cried 
“mother”…I came to consciousness only in an Aghdam hospital…”.
Nazilya  Hamatova,  wounded  during  the  Khojaly  storm 
witnesses: “On February 26, morning, we ran to a forest along the 
Askeran road…In the forest a bullet hit me to the leg. I stayed there 
among corpses. There were a lot of wounded and dead people around 
me…Parvana  Azimova  was  shot  in  the  mouth  and  her  husband 
www.avciya.az- 53 -
Khojaly genocide: million signatures – one demand
Hasanbala Azimov was shot in the head. Aunt Gullu, uncle Ibish, 
their  son  Shohlat,  Telman’s  wife  Irada,  sister-in-law Sevil,  Aslan 
Allahverdiyev and his daughters Irada and Valida, uncle Avaz, his 
wife Teyba, aunt Satly and her son Arif were shot before my eyes. 
There  were  hundreds  of  corpses  around me.  I  was  just  lying  and 
waiting for the death to come.  7-year-old Khatira  was crying and 
trying to help her groaning mother right next to me…”
 
Samad Talibov, who lost both legs frozen during the Khojaly 
massacre, tells: “On February 26, night, Armenians started burning 
out the town. The scared people did not know where to run. Many 
were  running  barefoot  and  bareheaded…Our  group  of  120-130 
people  stayed  in  cold  Katik  forest.  After  some  time,  we  moved 
towards Kharay village. But another group of people we ran across 
told us that Armenians had shot down everybody there and suggested 
us not to go there. We returned to the forest again. The adults could 
somehow bear cold and hunger, but for children it was very hard. 
They were weeping and asking for bread.  What  could those poor 
children do? How could they stand this cold and hunger? We stayed 
in  the  forest  three  days  hungry  and  thirsty.  Then  we  made  for 
Nakhichevanik…But suddenly we saw that Armenians had encircled 
us from every side…They brought us kicking to a stable. There were 
other 50-60 people besides us. Later on, Armenians, crowding into 
the stable, started beating and mutilating us. They took away all our 
gold gauds…Men were made to carry firewood in the yard. There 
were many corpses in the yard…During the next beating, one young 
Meskhetian Turk could stand it no longer and shouted out: “Why are 
you  beating  me,  the  son  of  a  dog?”,  but  one  of  the  Armenians 
released  all  the  sub-machine  charger  into  his  body…It  is  hard to 
imagine how many young people were shot and honor of how many 
women and girls was overrode?!..”.

57-year-old witness of the Khojaly events Gulali Mehraliyev 
speaks  gasping:  “We spent  six  days  in  a  forest  together  with my 
daughter hungry and thirsty.  The frost, fears of the night forest and 
Armenians who could appear anytime frightened my poor daughter 
to death. My ill-fated girl could not endure it and died. I sat frozen 
beside my daughter’s body. I was looking at my miserable daughter 
and  crying.  She  was  20.  Six  months  ago,  I  had  married  her  off 
having paid 12 thousand manats for dowry. But now, my poor baby 
was lying  motionless on the ground…When I heard the voices of 
Armenians, I hid behind a fallen tree…I could reach Aghdam after 
passing through thousands of difficulties. But I am still very anxious 
about the corpse of my daughter…”. 
Do  you  know  a  mother  who  raised  her  hand  to  her  own 
daughter? Who is that miserable mother, compelled to commit such a 
crime?  What  could  make  a  mother  hurt  her  own  baby?  Being 
ashamed and confused of the terrible situation and at the same time 
happy  to  find  her  “killed”  and  miraculously  rose  from  the  dead 
daughter  again,  Mushkunaz  Akhmadova  shares  her  bitter  story: 
“Yes, I strangled my daughter sleeping in this cradle with my own 
hands.  I  had  no  other  chance.  Although  it  was  terribly  hard  and 
painful,  I  strangled  my  2-year-old  babe...I  did  not  want  dirty 
Armenians to get her…Because she did not stop crying, shouting and 
could in no way calm down. I thought if it went like this, Armenians 
could  easily  find  the  place  we  hid.  What  was  a  sin  of  our  poor 
babies? How could a thirsty and hungry baby stand such a frost? We 
left our houses not being able to take anything...About 200 people 
were around me. Most of them were barefoot and half-naked. There 
was no food and we ate snow of hunger. Most of the children could 
not stand frost  and died…The rest  were crying.  We stayed in the 
forest three days…My daughter did not stop screaming…I noticed 
that people were dissatisfied. They bewared of her loud weeping. I 
could not stand it any more. Sobbing bitterly and with heavy stone 
www.avciya.az- 55 -
Khojaly genocide: million signatures – one demand
on my heart I strangled the child with my own hands. She throbbed a 
little  and stayed still.  She was dead.  She did not cry any more.  I 
embraced my poor child and cried. How could I forgive myself such 
a crime? No, I would never forgive myself this unexampled crime. I 
should  punish myself  for  this  horrible  crime…We started  moving 
towards Dahraz village. I took the corpse of my daughter with me to 
bury her somewhere. Armenians stopped us near Dahraz village and 
locked in a cattle-shed. I was sitting on the cold ground with my 
daughter’s dead body in my arms. Sometimes, I looked at her with 
strange fear. I was almost dead of repentance. I thought there was no 
use to  kill  the child;  Armenians  would have caught  us anyway.  I 
should not have strangled my poor baby. While I was getting mad of 
such exhausting thoughts, little Salatin moved and started to bustle 
about. I was so astonished that I could not move. I could not believe 
that she rose from the dead and revived. I opened the clothes she was 
muffled up and started to shower kisses on my sweet baby…”. The 
girl was named Salatin following the advice of National Hero Salatin 
Asgarova  murdered  later  by  Armenian  bandits…Her  mother 
Mushkunaz  became  an  invalid  after  her  frostbitten  toes  were 
amputated… 
Jamal Husseinov can hardly speak of the bloody events he 
witnessed at that terrible night: “I was 57 in 1992. My brother Latif 
lived in  Khojaly.  His three out of eight  children  were in Khojaly 
during the assault…On February 28,  I  together  with some friends 
was taking corpses to Shelli village. But Armenians did not let us do 
it. Finally,  on February 29, we could bring corpses from the place 
named “Garagaya”. There were many corpses in the two-kilometer 
territory  of  a  farm.  Some  women  were  killed  together  with  their 
children…Some children’s chests were lanced and hearts were cut 
up. Most of the corpses were dismembered. I found the dead body of 
my close relative Zohra there. She was dressed in the uniform of the

National Army. One of her legs was cut off…A bullet hit her to the 
forehead…My brother Latif was killed by Armenians in Khojaly.  
Malakhat  Husseinova,  the  mother  of  four  children  speaks 
with an aching heart: “…We stayed the whole day in a cellar thirsty 
and hungry…But Armenians found us and killed my husband before 
my  eyes…There  were  Syrians  and  the  Lebanese  among  them. 
Armenians  raped  and  then  killed  my  7-year-old  daughter…They 
were not afraid of God…”. 
The mother of three children Nana Mehdiyeva: “Few of us 
survived from a group of 150 people…An armored car blocked our 
way. My husband Murad shouted me to lie down. I clasped 5-year-
old Arzu to my bosom and lied down to save her if I was killed. 
Then I crawled to my husband to die together with him. Murad was 
killed.  At the last  moment,  he stretched his  hands to  me as if  he 
wanted to say something, but he could not…Uncle Safa and my 5-
year-old daughter were also killed. Elman was killed trying to save 
my 3-year-old daughter…”. 
Kubra Rzayeva: “We almost reached the Katik forest when 
Armenians encircled us. I hid in shrubs and saw how my husband 
Shura and son Elshad were shot”. 
Khazangul  Amirova:  “My  mother  Raya,  7-year-old  sister 
Yegana and my aunt Goycha were killed by Armenians. They burnt 
my father Tavakkul having poured gasoline over him”.  
Zoya Aliyeva: “150 of us stayed in a forest for three days. 
Dunya Ahmadova and her sister Gulkhar got frozen to death”.  
Saida Karimova:  “12 of us were taken hostage.  Armenians 
tortured to death my daughter Nazakat, as well as Taptiq, Saadat and 
Irada”. 
Can the people killing fragile infants, women and the elderly 
be  named  humans?  Who  could  cover  hands  with  the  blood  of 
innocent infants shot at the deadly Khojaly night, run over by tanks 
or frozen in forests, vales and mountains? Who could deprive them 
www.avciya.az- 57 -
Khojaly genocide: million signatures – one demand
of the right  to be happy,  play,  grow up, study and love given by 
God? Who could it be except Armenian butchers!? 
What  could  be  a  sin  of  tens  of  children,  the  youngest  of 
whom was 2 days old? The only sin was that they were Muslims and 
children of Azerbaijanis!   
A  bullet  hit  the  chest  of  Gulchohra,  the  wife  of  Nazim 
Hassanov, the member of Khojaly self-defence forces and went out 
through the shoulder-blade of 5-year-old Elgun tied to his mother’s 
back. Nazim’s mother Fitat was killed together with her 4-month-old 
granddaughter Aygun.   
When fire showered Khojaly from the sky, Sara Guliyeva ran 
holding her 7-year-old son Shukur by the hand together with her 13-
year-old daughter Parvana and 11-year-old Ravana. She was trying 
to save them, but she could not…They all fell to the ground…and 
froze turning into an ice lump... 
7-year-old Sevil Guliyeva, 17-year-old Zahir Mammadov, 6-
year-old  Khayala  Orujova,  Maral  Husseinova,  Natig  Azimov  and 
Aynura Zeynalova, 2-year-old Samir Guliyev, 12-year-old Sakhavat 
Alakbarov,  16-year-old  Simuzar  Humbatova,  17-year-old  Mikail 
Guliyev  and  tens  of  other  minors  and  teenagers  fell  a  victim  to 
Armenian bullets during those bloody events.   
Dozens of children died frozen in mountains,  doles, forests 
and  on  roads  having  left  their  houses  barefoot  and  bareheaded 
together with parents or without. Dozens of children and teenagers 
were taken hostage by Armenians.  
The  inhuman,  violent  murder  of  children,  women  and  the 
aged is the way of Armenian bandits. Investigation of Khojaly events 
revealed that due to criminal case № 64524, Khojaly resident Orujov 
Telman Anvar oglu was shot and then scalped by Armenians near 
Nakhichevanik  village  while  trying  to  escape  from the  blockaded 
town. Then heads of Mustafayev Vidadi Safa oglu, Nuriyev Hafiz 
Yusif oglu, Ilyasov Ahmad Mammad oglu and others were cut off. 
Baku residents Tofiq Badalov and Jabrail Rajabov were run over by

tanks.  Their  eyes  were  put  out  and  ears  cut  away.  The  body  of 
Karimova Firangul Mohammad qizi  was completely dismembered, 
her  ears  were  cut  off  and  eyes  put  out.  The  eyes  of  Tamara 
Mammadova, Asli Dadashova, Mahi Amirova, Anahat Humbatova, 
Dilara Nuraliyeva and others were put out, their teeth were pulled 
out, their breasts and other parts of their bodies were cut. After the 
bodies of Bahadir Salimov and Iqbal Aslanov were thrusted and their 
eyes were put out, they were burnt alive.  Underage Salimov Arzu 
Bahadir  oglu was tortured and killed  with a  steel  bar.  Armenians 
dissected the abdomens of some pregnant women, took out fetuses 
and throw them away. To what extent should violence stretch that

Armenians tortured and outraged hostages and captives. One 
of captives Niyaz Zeynalov, taken prisoner in his declining years and 
held captive for 2 months can imagine at once the deadly sight of 
those days as he hears even a short part of the bitter recollection: “…
After  Armenians  captured me,  they set  fire to our house with my 
mother,  aged wife and some other old people inside. When I told 
them about it,  one of them slapped me in the face. One guy from 
Shamkir shouted at them: - “Why do you hurt an old man? Stop this 
violence  against  Azerbaijani  people!”…He  jumped  at  six  armed 
Armenians and when they twisted his arms to take him out, he was 
still crying: -“You have taken Malibaily and Gushchular villages. Do 
you really think that Karabakh will be yours? No, Karabakh is ours! 
It  belongs  to  Azerbaijan!”…That  guy was knocked down and his 
www.avciya.az- 59 -

head  was  violently  cut  off  before  my  eyes…On  March  21,  six 
bearded Armenian bandits came in and saying “today is a Turkish 
holiday and we have brought you a present”, jumped at me. They 
told me to open my mouth, but I did’t…Then they shackled me and 
started beating. One of them drew a dagger and said he would cut my 
lips and tongue if I did not open my mouth. They opened my mouth 
by force and started to spit there one by one saying it is a holiday 
gift. They made me swallow down their spit. I thought it was snake 
venom in my mouth…”. 
Hundreds of Khojaly people were subjected to tortures and 
abuses while in Armenian captivity…  
The  Khojaly  massacre,  committed  with  special  violence 
riveted the attention not only of Azerbaijani journalists, but also the 
foreign press and observers and even some Armenians,  stirring up 
the sense of deep regret.  
Daud Kheiriyan  wrote in his book “In the name of Cross” 
published in 2000: “It was possible to build a bridge of corpses to 
cross the 1-kilometer  swamp near Dashbulag spring in that  frosty 
winter morning. I did not want to walk over corpses. Major Ohanyan 
gave me a sign not to fear, as a war has its own rules. I put my foot 
on the chest of 9-11-year-old girl covered with blood. My shoes and 
trousers  got  fully  dirty  with  blood.  Thus,  I  moved  over  1200 
corpses…On March 2, the “Gaflan” group (this group was dealing 
with  burning  down  corpses)  brought  about  2000  corpses  of 
disgusting Mongols (Azerbaijanis are meant) and burnt them in parts 
approximately 1 km. far from Khojaly. I saw a 10-year-old girl in the 
last truck wounded in the neck and arms. Despite the frost, hunger 
and heavy wounds, she was still alive. I will never forget the eyes of 
that child struggling with death. Then the soldier named Tigran took 
her by her ears and threw over a heap of corpses, poured with mazut. 
They were burnt out later on. At that moment I heard a yell coming 
www.avciya.az- 60 -
Khojaly genocide: million signatures – one demand
from under the burning corpses and begging for help.  I could not 
walk any more. But I had to liberate sacred Shusha cursed by Turks. 
Therefore, I returned…And they continued their march in the name 
of  Cross”.  Look,  how  openly  just  a  small  part  of  this  book 
demonstrates Armenian vice! 
Yuri  Pompeyev  writes  in  his  work  “Bloody  Karabakh 
whirlpool”: “Only the dead remained in Khojaly” – “Moscovskiye 
novosti” (“Moscow news”) informed the world about Khojaly events 
with  sorrow.  “God  seems  to  have  really  died”.  Correspondent 
Viktoriya  Ivleva  was  by  her  own admission  going  in  the  second 
wave of the storm.  Approaching Khojaly she felt  that  “something 
looking like a cloud” was moving towards her. It was the cloud of 
half-naked people: “Three barefoot women with kids were the last 
coming over the snow. They could hardly move and often fell down. 
The youngest of their children was a 2-day-old baby. I could watch 
the further fate of this woman and her children on a TV reel recorded 
by a cameraman and full with sobbing voices. The “cloud” was shot 
down on a slope… People were stretching their hands to God, turned 
away from them…”.  
Just  look at  the  name of  Ivleva  –  Viktoriya!  Four  selfless 
braves stand on fallen “Azeris” in one of the photos: fascists inspired 
with the feeling of victory took such pictures in front of prostrate 
bodies…”.   
Jan-iv  Yunet,  the  French  journalist: “We  were  the 
witnesses of  the Khojaly  tragedy.  We saw hundreds of  corpses of  
murdered peaceful people – the corpses of women, children, the old  
and the defenders of Khojaly. We were given a helicopter and could 
record everything  we saw from a bird's-eye view.  But  Armenians  
started firing at our helicopter and we could not finish filming. It  
was  a  terrible  sight  there.  I  have  heard  much  about  wars  and 
despotism of  German fascists,  but  Armenians  killing  5-6-year-old  
children  and  peaceful  population  surpassed  them.  We  saw  large 
www.avciya.az- 61 -
Khojaly genocide: million signatures – one demand
quantity  of  wounded  people  in  hospitals,  carriages  and  even  in  
kindergartens and schools”.  
Rori Patrick, the journalist, the English “Front line news” 
TV Company: “Nothing can excuse the Khojaly crime in the world  
society’s opinion. I saw many mutilated corpses from a helicopter  
taking journalists to Nakhichevanik village. They were the Khojaly  
defenders and civil population, including women, children and the  
aged  shot  by  Armenian  armed  gangs  while  trying  to  escape  to  
Agdam”. 
Anatol  Levin,  the  journalist,  Great  Britain: “When  we 
approached  the  snow-covered  hills  of  Nagorno-Karabakh  on  a 
helicopter,  we  saw corpses  scattered  everywhere.  We  understood 
that they were refugees, shot while trying to escape”. 
V. Belikh,  the “Izvestiya” correspondent: “…Sometimes,  
corpses exchanged for live hostages were brought to Agdam. But it  
cannot appear even in a nightmare: pricked eyes, cut off ears, rawed 
skin and severed heads…the tortures overstepped all the bounds”.  
The  “Krua  I’Evenam”  (Paris),  25  March,  1992. 
“Armenians  attacked  the  place  named Khojaly.  The  whole  world  
saw  the  mutilated  corpses.  Azerbaijanis  inform  on  thousands  of  
murdered…”.  
The  “Sunday  Times”  (London),  1  March,  1992. 
“Armenian soldiers annihilated hundreds of families”.    
The  “Financial  Times”  (London),  9  March,  1992. 
“Armenians shot down a group of refugees, moving towards Agdam.  
Azerbaijanis counted 1200 corpses”.  
The “Times” newspaper (London), 4 March, 1992. “Many 
were mutilated. One little girl had only her head left”.   
The  “Izvestiya”  (Moscow),  4  March,  1992. “A  camera 
showed children with cut off ears. The half-face of one old woman  
was cut away. Men were scalped.   
The  “Financial  Times”  (London),  14  March,  1992. 
“Foreign journalists saw in Agdam the corpses of people killed in  
www.avciya.az- 62 -

Khojaly.  There  were  three  scalped  corpses  with  pulled  out  nails  
among the murdered women and children. It is not the Azerbaijani  
propaganda, it is the reality”.  
The “Izvestiya” (Moscow), 13 March, 1992. Major Leonid 
Kravetz: “…On  February  26,  I  took  out  the  wounded  from 
Stepanakert  and  returned  to  Askeran.  I  saw  some  strange  spots  
below. As I lost height, my flight engineer shouted: “Look, there are  
women  and  children  there”.  Now,  I  could  see  myself  about  200  
corpses spread over the hill.  Some armed people were wandering 
among them...We attempted to pick up some dead bodies during the  
next flight. One Azerbaijani captain was accompanying us. I have  
forgotten his name. He saw there his 3-year-old son with the crashed  
head and went mad. We could take the corpse of a boy without head 
before the fire started.  I saw the violently murdered and mutilated  
bodies of women, children and aged people everywhere.”   
The “Valer actuel” magazine (Paris), 14 March, 1922. “In 
this  autonomous  region,  Armenian  troops,  including  mercenaries  
from the Middle East possess the most modern military equipment  
and helicopters. The ASALA has army camps and ammunition depots  
in Syria and Lebanon. Having assaulted over a hundred of villages,  
Armenians annihilated the Karabakh Azerbaijanis”.  
“Sunday Times” (London), 08 March 1992. “Khojaly used 
to be a barren Azeri town, with empty shops and treeless dirt roads.  
Yet it was still home to thousands of Azeri people who, in happier  
times, tended fields and flocks of geese. Last week it was wiped off  
the map.”
The Times, London, 03 March 1992. Massacre uncovered 
By  Anatol  Lieven:  More  than  sixty  bodies,  including  those  of  
women and children,  have  been  spotted  on  hillsides  in  Nagorno-
Karabakh, confirming claims that Armenian troops massacred Azeri  
refugees. Hundreds are missing”
www.avciya.az- 63 -

The Sunday Times 1 March 1992. “Survivors reported that  
Armenian soldiers shot and bayoneted more than 450 Azeris, many 
of them women and children.  Hundreds, possibly thousands, were 
missing and feared dead. 'They were shooting, shooting, shooting,'  
echoed Rasia Aslanova, who arrived in Agdam with other women 
and children who made their way through Armenian lines. She said 
her husband, Kayun, and a son-in-law were massacred in front of  
her. Her daughter was still missing.”
The  Washington  Post,  28  February  1992. Nagorno-
Karabagh Victims Buried in Azerbaijani Town: "Refugees claim 
hundreds died in Armenian Attack...Of seven bodies seen here today,  
two were children and three were women, one shot through the chest  
at  what  appeared  to  be close  range.  Another  120 refugees  being 
treated  at  Agdam's  hospital  include  many  with  multiple  stab  
wounds."
This is a tiny part of the cruelest genocide of the XX century 
–  the  Khojaly  massacre  committed  in  this  Azeri  town  against 
children,  women  and  aged  people,  displaying  the  savagery  of 
Armenians.

CRIME AGAINST HUMANITY
KHOJALY…. FIFTEEN YEARS PASSED
The appeal of victims of Khojaly genocide to international 
organizations, international courts, states and the people of the 
world
    We, the relatives of the people died as a result of Khojaly 
genocide, the victims of the aggressive and ethnical purge politics of 
Armenia  would  like  to  apply  to  YOU.  We  want  to  attract  your 
attention to the cruelty of Armenians who had no mercy on children, 
women  and  old  people.  We  want  to  draw  your  attention  to  the 
actions of Armenian soldiers who killed with no mercy hundreds of 
inhabitants of Khojaly just for being Azeri. 
    Armenian troops under the command of R. Kocharyan, the 
today’s  President  of Armenia  and A.  Gukasyan,  the leader  of the 
occupation and separatist regime in Nagorno-Karabagh attacked on 
the night of February 26 the Azerbaijan Khojaly town and started 
mass  destruction  of  its  inhabitants.  613  people,  including  63 
children,  106  women  and  70  old  people  were  brutally  killed;  8 
families were totally whipped out; 25 children lost their both parents, 
130  children  lost  one  of  their  parent;  487  people,  including  76 
children  were  heavily  wounded;  1275 people  were  taken prisoner 
and150 of them are considered missing.
    We ask you not to be indifferent to this awful tragedy, to 
give the estimation to the genocide, the crime committed not only 
against Khojaly people, but also against humanity on the whole, and 
punish  the  people  guilty  of  this  bloody  crime.  We  call  on  the 
international society not to believe to the false tears of the Armenian 
criminals,  and  judge  their  actions  as  a  a  genocide  act  against 
Azerbaijan people. 
The survived inhabitants of Khojaly town

… Long 15 years…15 years since the day of tragedy, which 
makes  blood  boil,  hearts  freeze  and  conscience  refuse  to 
understand…
In  October  1991,  Armenians  cut  off  the  road  connecting 
Khojaly with Agdam and it was possible to get to the town only by 
helicopter:  short  flight  to  Agdam  and  then  harsh  cork  –  screw 
lowering. When in January, American journalist Thomas Goltz made 
this awful trip, he saw cold and unprotected town. “In Khojaly the 
telephones did not work, absolutely nothing worked, there was no 
water,  no  electricity,  and  no  heating”  wrote  Goltz.  –  Helicopters 
were  the  only  link  with  the  outside  world  and  each  trip  was 
dangerous”. By February 13, 1992, when the last flight to Khojaly 
was made,  less than 300 inhabitants  had been evacuated,  but still 
there were 3000 people. The defense of Khojaly was provided by the 
commander  of  SPAM  airport  Alef  Hajiev  and  about  160  lightly 
armed  militiamen.  The  inhabitants  were  waiting  for  the  attack  of 
Armenians.  The  storm  started  on  the  night  of  February  25-26. 
Armenians were supported by motorized infantry regiment 366, the 
regiment of Soviet Army. They surrounded Khojaly from three sides 
and after that, Armenian soldiers entered the town and put down the 
resistance of defenders. 
Late at night, a big crowd of people started to flee across the 
snowy forest down to the valley of the Gargar River.  Early in the 
morning, the inhabitants of Khojaly reached the plain not far from 
the Armenian  Nakhichevanik  village.  Here,  they were met  by the 
Armenian  militants.  613  people  were  killed.  63  of  them  were 
children; 106- women; the old – 70. 
8  families  were totally  whipped out;  25  children  lost  both 
parents; 130 children lost one of the parents; 487 people, including 
76 children were wounded; 1275 were taken hostage; 150 people are 
missing.
Hijran  Alakbarova,  the  former  Khojaly  inhabitant  told  a 
representative  of  the  “Human  Rights  Watch”:  “We  reached 
www.avciya.az- 66 -
Khojaly genocide: million signatures – one demand
Nakhichevanik about 9 o’clock in the morning. There was a field full 
with many killed people. I think there were about 100 people. I did 
not try to count them. I was wounded just in this field. Hadjiev Alef 
was shot, and I wanted to help him. A bullet hit me to the stomach. I 
saw where they were shooting from. I also saw many corpses in this 
field. They were still warm – the color of their face did not change 
yet”.   
Journalists  and investigators  who arrived here after  several 
days saw a cruel picture of bloody battle.  Emboweled corpses were 
everywhere  over  the frozen land.  Anatol  Levin from the “Times” 
wrote that “some of them, including a little girl had awful wounds in 
their bodies and the girls had only her face remained”. Besides those 
who died of gunshot wounds, scores of people died of cold and frost 
in the forests. No less than a thousand of Khojaly inhabitants were 
taken  prisoner,  including  several  tens  of  Meskhetian  Turks  and 
refugees from Middle East. 
The testimonies of victims are unexampled
3-year-old Shovqi  Aliev was taken hostage on January 24, 
1993,  during  the  occupation  of  Agdam.  Armenian  “doctors”  in 
Khankandy cut  his  forearm bones  and as  a  result,  Shovqi  Aliyev 
became invalid. 
Arzu Hadjiev – the newborn sun of Guldjamal Gulieva, who 
was  taken  hostage  on  March  31,  1993  during  the  occupation  of 
Kalbadjar  region.  Armenian  “doctor”  Aida  Serobyan  made  the 
injection of an unknown composition and as a result, Arzu Hadjiev 
became invalid and died in May 2003. 
Mail  Mammadov was taken hostage  on October  21,  1992. 
Armenians branded cross on Mail’s chest. 
Abdulazim Mammadov – being wounded, was taken hostage 
on December 26, 1991.  He was tortured, beaten with a rubber club 
and given petrol injections into his veins.

Ilham Nasirov - while kept in Armenian prison over a year, 
was deprived of any food and as a result, died on November 23, 1993 
(of starvation). 
Fikret  Gusseinov.  In  1993,  he  was  violently  tortured  and 
killed in prison by Armenians. 
Anvar Djafarov - was killed in prison in 1994. 
Gulshad Mammadov. In 1994, he was shot in prison in the 
head. 
Rustam Agayev - shot in the head in prison in 1994.
The  results  of  the  forensic  medical  examination  of  the 
remains of Farhad Atakishiev, who died in Armenian prison, prove 
that he had died of heavy tortures and regular beatings. 
Amirova  Khazangul  Tavakkul  qizi  was  taken  hostage 
during the occupation of Khojaly town (26.12.1992)
On the night of February 25 - 26, 1992, the Khojaly tragedy 
happened.  The  armed  Armenians,  who  attacked  town,  took  us  
hostage in the forest. My sister Yegana and my mother Raya were  
shot by Armenians. We together with other prisoners and hostages  
were taken to Askeran. Here, Armenians tied my father to a tree and  
tried to make him say: “Azerbaijan is a land of Armenians”. But my 
father said: “Even with at the price of my life I won’t sell my land to 
Armenians”. Armenians poured petrol over him and burnt his legs.  
But my father was repeating: “Even if you kill me and my children,  
we won’t give you our lands. Azerbaijan is our land”. After all this,  
they burnt my father alive.
Azizov Ramil Ibrahim oglu was taken hostage during the 
occupation of Khojaly (26/02/1992)
Late at night, during the storm of Khojaly town, my father  
Ibrahim and elder brother Elmin, who had returned from the post,  
took us out of home. Trying to break through the circle, we ran to the  
forest towards Agdam. On the way to Nakhichevanik village, we ran 
into the firing. My old mother fell a victim of this firing. She died in  
the forest. Takhir was wounded and also died in the forest. The man 
www.avciya.az- 68 -

named Elkhan tried to save a little girl of 3 or 4. But he could not go  
even  10  meters  when  the  little  girl  in  his  arms  was  shot  by  
Armenians  and  Elkhan  himself  was  wounded.  In  the  forest  
Armenians shot the defenseless inhabitants of the town – my uncle  
Alakbarov Tavakkul, his wife Saadat and Gasanbala with his wife  
were among them. 
Mamedov Mail Mamedali oglu was kept in the Armenian 
prison from 21.10.1992 till 07.05.1993
When I was in prison of Gadrut town, the Armenian militants  
put us in a row.  Then Armenians named Artur and Vadik and one  
black bully laid me onto the ground and branded a cross on my chest  
with  a  scorching  bar.  After  that,  a  black  man  tortured  me  by 
stepping on my burnt chest.
While kept in Gadrut, a brutally beaten and wounded Azeri  
guy  was  thrown into  my camera.  That  guy  was  all  covered  with  
blood. Her hands were tied. After some time, the Armenian militants  
coming into the camera started brutally beat him with sticks, despite  
he was wounded. Then he was dragged out into the corridor and his  
head was cut off. The cut head was thrown again into the camera. 
Daud Kheyriyan, the author of the book, “In the name of 
Cross” published in Beirut by the “Ash Sharq” publishing house 
tells on pages 19 - 76 about the battle in Khojaly. “…. Suddenly  
we stepped on corpses…To cross a swamp near the Dashbulaq we  
made a bridge of corpses. I did not want to walk on the corpses.  
Then major Ohanyan gave me the sign not to be afraid, as it was one  
of the signs of war. I put my foot on the bloody chest of a girl of 10  
and moved ahead…My legs,  my photo camera,  all  were in blood  
(page  24)…On March  2,  the  Armenian  “Gaflan”  group (dealing  
with burning out corpses) picked up about 100 corpses of Turks and 
then burnt them a kilometer away to the west of Khojaly. In the last  
car, I saw a girl of 10; she was wounded in her forehead and arms.  
This child with the blue face was still alive despite cold, starvation 
and the wounds. She was slowly breathing.  I could not forget the

eyes  of  that  little  girl  struggling  for  life.  Then  a  soldier  named 
Tigranyan  took  motionless  little  girl  and  threw  her  over  the  
corpses…Later on they were burnt….It seemed to me that someone 
screaming among the burning corpses asking for help….” (pages 62  
- 63).
Gavrilov  is  writing  in  “Military  Bulletin”  (Publishing 
house St. Petersburg, 1998, page.  96): “On March 10, 1992, the 
President of Russian Federation Boris Yeltsin received a letter from  
Minister  of  Interior  Victor  Yerin  (“Oaylar”).  The  minister  was  
writing about Khojaly stating that he will talk comprehensively when  
they  meet  personally  and  he  asked  him  to  watch  the  video  tape 
attached to the letter. The video-tape showed the actions of the 336th  
regiment  with  the  staff  of  1890  people  and  the  shots  of  Khojaly  
tragedy.  General Yein was writing to Yeltsin: “….In Khojaly,  the  
women, children, and old people were shot down. They scalped the  
men.  According  to  the  military  intelligence,  this  information  was 
given by some Mustafaev, the film documentalist, who was accusing  
the  366th  regiment,  located  in  Nagorno-Karabagh  of  the  
massacre…”
Then he writes that after Elchin saw the tape, he signed the 
special  order  (0219/21.  –  OD –  1992.  III.  12),  which  banned  to 
receive the shots that could damage the honor and dignity of Russian 
soldiers. One of the basic goals to reach the target was to expand the 
intelligence net in the conflict zone. 
 The “Zerkalo” newspaper published the material  about the 
actions of Armenian barbarians in Khojaly and the direct role of the 
motorized 366th regiment.  This article includes the letter of colonel 
Savelyev  to  the  Kremlin  regarding  the  actions  of  Armenian  and 
Russian militants in Khojaly:
 “I do not have any desire to keep silence on the facts that  
happened in front of my eyes. I can not forget the shot children and 
the  old,  as  well  as  pregnant  women.  May  the  Azerbaijan  people  
forgive me that I wasn’t in power to stop these bloody events. 
www.avciya.az- 70 -
Khojaly genocide: million signatures – one demand
I  am  sending  the  secret  information  on  19  pages  to  the  
Kremlin,  the international  organizations  and generals  of  the HID 
(Head Intelligence  Department).  The honor of  Russian soldiers  is  
stained. 
Col. E. Zarvigarov, the commander of the motorized 366th  
regiment and other responsible people, with the permit of the Army 
district command joined Armenians. 
Thus, they brought 49 Azeris to the square and shot them.  
There was a case when I could not help a girl of 8 – 10 and who was  
just 10 steps away from me and shot, but I could not help her.”
The people who directly participated in the disbandment of  
the  regiment  and  handing  over  arms  to  Armenians:  Col.-Gen.  
Gromov,  Lieu.–Gen  Grekov,  Lieu.–  Gen.  Ogonyan,  deputy  
Andronov, Col. E. Zarvigarov (General afterwards), Col. Kraule…
The  fourth  army  created  the  circumstances  for  the 
participation of soldiers of the 23rd motorized imfantry division in 
Khojaly operation. 
Those  days  Armenians  –  the  staff  of  the  “Operator  -  II”  
studio  (Jule  Barelyan,  and  Sherik  Sitaryan)  from  France  were 
filming the burning of the corpses of Azeris died in Khojaly. 
Regarding to the officer Ivan Karabelnikov, it happened in a  
small hilly place in the north – east of Khojaly…
Having picked up the corpses of the killed Azeris, they put  
them to a “KamAZ” № “02 – 19 MM”, and then kindled big fire.  
Hatred is in the nature of Armenians. It has no bounds. I can not  
understand whence this hatred comes from. Here is the list of some 
officers  who  joined  Armenians  and  murdered  Azeris  with  great  
pleasure one by one: the deputy commander of the regiment for rear  
services  Baylukov,  the commander of  the 1st  battalion,  Col.  I.  V.  
Moiseev, the commander of the 2nd    battalion, major S.I. Ogonyan;  
the commander of the 3rd battalion, major Nabokikh, the chief of the  
1st  battalion’s  headquarters,  major  Chigichyan;  the  chief  of  an 
intelligence  regiment,  major  V.G.  Ayriyan;  the  commander  of  a  
www.avciya.az- 71 -
Khojaly genocide: million signatures – one demand
company, senior lieutenant O. V. Mirzokhalzarov; the chief  of the  
platoon  intelligence,  senior  lieutenant  S.V.  Khrinkhua;  the  
commander of a tank company, senior lieutenant V.N. Garmash; the 
commander  of  a  company,  senior  lieutenant  N.T.  Akopyan;  the  
commander  of  a  company,  senior  lieutenant  V.I.  Vavilovski;  the 
commander  of  a  platoon,  senior  lieutenant  A.B.  Lisenko;  the 
commander  of  a  battery,  senior  lieutenant  V.A.  Azarov;  the 
commander  of  the  3rd  tank  company,  lieutenant  O.V.  Balezniy;  
lieutenant A.V. Smakin; lieutenant S.I. Rachkovski; deputy chief of  
the intelligence, lieutenant L.I. Bondarev; lieutenant A.I. Kulov and 
41 Armenian militaries from the junior officer staff. 
    Some facts of Armenian brutalities were withdrawn from 
Savelyev’s report, because a normal person can not just read them 
calmly. 
    The Armenian pilots received the helicopters on February 
19,  and  this  air  squadron  was  included  into  the  motorized  366th 
regiment on February 22. 
Here is the list of the helicopters and their personal staff 
that bombed Khojaly
Helicopter  № 39:  pilot  Romb Galakchiyan  – the  Armenian 
from Lebanon, the profession engineer;
Helicopter № 40: pilot Razdan Minoyan – the Armenian from 
Syria, the engineer;
Helicopter № 29: pilot Zahid al – Muhammed – the citizen of  
Lebanon, the member of “Hamas”;
Helicopter № 17: pilot Ararat Saradjyan – the military from 
Yerevan; 
Helicopter  № 45  pilot  Pirimyan  Suren  – the  officer  of  the 
Yerevan militia.
www.avciya.az- 72 -
Khojaly genocide: million signatures – one demand
These  helicopters  were  bombing  Khojaly  on  February  26 
from 16.00 to 24.00. 
On February  28,  Z.al  – Muhammed  and S.  Pirimyan  were 
awarded with the “Golden Cross” for the active participation in the 
operation.  
Today, when 15 years has passed since this event, Armenians 
do not  deny anymore  that  during the  escape  from Khojaly,  many 
peaceful  Khojaly  inhabitants  died.  Some  people  blame  Armenian 
volunteers  allegedly  acting  without  permission.  The  officer  of 
Armenian  police  Major  Valery  Babayan  told  American  journalist 
Paul- Queen Judge that personal revenge was the major motive of 
those events. 
When Armenian military chief was asked to talk about the 
capture of Khojaly, he carefully said: “We prefer not to talk about it  
aloud.  But  I  think  the  basic  matter  is  a  different  point.  Before 
Khojaly,  Azeris  thought  that  they could play games with us; they  
thought that Armenians could not lift hand on peaceful inhabitants.  
We could break this stereotype”. 
The estimation of Sarkisyan allows viewing the cruel struggle 
in  Karabagh  differently.  It  is  not  improbable  that  these  massive 
murders were in part the intentional act of frightening.
From  the  report  of  the  independent  investigation  of  the 
“Memorial”  association  regarding  the  massive  breach  of  human 
rights:
“The  places  of  massive  death  of  refugees,  as  well  as  the 
corpses of  the dead were filmed.  Watching these images, one can 
understand that the corpses of dead people were dispersed over a  
big area. There were the corpses of women, the old and children.  
Several  of  corpses  had  the  signs  of  tortures.  The  officials  of  
Nagorno-Karabakh told the observers of “Memorial” that “120 –  
130  corpses  were  taken  to  Agdam”.  96  corpses  were  buried  in  
Agdam; the other corpses were taken by their relatives. 
www.avciya.az- 73 -
Khojaly genocide: million signatures – one demand
While calculating the general number of the dead people in 
Khojaly,  it  is  very  important  to  take  into  the  consideration  that  
people died not only of bullets, but also of frostbite while wandering  
in the mountains.  The observers of “Memorial” talked to a woman 
who lost  her  three  children  by  this  way.  To  determine  the  exact  
number  of  frozen  people  is  impossible.  Due  to  the  information 
received  from  both  sides,  by  28  March  1992,  more  than  700  
prisoners from Khojaly had been given back to the Azerbaijan side.  
Women and children were the majority”.
During  inspection  by  the  “Memorial”  observers  in 
Stepanakert,  where the Khojaly inhabitants  were kept prisoners,  it 
was  determined  that  the keeping conditions  were  not  satisfactory. 
According to verbal information, the prisoners were beaten regularly. 
It is worth to state that observers were given permission to examine 
only a part of the prisoners.
The  chief  of  the  Temporary  Detention  Places  major 
Khachaturyan didn’t allow talking to the prisoners privately, even for 
few  minutes.  It  was  possible  to  have  one  conversation  by  pure 
accident.
According  to  the  testimony  of  the  prisoners  and  then 
exchanged inhabitants and defenders of Khojaly, men were beaten; 
there is testimony which was confirmed by the doctors of Baku and 
Agdam about rape, even of the minors. 
Escaping inhabitants of Khojaly did not have an opportunity 
to  take  with  them even  the  minimum of  necessary  property.  The 
inhabitants of Khojaly who were taken by Armenian military were 
not given an opportunity to take the part of their property. 
The abandoned properties were taken away by the inhabitants 
of Stepanakert and nearest settlements. On the gates of many houses 
were written the surnames of the new owners.
Regarding  to  the  decision  of  the  Supreme  Council  of  the 
Republic  of  Nagorno- Karabagh,  Khojaly must  be populated  with 
needy  Armenians,  for  this  the  numbers  were  given  to  them.  The 
www.avciya.az- 74 -
Khojaly genocide: million signatures – one demand
Supreme Council of the NKR made a statement and expressed their 
regret regarding the brutal events happened during the occupation of 
Khojaly.  But  not  any  attempts  were  taken  regarding  to  the 
investigation of crimes connected with the occupation of Khojaly. 
During the conversation of the observers of “Memorial” with 
the officials, they did not deny that during the occupation of Khojaly 
the  acts  of  cruelty  might  happen,  as  among  the  members  of  the 
Armenian armed military were the embittered people whose relatives 
were killed by Azeris.  
THE EVALUATION OF THE RECEIVED EVIDENCES
While  realizing  the  military  occupation  of  Khojaly  town, 
there were massive aggressions on the peaceful inhabitants of town. 
The information regarding the presence of the “free corridor” 
was not given to the major mass of Khojaly inhabitants. 
After the occupation of Khojaly by Armenian militarists the 
peaceful inhabitants were deported. These actions were realized in an 
organized manner,  most of deported were detained in Stepanakert, 
which was evidently stated by appropriate orders of the authorities of 
NKR. 
The massive killing of the peaceful inhabitants who were in 
the zone of “free corridor” and in the bordering territory could not be 
justified at any circumstances. 
Seizure and holding of the peaceful inhabitant of Khojaly as 
“hostages”, as well as women, was in contrast with the statement of 
the officials of NKR to be ready to pass all peaceful inhabitants of 
Khojaly to Azerbaijani side. The condition of holding the “hostages” 
was  not  satisfactory;  there  was  also  violence  on  the  detained 
inhabitants of Khojaly. 
The inhabitants of Khojaly were illegally deprived from their 
property  and  given  to  the  inhabitants  of  Stepanakert  and  other 
settlements.  The  authorities  of  the  NKR  legalized  such  kind  of 
www.avciya.az- 75 -
Khojaly genocide: million signatures – one demand
appropriation  of  another’s  property  and  gave  them orders  for  the 
eviction  of  house,  which  belonged  to  escaped  and  deported 
inhabitants of Khojaly. 
Remedial center “Memorial” states that during the storm in 
Khojaly  the  acts  of  the  Armenian  militarists  formed  in  Nagorno-
Karabagh towards  the  peaceful  inhabitants  of  Khojaly is  in  crude 
contrast  with  Geneva  Convention,  as  well  as  with  the  following 
articles of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (accepted by 
General Assembly of the UN, 10.12.1948):
Article 2, Everyone is entitled to all the rights and freedoms 
set forth in this Declaration, without distinction of any kind, such as 
race,  color,  sex,  language,  religion,  political  or  other  opinion, 
national or social origin, property, birth or other status. Furthermore, 
no  distinction  shall  be  made  on  the  basis  of  the  political, 
jurisdictional  or  international  status  of  the  country  or  territory  to 
which a person belongs, whether it  is independent,  trust,  non-self-
governing or under any other limitation of sovereignty. 
Article 3, Everyone has the right to life, liberty and security 
of person. 
Article  5, No one shall  be subjected to torture or to cruel, 
inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment. 
Article  9,  No  one  shall  be  subjected  to  arbitrary  arrest, 
detention or exile. 
Article 17, Everyone has the right to own property alone and 
no one shall be arbitrarily deprived of his property. 
The actions of the armed militarists are in contrast with the 
Declaration  on  the  Protection  of  Women  and  Children  in 
Emergencies  and  Armed  Conflicts  (was  proclaimed  by  General 
Assembly of the UN, 14.12.1974), in which it says:
“Women and children  belonging  to  the  civilian  population 
and finding themselves in circumstances of emergency and armed 
conflict  in  the  struggle  for  peace,  self-determination,  national 
liberation and independence, or who live in occupied territories, shall 
www.avciya.az- 76 -
Khojaly genocide: million signatures – one demand
not  be  deprived  of  shelter,  food,  medical  aid  or  other  inalienable 
rights,  in  accordance  with  the  provisions  of  the  Universal 
Declaration of Human Rights, the International  Covenant on Civil 
and Political Rights, the International Covenant on Economic, Social 
and Cultural Rights, the Declaration of the Rights of the Child or 
other instruments of international law”.
    As a result of the Second World War, new word genocide 
appeared in lexicon. After many scores passed International Tribunal 
for Rwanda called genocide “the crime of crimes”. In 1945 this term 
was used in the legal practice – in the Nierenberg process over the 
Nazi military criminals. On December 9, 1948 the General Assembly 
of  the  UN  accepted  “the  Convention  on  the  Prevention  and 
Punishment  of the Crime of Genocide”.  The Convention confirms 
that genocide, whether committed in time of peace or in time of war, 
is  a  crime  under  international  law.  Genocide  means  any  of  the 
following acts committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, 
a national, ethnical, racial or religious group, as such: 
(a) Killing members of the group;
(b) Causing serious bodily or mental  harm to members  of the 
group; 
(c)  Deliberately  inflicting  on  the  group  conditions  of  life 
calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in 
part; 
(d)  Imposing  measures  intended  to  prevent  births  within  the 
group; 
(e) Forcibly transferring children of the group to another group. 
The convention also confirms, the following acts shall be punishable:
 
(a) Genocide; 
(b) Conspiracy to commit genocide; 
(c) Direct and public incitement to commit genocide; 
(d) Attempt to commit genocide; 
www.avciya.az- 77 -
Khojaly genocide: million signatures – one demand
(e) Complicity in genocide. 
Genocide is always organized: In most cases, it happens with 
the representatives of state, rarely in the informal ways, for example, 
with  the  help  of  the  militarized  or  religious  organizations.  Units, 
bands and mobs of people which realize the genocide are as a rule, 
armed or trained beforehand. In this phase the plan of murdering is 
preparing, for example, “the blacklist” is preparing. The Organizing 
Party of Genocide ALWAYS denies the fact of genocide. Organizing 
Party of Genocide always blocks the investigation of these crimes. 
For  the  crime  of  Genocide  the  presence  of  the  special 
intention  is  a  very  necessary  element.  This  objective  point 
distinguishes the genocide from other analogical crimes. Every act 
which  makes  the  crime  of  genocide  appears  to  be  conscious  and 
forethought. Here, it is very important to figure out special direction 
of  criminal  intend  connected  with  the  negative  results  of  acts. 
Shooting  from  gun,  machine  gun  and  other  kind  of  guns,  the 
organized ambushed of Azerbaijan civil inhabitants who wanted to 
escape proves the intention of Genocide.
For the qualification of the crime as Genocide, the final result 
as a destruction of whole group is not needed. For this it is enough to 
realize one of the acts  which contains the intention to destroy the 
ethnical group as a whole or partly. The term of destruction is a part 
of  the  genocide,  means  killing  through  physical  and  biological 
influence. 
It is fact that this crime is against Azerbaijan national group. 
While  analyzing  the  crime  of  Genocide,  its  3  parts  come out:  1) 
presence of the famous national, ethnical, race or religious group; 2) 
presence of the intention to destroy such group in a whole or partly; 
3) realizing towards of famous group one of the acts which considers 
as genocide. 
The  International  Court  recognized  the  principles,  which 
contain  the  fundament  of  the  convention  “The  Prevention  and 
www.avciya.az- 78 -
Khojaly genocide: million signatures – one demand
Punishment of the Crime of Genocide” as a norms of justice cogent 
for all states. 
The Khojaly Genocide entered the Azerbaijan history forever. 
The  Genocide  act  was  realized  in  Khojaly.  We know it.  But  the 
world does not know about it. And will hardly ever know if we do 
not publish books and extend materials. 
With the assistance of Azerbaijan Military Prosecutor 
Khanlar Veliyev, we introduce the list of people who perpetrated the 
military crimes against peace and humanity, with respect to whom 
the criminal cases were bring and the investigation is conducting:

ARMENIAN POLITICS AND AZERBAIJANIS
BLOODY PAGES OF HISTORY
…There is a wide memorial plate attached to the wall at the 
entrance  to  “20  January”  Baku  city  metro  station.  There  are  the 
names of 14 people lost in a terrorist act committed on 19 March, 
1994 -  a  day before the dearest  for Azerbaijanis  Novruz bayrami 
(spring holiday)  – in an electric wag. This, perhaps,  is one of the 
absurds of history: in 1990, 20 January in “20 January” square under 
the  name  of  “Soviet  soldiers”  reserve  soldiers  and  officers  of 
Armenian  origin  from  Stavropol  region  and  Rostov  province 
committed massacres on 20 January,  having shot and smashed the 
civilians and four years later Armenian terrorist groups had a hand in 
this bloody act at the metro station “20 January”. The memorial plate 
is  just  a  little  part  to  commemorate  the  people  died  during  this 
terrorist act of all Armenians’ victims. It is impossible to place all the 
names of Azerbaijanis – victims of the dirty Armenian politics on 
one list, a plate, a memorial. As there are hundred thousands of them. 
The names of innocent people being killed may be commemorated 
only on the bloody pages of history.
The terrorist act in “20 January” metro station was committed 
under leadership of XXO Armenian organization.  Other 13 people 
died  in  a  terrorist  act  committed  between  the  metro  stations  “28 
May”  and  “Ganjlik”  in  1994,  3  July.  Azerbaijanis  are  the  nation 
living with all the bloody consequences of Armenian terror as similar 
acts are numerously taking places in passenger buses, trains, ships, 
planes. Moreover, no one may guarantee that Armenians won’t use 
these anti-human methods. Thus, in history, since XIX century, 90s 
“Armenian affair” becomes a daily issue at an artificial speed when 
hundreds of terrorist acts have been committed with always innocent 
people  suffered.  During  the  same  period  Azerbaijanis  turned  to 
become aims for not only Armenian terrorists but also for Armenian 
www.avciya.az- 89 -

army,  armed  troops.  They  have  the  only  aim:  to  drive  out 
Azerbaijanis from the lands historically inhabited and to create an 
Armenian state on the freed lands.
The borders of “state” named by Armenian ideologists “Great 
Armenia” with new maps drawed from time to time stretch from the 
Black Sea until the Caspian.  They consider Turks and Azerbaijanis 
as the only obstacle. In order to achieve the goals they are ready to 
use  every  anti-human  means.  Armenian  writer  Silva  Kaputikyan 
writes in his book “For the first time…”: “Hayk must be aware that a 
child born into an Armenian family loving the God was not born to 
live but to help the Armenian nation. That is why you should loudly, 
very loudly shout into an ear of an Armenian just-born child: “Ey, 
Aram…  Turk  is  your  enemy…  Motherland  is  more  than  God. 
Church is more than Motherland. Great Tigran is more than Church. 
“Great Armenia” is more than Great Tigran”. In order to realize this 
ideology  all  the  Turk  nations,  Azerbaijanis,  Georgians,  Kurds, 
Lezghi,  Jewish  and  other  neighbouring  nationalities  have  faced 
terrorist acts, bloody wars of Armenians. This appears not only in 
material damage but also in spiritual aggression. Armenian historians 
and ideologists falsifying the history are even now trying to confuse 
the  international  community  with  placing  their  names  on  other 
nations’  particular  historical  memorials,  and  unfortunately  that  is 
being achieved from time to time. This appears openly during the 
process  of  “recognition  of  genocide”.  Great  Georgian  writer  Ilia 
Chavchavadze  wrote  with  heart  pain  in  his  book  “Armenian 
scientists  and  crying  stones”  that  Armenians  are  trying  to  attract 
attention  of  the  whole  world  to  them,  meanwhile  Georgian 
memorials  and stones with Georgian inscriptions  are  crying about 
being appropriated. Similar reasoning may be come across with in 
the  book  by  Vasil  Velichko  “The  Caucasus”,  who  edited  “The 
Caucasus” newspaper published in Tbilisi. We may also assert that 
since its origination “the Armenian issue” as a lexical term, having 
lost  its  political  meaning,  is  being  conceived  only  as  terror  and 
www.avciya.az- 90 -

destruction,  and  this  in  its  turn  is  not  of  a  casual  and  natural 
character.  Because,  three  parties  –  Armenakan,  Khinchak  and 
Dashnaktsyutyun which brought misfortunes and tragedies not only 
for other nations but also Armenians, since first days of foundation 
stated in their programs about “a revolutionary way” being chosen. 
For example,  the party Armenakan founded in 1885 stated that its 
prime aim was to set an Armenian state in a revolutionary way. With 
the  same  aim  they  founded  branch  parties  in  Istanbul,  Iran, 
Transcaucasia,  cities  in  Eastern  Anatolia  and  United  States  of 
America.  The  party  sent  weapon  to  Eastern  Anatolia,  created 
resistance groups, committed political crimes of Kurds and Turks in 
secret  ways.  The  party  Khinchak,  founded  in  1887  in  Geneva, 
Switzerland on the grounds of Marxists’ ideology used the methods 
“propaganda, agitation, terror” put the aim over human values and 
they did not scorn to kill Armenians who might be obstacles on this 
way of achieving this dirty aim. Only in 1890-1892 Khinchak killed 
65000 innocent Turks and Kurds. In 1896 in result of inner-Party 
split  Khinchak’s  activity  weakened  and  its  place  was  taken  by 
another  revolutionary  Party  –  Dashnaktsyutyun.  There  are  lots  of 
facts of black and bloody page of history connected with the same 
Party,  founded  in  1890  in  Tbilisi.  Despite  of  that  the  party  was 
founded  in  Russian  Empire  and  by  Armenians  of  Russia,  the 
manifest of the Party was oriented to “Turkish Armenia”. This Party 
with  socio-directed  political  and  economic  programs  was  behind 
Khinchak neither with its extremist moods nor terrorist’s tactics. Yet 
in  1895  a  well  known  German  journalist  William  Libkhneht  in 
“Forverst”  newspaper  characterized  the  Armenian  movement  as  a 
result  of  activity  of  Armenian  terrorist  organizations  as  he  had 
certain  grounds  for  this.  For  example,  “Mshak”  newspaper, 
published in Tbilisi suggested Muslims to leave the inhabited lands 
for  Arab  deserts.  They  know  Dashnaktsyutsuyn  in  Azerbaijan, 
because  in  the  root  of  politics  of  Armenians  followed  since  last 
century beginning their ideology of Dashnaktsyutsyun and this party. 
www.avciya.az- 91 -
Khojaly genocide: million signatures – one demand
Foreseeing fail in Turkey, in 1904 Dashnaktsyutsyun moved to the 
Caucasus with the aim to widen its activity where they had the prime 
aim to move Azerbaijanis from their historical territories and set up 
Armenian  communities  afterwards  build  Armenian  state  by 
combining  these communities.  There  are  detailed  information  and 
facts  about  it  in  the  books  of  several  European,  Russian  and 
Armenian authors such as: “Description of Azerbaijani Armenians’ 
migration  towards  Russian borders” by Sergey Glinka,  (about  the 
Armenians  living in  Southern Azerbaijan-editor),  “Armenian-Tatar 
massacres in Caucasus as a phase of Armenian issue” by Vladimir 
Mayevskiy, “Turks and Armenians” by Justin and Karolin MacCarts 
and “Notes on migration of Armenians from Iran to our provinces” 
by Alexander Griboyedov.
Throughout  the  history,  gradual  migration  of  Armenians, 
according to Turkmenchay agreement signed on February 10, 1828 
and Adirna agreement in 1929, from Iran and Turkey towards the 
Transcaucasus,  especially  Karabakh  province  of  Azerbaijan  got  a 
wide scope.  Since then,  time to  time removal  and resettlement  of 
Armenians to Azerbaijan territories has been widely interpreted by 
real witnesses of the process, historians and other people. Those who 
moved to Caucasus not only behaved as eternal inhabitants of these 
territories but also strived for building an Armenian state in these 
territories. 
Armenians  have never  avoided  pursuing  a  genocide  policy 
against Azerbaijanis in all the stages of new history. Especially at the 
period of political cataclysms such as 1905-1907 Russian revolution, 
collapse  of  Russian  empire  and  victory  of  socialist  revolution  in 
Russia as well as at the time of high ranking functionaries placed in 
USSR leadership after World War ІІ, at last during the process of 
break-up of Soviet Empire in 1987-1989, Armenians have committed 
an unprecedented savagery against Azerbaijanis. Nowadays there are 
no any Azeri Turks in Western Azerbaijan., whereas looking through 
the  historical  documents,  one  can  be  sure  that  majority  of  the 
www.avciya.az- 92 -
Khojaly genocide: million signatures – one demand
population living in these territories were Azerbaijanis and there are 
a great number of archive materials to prove it.  15 years after the 
celebration  of  the  150th  anniversary  of  Armenians’  removal  to 
Garabagh (Karabakh) in 1973, Armenians decided to set up another 
Armenian state in Upper Garabagh Autonomous Republic  without 
being  satisfied  with  that  they  had  already  built  in  historical 
territories  of  Azerbaijan.  Having  been  displaced  from  Upper 
Garabagh  and  its  adjacent  regions,  nowadays  over  1  million 
Azerbaijanis are living their refugee lives. Armenia, as an aggressive 
state hinders formation of peace and stability in the region, at  the 
same time doesn’t give up its territorial claims against the neighbour 
republics. These are the facts that can not be denied by anyone and 
are known to every Caucasians.  
Bloody tactics, cunning strategy
Still in late 19th century, anti-Turk propagandistic activity of 
“Dashnakustyun” party was going on not only in Iravan and Tbilisi 
but  also  in  Baku.  The  letter  sent  by  Caucasus  viceroyalty  to  the 
governor of Baku read that a 4 scene play by Safrazyan had been 
staged at the theatre named after Tagiyev in Baku, January, 1891. A 
Turk who tortures an Armenian woman is pictured at the 1st scene of 
the spectacle, the woman’s struggle for her liberty at the 2nd scene, 
the same woman murdering the Turk at the 3rd scene and liberated 
Armenia in the example of the woman at the 4th scene.  
Safrazaryan  got  the  name  of  “broker  of  Baku”  from 
Armenians for this play 
At  the  beginning  of  the  19th  century  Armenian  Church 
played a skilful role as the material and moral supporter of Armenian 
nationalist parties.  The law, issued in 1903, regarding the inclusion 
of church’s lands in the disposal of Russian Ministry of Land and 
Property caused ignition of anti-Turk and anti-Moslem spirits among 
www.avciya.az- 93 -
Khojaly genocide: million signatures – one demand
Armenians,  since  it  had  struck  the  financial  condition  of  parties 
funded by the church. Armenian Church masterminded the rebellions 
against that law in Iravan and Echmyadzin. Armenians committed a 
discord  and  terror  acts  in  Ganja,  on  August  29,  in  Shusha  on 
September 29, in Tbilisi on October 14, 1903. Discords spread over 
Russia  and  resentment  against  tsarism  reverberated  across  the 
Transcaucasus. Armenians took an advantage of the chaos skilfully. 
Armenian bands, supplied with arms by high ranking Armenian and 
proArmenian functionaries of the Caucasus viceroyalty, intended to 
achieve  number  superiority  by  conducting  armed  attacks  against 
Azerbaijanis  living  in  Baku,  Iravan,  Nakhichevan,  Zangazur, 
Garabagh, Ganja, Tbilisi and other places and  displacing them from 
there.  Since  Armenians  prevailed  only  in  5  out  of  54  provinces 
existing in the Caucasus at that period. 
A document  of police department  about Armenian-Moslem 
conflicts  in  the  Caucasus  in  1905-1906  reads  “«Dashnaksutyun» 
proved its power, Moslems beared their sufferings. A dual game was 
played here: the first, to wreak vengeance on Moslems partly,  the 
second, to lay the blame on Russian government by means of press 
and  propaganda.  As  a  result  many  Russian  officials  and  other 
persons disliked by Armenians became the victims of terror. General 
Alikhanov-Avarsky,  Nakashidze-governor  of  Baku,  Andreyev-vice 
governor of Ganja, colonel Bikov and Sakharov were among those 
victims. The second and partially achieved goal of Armenians was 
that  the  territories  inhabited  by  Armenians  and  Moslems  in  the 
Transcaucasus were separated from each other. Lands were deserted 
for resettlement of Armenians removed from Turkey and Iran.” 
Murder of one Azerbaijani by Armenians indeed was not a 
coincidence  as  several  authors  claimed,  but  a  planned  incident 
happening time to time in the cities crowded by all rich Armenians 
of the Caucasus. Armenians were certain to achieve all they wanted, 
oil resources of Baku with the help of Armenian millionaires living 
in Baku and later to drive the Moslems out of the Transcaucasus by

force then  to  set  up an  Armenian  state.  Although about  thousand 
people died at the massacres, happened on the 6-10th of February 
from both sides, but Armenians’ intentions didn’t come up and they 
were defeated. 
Armenians committed massacres in Iravan on February 21-
23, as well. The situation escalated again after three Azerbaijanis got 
severe injury in Jahry village of Nakhichevan province on May 5, 
1905 and murder of one in Tunbul village on May 7. Baranovsky, 
the  vice  governor  of  Iravan  along  with  Aghamolov,  the  chief  of 
Iravan  city  and  chief  of  Nakhichevan  city,  Jafargulu  khan 
Nakhichevansky came to Nakhichevan on May 8. As the massacres 
are still running, general Alikhanov-Avarsky was sent to Nkhichevan 
as  well.  The  massacres  were  instigated  again  after  Armenians’ 
attacks  against  Azerbaijanis  from  Garsachay  garden.  Then 
Armenians  attacked  on  neighbouring  Azerbaijani  villages.  The 
results  matched  very  well  with  Armenians’  intentions:  If 
Azerbaijanis made up 313176 of all the population living in Iravan 
province  in  1897,  this  figure  was  302965  in  1907.  10  thousand 
Azerbaijanis were executed in the province within 1897-1906. 
Having achieved their objects, Armenians started committing 
massacres in Garabagh.  Veysally, Gajar, Chamanly, Arish, Gishlag 
and  Marza  villages  of  Jabrayil-Garyagyn  province  were  entirely 
devastated as a result of Armenians’ attacks which have started since 
July 1. Massacres were committed in Shusha on August 19 as well. 
Armenians  caused  disorders  and  slew  thousands  of  innocent 
Azerbaijanis in Ganja and Tbilisi cities as well as in Javanshyr and 
Gazakh  provinces  in  November,  1905.  According  to  Armenian 
author S.Zavaryan, there were 12 Moslem villages in Shusha, 15 in 
Javanshyr, 5 in Jabrayil and 43 in Zangazur provinces. By sending 
letters to Armenians living in Abaran, Alexanderepol and Shorayel, 
Armenian organizations assembled soldiers in order to build a road 
from  Garabagh  to  Zangazur  in  summer,  1906.  The  number  of 
Armenians was little enough along the way leading from Iravan to 
www.avciya.az- 95 -
Khojaly genocide: million signatures – one demand
Zangazur  as  well  as  from  Zangazur  to  Garabagh.  Therefore 
Armenian soldiers were commanded to attack Azerbaijani villages, 
situated  along  the  way  and  raze  them  to  the  ground.  Over  20 
Azerbaijani villages in Zangazur province were razed to the ground 
by  Armenians  only  in  August,  1906.  Generally,  over  200 
Azerbaijani villages in Iravan and Ganja provinces were destroyed 
and their populations became the victims of genocide within 1905-
1906.  But  there  were  disastrous  terrors  and  tragedies  against 
Azerbaijanis ahead.
A new stage of “purge”
As  we  mentioned  above,  Armenians  tried  to  realize  their 
ambitions at the time of historical cataclysms and political disorders. 
During  the  political  chaos  in  Russia,  1917,  Armenian  dashnaks 
worked out a plan to entirely annihilate Azerbaijanis living not only 
in their historical territories, Northern Azerbaijan, but also in other 
areas of the Caucasus. Their main goal was to commit a genocide act 
against Azerbaijanis and wipe them out completely. According to the 
plan,  Armenians  committed  genocide  against  local  population  in 
Baku, Shamakhy,  Guba and Goychay.  A veteran teacher and real 
witness  of  horrors  of  those  days,  Mammad  Huseyin  Akhundov 
remembers  that  period  so:  “Armenians  reached  Goychay  slaying 
Azerbaijanis. They committed unprecedented terrors, cleaved uteri of 
pregnant women and drove the babies into walls by thrusting them 
onto the spears, gathered people in the mosques and set fire on them, 
attached hot samovars on girls’ and women’s backs and made other 
horrors.”
After the collapse of Tsar Government in Russia, Armenian 
soldiers  and  armed  groups,  served  at  the  Russian  Army in  battle 
fields  of  Germany  and  Austria  assembled  in  Baku  to  realize 
dashnaks’ ambitions. 
www.avciya.az- 96 -

The end of March, 1918 became bloody and tragic days for 
Azerbaijani  people in  the history.  The massacre  lasted for 3 days 
since March 31. During these pogroms, Armenian armed groups with 
the help of Bolsheviks  unexpectedly attacked Azerbaijani  districts 
and killed elders and kids without exception. A German, with Kulner 
surname who had witnessed those horrific days wrote in 1925 about 
the pogroms committed by Armenians in Baku: Armenians plunged 
into  Moslem  (Azerbaijani-editor)  districts,  murdered  everyone, 
tearing with sword and piercing holes on them with bayonet. Several 
days after the pogrom, the corpses of 87 Azerbaijanis were taken out 
of a hollow and Armenians cut their ears, noses and tore stomachs 
and chopped sex organs. Armenians didn’t have mercy on the elder 
as they didn’t have on kids.” 57 Azerbaijanis were found with ears, 
noses cut and stomachs torn only in one district of Baku after the 
March pogroms. Nailing up of young women alive on the walls and 
burning of city hospital hosted by 2 thousand people whom tried to 
protect themselves from Armenians’ attacks are among horrific facts. 
Death toll was about 15 thousand. After the mass-scale pogroms of 
Azerbaijanis,  Stepan Shaumyan,  the head of  The Baku Commune 
worked out his plan, which led to the massacres in Guba, Shamakhy, 
Salyan and Goychay regions to annihilate Azerbaijanis as a nation.
Armenian  bandits  had  already  committed  massacres  in 
Shamakhy  early  in  1918.  The  massacres  had  been  conducted 
continuously in a planned way since March. As a result of sudden 
onslaught  of Armenian armed detachments,  250 men,  150 women 
and  135  children  have  been  murdered  in  Gubaly  village  of 
Shamakhy  uyezd  (district).  The  carnage  of  infants  is  an 
unprecedented  barbarism in  world  history.  Armenian  detachments 
murdered 40 men, 50 women and 30 children in Garavally village 
where  there  were just  66 houses.  Armenians  shut  up women and 
children at their homes and burned. They murdered 192 men, 115 
women and 25 children in Gushchu village. Such kinds of massacres 
were  committed  in  all  the  settlements  inhabited  by  Azerbaijanis. 
www.avciya.az- 97 -

Armenians  used  cunning  before  attacking  Shamakhy;  they  sent 
bishop to Shamakhy on March 16 and persuaded people that they 
wouldn’t touch anyone. But then it turned up that Armenians lied in 
order to slay majority of the population. The massacres committed 
by Armenians in Shamakhy are the blackest, bloodiest and the most 
horrible  scenes  not  only  in  Azerbaijan  history  but  also  human 
history. The witnesses of those scenes are still alive and they even 
now, albeit  many years passed since that time, cannot help crying 
when they remember those dreadful days………and such kinds of 
facts will not let the witnesses’ tears dry: about 8 thousand civilians 
were  murdered  in  Shamakhy  in  March-April,  1918.  When 
Bolsheviks seized Baku city and province in April, 1918, by Stepan 
Shaumyann’s instructions measures were taken to seize the power in 
Guba province. 
On May 1,  a  great  military  detachment  consisting  of  only 
Armenians surrounded Guba, under the command of dashnak officer 
Hamzasp  and opened fire  on the  city  with artillery and machine-
guns.  Hamzasp’s  detachment  was  not  an  ordinary.  It  contained 
military units which consisted of Armenians who assembled under 
the special  name “punishment detachment” and notorious for their 
savagery. Hamzasp with his detachment was sent to Guba personally 
by Stepan Shaumyan. He had not consulted other commissars about 
it.  Military  commissar  Grigory  Korganov  established  the 
detachment. He involved by Stepan Shaumyan’s request 2 thousand 
soldiers  in  Hamzasp’s  detachment  who  were  members  of 
“Dashnaksutyun”  party.  Having occupied  Guba,  Hamzasp  sent  an 
appeal letter to city population with full of threats. The appeal read “I 
am a hero of Armenian people and protector of its interests. I have 
sent here-to Guba in order to take Armenians’ revenge upon you. I 
have got an instruction to annihilate all the Moslems living from the 
Caspian coast to Shahdagh Mountain. I have been charged to raze 
your  hearth  and  home  to  the  ground,  to  do  what  we  have  done 
www.avciya.az- 98 -
Khojaly genocide: million signatures – one demand
against  you  in Shamakhy and to  take our  brothers’  revenge upon 
you.”
Armenians squeezed into the houses in Guba and neighbour 
villages and sometimes killed the whole family members without any 
mercy  towards  children  and  pregnant  women.  For  instance,  they 
decapitated whole 14 and 5 family members of Karbalayi Taji oglu 
(son)  and  Mahammad  Rasul  oglu,  respectively,  burned  Haji 
Dadashbala Gasum oglu’s wife Bibikhanum and son Abdul Gasum 
alive, chopped Abuzar Mastan oglu and his two daughters, Hokuma 
and Bustan with babies in their arms into pieces and cut Mashady 
Gambar Molla  Muhammed Saleh oglu together  with his  wife and 
five kids into two equal parts. Almost all the elders in Guba were 
murdered.  Along  with  all  kinds  of  brutality  and  plundering, 
Armenians  even  didn’t  avoid  committing  rascal  and  villain  acts. 
Armenians ordered respectable persons of the city to bring Moslem 
women and girls in order to amuse themselves. Alipasha Karbalayi 
Maharram oglu together with his son, who absolutely rejected that 
were shot down immediately. Sometimes Armenians took out men’s 
eyes and slashed down women who were disobedient to their orders. 
Hamzasp’s  detachment  set  fire  to  105  houses  only  in  Guba. 
Generally,  Armenian  dashnaks  devastated  122  villages  of  Guba 
province by burning them. 
During pogroms of 1918, Armenians were not able to achieve 
their ambition-to liquidate Azerbaijanis as a nation. But Azerbaijanis 
became victims  of  real  genocide.  It  is  difficult  to  tell  how many 
Azerbaijanis were murdered in those massacres. Since many archives 
were destroyed by Armenians later. But facts and archive documents 
that are available today enable us to imagine disasters of that period. 
Thus, 229 settlements in Baku province, as well as 58 in Shamakhy, 
112  in  Guba,  372  in  Ganja,  including  115  in  Zangazur,  157  in 
Garabagh,  211  in  Iravan,  82  in  Gars  provinces  were  completely 
devastated;  tens of thousands of people were killed and displaced 
from their historical  territories. In May, 1918, Armenian state was 
www.avciya.az- 99 -
Khojaly genocide: million signatures – one demand
established  in  Iravan  province,  which  was  historical  territory  of 
Azerbaijan.  Armed  bands of  Andronik committed  carnage  against 
Azerbaijanis at that time. They murdered thousands of Azerbaijanis 
savagely  in  Goycha,  Nakhichevan,  Zangazur,  Gorus  and  Shusha. 
Armenian  author,  Z.Korkodyan in  his  book “population  of  Soviet 
Armenia” wrote that as a result,  during the collapse of Azerbaijan 
Democratic Republic there were only 10 thousand people out of 575 
thousand Azerbaijanis living in the territory of present day Armenia 
till  1920.  So,  half  a  million  Azerbaijanis  undergone  genocide  in 
Armenia in 1918-1920 took refugee in Azerbaijan. The government 
of Soviet Azerbaijan inherited problem of repatriation of refugees to 
their  eternal  territories  from Azerbaijan Democratic  Republic.  But 
the problem didn’t  find its  solution even at  the Soviet  time.  Only 
about  100  thousand  Azerbaijanis  could  return  to  their  historical 
territories till 1922.
“Contemporary” forms of repression
Gradual deportation of Azerbaijanis from Western Azerbaijan 
in  the  following years,  at  least  their  total  banishment  from those 
territories against a background of Garabagh issue broke out in 1987 
that turned Armenia into monoethnic state. 
Generally,  there  are  no  instances  of  the  history  in  which 
Armenians have not used any inhumane means against Azerbaijanis. 
743573 Armenians and 84717 Azerbaijanis were registered so far in 
Armenia, in 1926 and 1062000 Armenians, 130800 Azerbaijanis in 
1939, respectively. Armenians increased by 42,7 and Azerbaijanis by 
56,8 percent, respectively in comparison. Armenians were naturally 
concerned about this increase rate.
And  how  were  the  repressions  committed  against 
Azerbaijanis?  Naturally  there  were  no  traces  left  about  it  in 
Armenian  press  at  that  time.  But  the  information,  given  by 
www.avciya.az- 100 -
Khojaly genocide: million signatures – one demand
immigrants who were lucky to be able to flee from repressions to 
Iran and Turkey was given in several magazines published in Turkey 
and Germany. Late in 1920s and early in 30s, the strictest measures 
of collectivization realized across the Soviet Union were used against 
Azerbaijanis  living in  Armenia.  First  of  all,  they dispossessed the 
rich  ones  of  the  cattle  which  they  inherited  from  ancestors  and 
included  in  the  economy  of  kolkhoz  and  dubbing  them  as 
“golchomag”  (kulak)  afterwards  exiled  them  to  Kazakhstan  and 
Siberia. Thereafter, the use of such kinds of acts against the middle 
peasants  and  dispossessing  them  of  cattle  along  with  sowing 
plantations  caused  peasant  revolts  in  Vedibasar,  Zangybasar  and 
Gamarly. 
After revolts of villages were suppressed, most of the rebels 
were obliged to flee to Iran and Turkey thereafter mass arrests were 
launched in Azerbaijani villages under the pretext of the revolt. The 
relationship ties of Turks and Azerbaijanis living in Armenia with 
Iran and Turkey as well as their alleged connections with counter-
revolutionary forces immigrated to those countries were the second 
pretext for the launch of mass arrests. 
Mass repressions against Azerbaijanis obliged them to flee to 
Turkey. This was happening especially in neighbouring villages with 
Turkey on a  mass  scale.  Azerbaijanis  living in Armenia  at  nights 
with  groups  crossed  through  weakly  guarded  border  points  and 
mountainous  areas  to  Turkey.  Over  fifty  thousand  Turks  of 
Vedibasar,  Zangybasar,  Gamarly,  Daralayaz,  Aghababa  and  other 
regions  were  exiled  to  Kazakhstan  desserts  together  with  their 
families. Most of the people died due to severe climatic and ruined 
apartment conditions. 
After the exile term expired,  the families decided to return 
their  homes  but  Armenians  didn’t  allow them excusing  that  their 
region is close to Turkey’s border therefore families either went back 
or took refuge in Azerbaijan and Georgia. At present, majority of our 
compatriots living in Kazakhstan are descendants of families exiled 
www.avciya.az- 101 -
Khojaly genocide: million signatures – one demand
from Armenia in 1930s. Azerbaijanis got much heavier blow in the 
background of intensified repressions in Armenia, autumn, 1937. A. 
Mikoyan,  N.Yezhov  and  L.Beriya  came  to  Armenia  to  unmask 
people’s  enemies,  trotskichibuxarinist  spies.  During  the  “purging” 
process  led  by  Mikoyan,  Moscow  was  informed  that  as  if 
Azerbaijanis living in Araz and Yukhary (Upper) Arpachay regions 
of Armenia intended to cross to Turkey all together. Therefore, ten 
thousands  of  Azerbaijanis  living  in  villages  of  Vedibasar, 
Zangybasar,  Gamarly,  Echmiadzin,  Hoktemberyan  and  Aghbaba 
regions which were adjacent to Turkish borders, were repressed and 
thousands of families were exiled on a mass scale in autumn of that 
year and summer, 1938. 
Generally, over 50 thousand Azerbaijanis were repressed in 
1930s.  Having met with no any resistance during the execution of 
these  repressions,  Armenian  leadership  achieved  realization  of 
another action-deportation of Azerbaijanis-in late 40s and early 50s.  
 
Deportations in 1948-1953
In  spite  of  the  fact  of  genocide  committed  against 
Azerbaijanis  in  Armenia,  in  1918-1920  and  repressions  in  1930-
1938, Azerbaijanis still prevailed along borderlines of Armenia with 
Turkey and Iran, including Azerbaijan and Georgia.  Neighbouring 
regions of Iravan city were considered the most fertile soil and the 
majority of the population was Azerbaijanis in these regions. 
The basic goal of the Armenian leadership was to displace 
Azerbaijanis from those fertile lands in outskirts of Iravan and along 
Turkish borders.  
First of all, Moscow should approve that. It was necessary to 
inform Iosif Stalin about that the Armenians living abroad wish to 
live in Armenia  and shortage of territories  to accommodate  them. 
They considered the only way out was to move Turks to low-lying 
www.avciya.az- 102 -
Khojaly genocide: million signatures – one demand
regions of Azerbaijan. They didn’t miss the opportunity to raise the 
issue to move Armenians living abroad to Armenia first time during 
Tehran  conference  in  1943.  During  the  move  of  the  conference, 
representatives of Armenian Diaspora got into contact with Molotov, 
the  foreign  minister  of  USSR  and  requested  him  that  Soviet 
leadership  approve  their  removal  to  Armenia.  Having  talked  to 
Stalin, Molotov noted that they approved it. 
Q.Harutyunov,  the  secretary  general  of  CC  (Central 
Committee) of Communist Party (CP) again raised the question of 
merging Garabagh with Armenia.  He noted that if the matter  was 
solved  positively  he  would  work  out  proposals  regarding  the 
restoration  of  Shusha,  the  former  center  of  Garabagh  which  was 
ruined in 1920 and submit them to the Central Government. Stalin 
sent  the  letter  to  G.Malenkov  and he  in  his  turn  forwarded  it  to 
Mirjafar  Baghirov,  the  head  of  Azerbaijan  Communist  Party. 
M.Baghirov replied that he didn’t object, provided that territories of 
Armenia,  Georgia  and  Dagestan  which  were  settled  mainly  by 
Azerbaijanis  and  historical  Azerbaijan  territories  should  be  given 
back.  Thus,  feeling  that  the  event  was  going  in  an  undesirable 
direction,  Moscow had to pass it  over.  Armenian leaders  changed 
their  tactics  thereafter.  They  tried  to  achieve  deportations  of 
Azerbaijanis living in Armenia under the pretext of accommodation 
of Armenians, to be brought from abroad. 
Having grounded upon the petition by Armenian government, 
USSR  government  passed  a  resolution  on  the  organization  of 
removal  Armenians  living  abroad  to  Soviet  Armenia.  A  special 
committee  on  reception  and  accommodation  of  Armenians  was 
established  within  Armenian  government  and  the  government 
dispatched  its  representatives  to  those  countries  from  which 
Armenians were to be removed.  30000 Armenians expressed their 
wishes to move to Armenia at the beginning of 1946. “Hynchak” and 
“Ramkavar”  parties  as  well  as Armenia-wide Philanthropic  Union 
spent 1 million dollars on the organization of the removal. 
www.avciya.az- 103 -
Khojaly genocide: million signatures – one demand
Armenian  leaders  elucidate  the  reason  of  decrease  in 
removing process as that the Armenians coming from abroad were 
mainly city  residents  therefore  it  was  impossible  to  accommodate 
them in upland areas as well as those who had removed wanted to 
settle down only in Iravan and near-by regions. Armenian leadership 
deliberately kept Armenians coming from abroad at railway stations 
for days and propagandized among them that if they were not likely 
to be accommodated in Iravan and near-by regions, they should send 
a  telegram  to  Soviet  government  about  going  back-abroad.  They 
specially  emphasized  I.  Stalin’s  attention  that  these  cases  would 
discredit the Soviet  government in foreign countries.  On the other 
hand, the list of Armenians longing to move to Armenia from abroad 
was submitted to Moscow.  
Q. Harutyunov, the secretary general of Central Committee of 
Armenian  Communist  Party  considered  removal  of  hundred 
thousands of population from Armenia to Azerbaijan as “the only 
way out of the situation” and asked I. Stalin to approve it. Armenian 
government had prepared the list of settlements, to host Armenians 
in  advance.  Firstly,  Iravan city and near-by Ashtarak,  Zangibasar, 
Echmiadzin,  Hoktemberyan,  Artashat,  (Gamatly),  Garabaghlar, 
Vedi,  Yeghegnadzor,  Hrazdan  (Akhta),  Azizbayov  etc,  were 
included in the list. 
Armenian  leaders  were  able  to  persuade  Stalin  that  it  was 
economically  profitable  to  accommodate  Azerbaijanis  displaced 
from Armenia to cotton growing regions of Azerbaijan in Mughan-
Mill Plain. Since Council of Ministers of USSR enacted a resolution 
on reconstruction of Kur-Araz Plain in 1945. 
12306 families (54373 people) were displaced from Armenia 
in  1949.  While  Council  of  Ministers  of  Azerbaijan  SSR  made  a 
decision to displace 2419 families  (14361 people) in 1950, 65000 
people were displaced that year. It was possible to supply only 4878 
of  families  displaced  from  Armenia  in  1948-1950  with  dwelling 
houses.  Some  of  the  population  displaced  early  in  1951,  were 
www.avciya.az- 104 -
Khojaly genocide: million signatures – one demand
obliged  to  go  back-  to  deserted  villages.  Being  cautioned  that 
repatriation would take a mass scale Armenian leadership refused to 
accept  them.  In fact,  villages  were mainly left  deserted  under  the 
pretext of accommodation of Armenians from abroad. Few of them 
went to villages. Majority of the Armenians felt themselves deceived 
and  didn’t  want  to  live  in  socially  ruined  Azerbaijani  villages. 
Armenians strived for going back to those countries they had come 
from.
It  was planned to displace  1500 families  from Armenia  to 
Kur-Araz  Plain  in  1951.  400 families  were  to  be  displaced  from 
Iravan.  According  to  the  resolution  of  Council  of  Ministers  of 
Azerbaijan SSR on displacement plan which was enacted in 1952, it 
was  intended  to  move  1200  economies  and  this  plan  was 
implemented for 124,6 % at the end of the year. At the same time, 
over thousand families moved from Armenia to Azerbaijan illegally. 
If  about  150  people  were  not  displaced  by  Armenians  in 
1948-1953,  along  with  this  deportation  cultural  and  educational 
institutions were not shut down and leading cadres were not ousted, 
the number of Azerbaijanis living in Armenia would be equal to that 
of  Armenians  as  a  result  of  natural  increase  of  Azerbaijani 
population in late 80s.  Armenian leadership anticipated this danger 
and took timely measures. 
Although in 1989, SSR government made a resolution on the 
resumption  of  rights  of  nations,  undergone  deportations  in  40s; 
Azerbaijanis who had displaced from Armenia in 1948-1953 were 
not included in the list.
 “Propagandistic stage” of the deportation
Although  Armenians’  policy  and  assaults  against 
Azerbaijanis were slackened after 1948-1953 deportations, especially 
Stalin’s  death,  but  anti-Turk  and  anti-Azerbaijan  propaganda  was 
www.avciya.az- 105 -
Khojaly genocide: million signatures – one demand
still  going  on.  Even  official  circles  of  Armenia  by  Moscow’s 
approval  enacted  a  resolution  regarding  the  celebration  of  50th 
anniversary of false “Armenian genocide”. Armenia’s all mass media 
propagandized  the  “genocide”  which  was  allegedly  took  place  in 
1915  all  year  long.  Taking  an  advantage  of  the  opportunity, 
“Dashnaksutyun” party which had been functioning secretly started 
functioning  publicly.  In  February,  1969  Armenian  nationalists 
celebrated solemnly the 100th anniversary of birthday of Andranik 
Ozanyan who had played a core role in the massacres of Turks and 
Azerbaijanis.  Reunion  Committee  of  Armenia  was  set  up  at  that 
time.  The  basic  goal  of  the  Committee  was  to  join  “Turkish 
Armenia”,  Nakhichevan  and  Garabagh  to  present  Armenia.  As  a 
result of discrimination policy of Armenia in the mid 60s, thousands 
of Azerbaijanis were urged to move from Iravan and neighbouring 
villages. 
SSR government made a decision to receive new groups of 
Armenians living abroad in 1961. 26 thousand of Armenians moved 
from abroad to Armenia in 1961-1973. Removal of Armenians from 
abroad resulted in deportations of Azerbaijanis in 60s as it  was in 
1946-1948 and caused the move of tens of thousand Azerbaijanis to 
Azerbaijan and other places. 
According to All-Union census in 1979, there were 160841 
people in Armenia which comprised 5,3 % of Armenian population. 
But  irony  of  the  history  was  different:  Armenian  Republic  was 
awarded  with  “Friendship  of  Nations”  order.  On  April  24,  1983, 
Armenians  under  the  pretext  of  “genocide”  made  attacks  on  the 
villages  which  were  situated  in  the  center  of  Masis  region-  in 
Ulukhanly settled by Azerbaijanis as well as destroyed cemetery of a 
settlement.  Defenceless  people  were  obliged  to  take  shelter  in 
Turkish borders. National discrimination escalated into so breaking 
point that even Central Committee (CC) of Soviet Union Communist 
Party  (SUCP) which  had indulged Azerbaijanis’  deportation  for  a 
long time was obliged to react to these matters.

“Implementation of resolutions of SUCP CC’s plenary session dated

economic structures.

instigated hostile feelings against Azerbaijanis in Armenia.  At that 
time there were 170 pure and 94 mixed Azerbaijani settlements in 
Armenia. 
Heydar Aliyev, who was the main obstacle for Armenians to 
realize their territorial claims against Azerbaijan, was deprived of his 
membership  at  Political  Bureau  of  SUCP CC and post  of  deputy 
general  of chairman of  USSR Council  of  Ministers  as a result  of 
pressure by Armenian lobby in October, 1987. At the end of October 
of the same year, protests were launched in Iravan with the claim of 
merging  Garabagh  with  Armenia.  But  on  November  18,  Mikhail 
Gobachov’s counsellor on economical affairs, Abel Aganbekyan in 
his speech before Armenian community in Paris stated that USSR 
leadership  considered  it  feasible  to  merge  Upper  Garabagh  to 
Armenia  and  useful  for  economical  development  of  the  region. 
“Humanite”  newspaper  of  French  communists  disseminated  the 
news. Aganbekyan was naturally permitted by USSR leadership to 
make  such  a  statement.  Influence  of  Armenian  lobby  on  Soviet 
leadership had increased at that time. Mikhail Gorbachev’s assistant 
A.  Shahnazaryan  was  Garabagh  Armenian  by  origin.  Armenian 
Diaspora  abroad  spent  great  financial  allocations  for  this  work. 
Heydar Aliyev’s dismissal from USSR leadership gave them much 
more opportunities. Nevertheless, Armenians several times tried to 
raise the question regarding both Upper Garabagh and Nakichevan 
during Heydar Aliyev’s tenure both at the leadership of Azerbaijan 
Republic  in  1969-1983  and  representation  at  USSR leadership  in 
www.avciya.az- 107 -
Khojaly genocide: million signatures – one demand
1983-1987,  but  they  couldn’t  achieve  their  goals.  A.  Kochinyan, 
former  secretary  general  of  Central  Committee  of  Armenian 
Communist  Party  wrote  that  during  his  tenure  at  Armenian 
leadership,  Garabagh  issue  was  raised  several  times  but  Heydar 
Aliyev’s ascendancy and power in central circles didn’t enable not 
only solution of the question but also its discussion. 
Another incident happened in 1976. Former secretary general 
of Party Committee of Gubadly,  Masuda Rustamova writes in her 
reminiscences: “Previously, zonal conferences were often held. One 
of  these  conferences  was  to  be  held  in  Khankandy.  Although 
Republic  leadership,  party  and  soviet  leaders  of  the  regions  and 
heads  of  economies  came  to  Khankandy  to  participate  at  the 
conference  but  Armenians  blocked  their  way  in  Askaran  near 
Khankandy and didn’t allow them to enter the region. They wouldn’t 
stand out of the way unless Heydar Aliyev came. Finally,  Heydar 
Aliyev  came  and  learned  from  Krasilnikov,  the  chair  of  State 
Security Committee what the matter was, thereafter he himself went 
forward. He gave question to the Armenians who had been blocking 
the  way:  “What’s  matter,  what’s  happened,  what  you  want? 
Armenians answered unanimously “give us a territory then we will 
go.” Glaring at them Heydar Aliyev said “I have no objection you 
may  go.  The  road  is  open  to  Dagestan,  Georgia  and  Armenia.  I 
would do all my best to help you. If you want I can send you by sea, 
air and train. We will do how you want.” Then he raised his voice for 
everyone to hear: “My lands remained there, in Armenia, too. We are 
not going to give anyone an inch of land.” 
We  should  note  that  Abel  Aganbekyan  based  on  false 
arguments  while  saying  “economical  development  of  the  region”. 
The real fact was that Upper Garabagh was foremost region in the 
Transcaucasus  for  its  economical  development.  His  statement  in 
Paris soon sparked the start of many tragedies. Extraordinary session 
of People’s Deputies Soviet of Upper Garabagh Autonomous Region 
(SPD UGAR) held with the participation of only Armenian deputies 
www.avciya.az- 108 -
Khojaly genocide: million signatures – one demand
enacted a resolution on detachment of the Autonomous Region from 
Azerbaijan  and  annexation  of  it  into  administrative  territorial 
division of Armenia. After the rejection of SPD UGAR’s resolution 
by Supreme Soviet of Azerbaijan SSR, Armenian nationalist leaders 
started  realizing  “Armenia  without  Turks”  policy  of 
“Dashnaksutyun”  party.  The  last  genocide  and  deportation  policy 
was launched against Azerbaijanis in Armenia. Meetings had been 
held under the slogans “Armenia is only for Armenians” and “To 
purge Turks from Armenia” in Iravan since February, 19, 1988. Only 
mosque, remained intact in Iravan was burned on the third day of the 
meetings. Nevertheless, there were 8 mosques in Iravan, at the start 
of the 20th century.  Inventories of an Azerbaijani secondary school 
and Azerbaijan Dram Theatre were destroyed. Armenians burned the 
houses  of  Azerbaijanis  who  were  protesting  against  it  in  Iravan. 
Sumgayit pogroms were being prepared during these events. Eduard 
Grigoryan was one of the activists in the realization of “Sumgayit 
pogroms”  plan  (He  killed  6  of  26  Armenians  murdered-  editor). 
Armenians  withdrew  all  their  deposits  from  saving-banks  of 
Sumgayit city just 10 days before the incident. Armenian operators 
took their positions beforehand where the pogroms were planned to 
be committed and just two days after the incident they made cutting 
and  paste  work  on  the  videotape  then  deceived  the  entire  world. 
They  also  installed  immediately  a  ready  made  monument  to 
perpetuate  the  memory of  “Sumgayit  victims”  in  Khankandy.  All 
these  facts  mentioned  above  proves  that  they  wanted  to  instigate 
Armenians as well as world community against Azerbaijani nation 
and form “savage” image  of  Azerbaijan.  The names  of  Ohanyan, 
Samoylov and Pavlovskiy, the organizers of Sumgayit pogroms were 
concealed from press and community for a long time.  We should 
remind  that  Armenians  made  use  of  their  evil  experience  during 
these events. Early in 20th century Armenian nationalists even didn’t 
avoid  killing  Armenians  in  order  to  incite  Armenians  living  in 
Turkey  and  putting  blame  on  Turks.  There  are  hundreds  of 
www.avciya.az- 109 -
Khojaly genocide: million signatures – one demand
undeniable facts in archives to prove it. Afterwards ex-president of 
Armenia,  Levon  Terpetrosyan  in  his  interview  said:  “Azerbaijani 
people were shocked after Sumgayit events. If USSR leadership had 
made a decision about the annexation of UGAR to Armenia without 
missing  the  opportunity,  Azerbaijani  people  would  not  have  been 
able to protest it.”
It is necessary to stress one fact that Moscow’s stance in this 
matter played a key role in the escalation of the events. For instance, 
at that  time, secretaries of CC SUCP, Yuri Ligachov in Baku and 
Alexander Yakovlev in Iravan were making different statements, the 
one emphasized  that  Upper  Garabagh was a historical  territory of 
Azerbaijan, the another was talking about the existence of political 
possibilities  to  annex  the  Region  to  Armenia.  Moscow  took  this 
stance also during 1905-1907 and 1918-1920 massacres.
In early years of new stage of massacres and deportations, the 
displacement  of  more  that  200  thousand  Azerbaijanis  living  in 
Armenia was as vital as the solution of Garabagh issue. The problem 
was so aggravated that even Armenians living in Bogdanovka and 
Akhylkalak regions of Georgia made armed attacks on Azerbaijani 
villages of Armenia. Even though Moscow was to dispatch troops of 
internal  affairs  to  the  regions  settled  mainly  by  Azerbaijanis,  the 
current of events showed that these divisions were authorized just to 
observe the massacres. 
Session  of  Supreme  Soviet  of  Armenia  SSR  enacted  a 
resolution on the annexation of UGAR to Armenia on July, 15 1988 
and appeal to USSR Supreme Soviet to approve it.  After Supreme 
Soviet  of  Azerbaijan  SSR  rejected  the  demand  on  July,  17,  the 
condition of Azerbaijanis in Armenia aggravated. In fact, in Armenia 
it was clear that Supreme Soviet of Azerbaijan SSR would reject it. 
But they were confident that they would stir up Armenians by this 
way  and  they  achieved  their  goals.  Now  on  July  17-20,  furious 
Armenian groups poured into the busses and attacked Masi region 
and  its  villages  settled  by  Azerbaijanis.  Over  10  thousand 
www.avciya.az- 110 -
Khojaly genocide: million signatures – one demand
defenceless Azerbaijanis gathered at USSR and Turkish border and 
had to spend the night there. Over 20 Azerbaijanis were injured and 
3 thousand were evicted from their houses on these days. 
Meeting  of  Presidium of  USSR Supreme  Soviet  discussed 
UGAR’s issue and considered it inadmissible to change the borders 
between  republics  and  afterwards  Armenian  nationalists  started 
organizing  meetings  to  displace  Azerbaijanis  from  Armenia. 
Associate member of the Academy of Science of Armenia,  Rafael 
Kazaryan told at the meeting held in Iravan on November 4, 1988; 
“It is necessary to organize the emigration with the help of groups. 
We have a chance to purge Armenia from Azerbaijanis for the first 
time since decades. I consider it the greatest achievement of our ten 
months’  struggle.”  In  mid  of  November  1988,  over  80  thousand 
Azerbaijanis  escaped  from the  massacres  and  fled  to  Azerbaijan. 
Then  horrible  events  were  happening  in  Armenia.  For  example, 
Armenians attacked Vartanly village inhabited by Azerbaijanis and 
Armenians at night of November 25-26, in 1988. In spite of snow-
storm,  Azerbaijanis  left  the  village  and fled  to  forest.  Armenians 
roped Meharly Iskandarov to a tree and before his eyes, pulled a rope 
over his wife, Khanym Iskandarova’s head and insulting her dragged 
throughout the village. Being aware of this, Alim their 14 aged son, 
came down from the forest with a shot-gun in his hand and ought to 
open fire to rescue his parents. Armenians also opened fire at him. 
Then  they  take  wounded  boy and  threw him into  fire  before  his 
parents.  Because  of  savagery  committed  against  her  son,  mother 
threw herself into a river. But Armenians pulled her out of the river 
and murdered with torture. Being wildly beaten, Mehraly Iskandarov 
died. Having heard about his fellow-villager’s tragedy 69 years old 
Garib Bayramov who had lost  his  arm at war in  1941-1945 went 
there to take their corpses but at that time Armenians struck him with 
an axe and threw into the fire. An old woman of the village, Leyla 
Huseynova  died  of  the  axe  blow  that  she  had  got  on  her  head. 
Suleyman  Mammadov  hid  himself  at  his  Armenian  neighbour’s 
www.avciya.az- 111 -
Khojaly genocide: million signatures – one demand
home but the neighbour betrayed him to Armenians and they burned 
automobile  tyres  then  threw Suleyman  Mammadov  alive  into  the 
fire. At the same night 14 Azerbaijanis were savagely killed and then 
burned  in  Vartanly  village.  13  Vartanly  dwellers  were  lost  at 
mountains  while  escaping.  Generally,  more  than  30  Azerbaijanis 
were murdered in Gugark region where Vartanly village is situated. 
There are hundreds of such facts and such kinds of massacres were 
committed  in  all  the  regions  of  Armenia.  Only  in  1988,  213 
Azerbaijanis were killed in Armenia most of them were children and 
old men. 2 of those murdered were decapitated, 11-burned alive, 3-
cut into pieces and 29-crushed under the wheels of a car. Armenian’s 
unlimited malice and cunning against Azerbaijanis turned up again 
during terrible  earthquake  in  Armenia,  on December  7,  1988.  An 
incident  was happened which didn’t  have analogue in the history: 
Armenians  shot  Azerbaijani  aircraft  which  was  carrying 
humanitarian  and  live  aid  for  Armenians  suffered  from  the 
earthquake. Only 1 out of 77 passengers of the aircraft, F.Balayev a 
Bakuvian automobile smith survived. Armenians even didn’t allow 
taking  him  to  hospitals  in  Armenia.  170  pure  and  94  mixed 
settlements  which  were  inhabited  by  Azerbaijanis  were  deserted 
within 1988-1989. The last  Azerbaijani  village,  Nuvady in Mehry 
region of Armenia was deserted in August, 1991. Over 200 thousand 
Azerbaijanis were driven out of their historical lands. A historian of 
Armenia,  Silva  Kaputikyan’s  recommendation,  “It  is  necessary  to 
overwhelm Turks always especially its Azerbaijani branch. Struggle 
against every Azerbaijani must be conducted at State level.” came to 
reality. Once having succeeded in establishing a state in the historical 
territories of Azerbaijan, Armenians formed their “belonging only to 
Armenians”  monoethnic  state  by  purging  overall  Western 
Azerbaijan-  present  Armenia  from  Azerbaijanis  and  afterwards 
started striving for Garabagh. About 1 million people were driven 
out of Upper Garabagh and adjacent regions. Armenians committed 
inconceivable  tragedies  during Garabagh war,  the most  terrible  of 
www.avciya.az- 112 -

them is Khojaly tragedy. It was, indeed, one of the real genocide acts 
against  Azerbaijanis.  Unfortunately,  international  community  is 
unaware  of  the  true  essence  of  this  tragedy.  Parliaments  of  civil 
countries  have  not  expressed  their  legal  and  political  appraisal 
regarding the tragedy yet. Our archives are open for any researchers. 
We can put forward thousands of undeniable documents, collection 
of facts and stories of witnesses. If any honest Human being in spite 
of his/her nationality,  religion and race familiarized himself/herself 
with  these  documents,  without  any  hesitation  he/she  would  make 
sure  that  one  of  the  bloodiest  events  of  the  history-genocide  of 
Azerbaijanis  happened  in  Khojaly,  on  February  26,  in  1992.

TWICE PERSECUTED…
Many years  ago Great  friend of USSR nations  Iosif  Stalin 
signed the Resolution of Union of Ministers “on transmigration of 
collective farmers  and other Azerbaijani  population from Armenia 
SSR to Kur-Araksin plain of Azerbaijan SSR” with unprecedented 
absurdity,  from dictation  of  his  former  friend  A.  Mikoyan  on  23 
December, 1947. 
Striking  cynicism is  seen  in  each  item of  state  resolution. 
Judge for yourself, as the following issues are noted in the first item: 
“To  replace  100 000  collective  farmers  and  other  people  on 
voluntarily principles in 1947-1950, while in another item it is said 
that “duty of leaders of the ministries, offices and enterprises to fire 
persons, have been removed from Armenian SSR to Azerbaijan SSR, 
i.e. dismiss all aforementioned people. 
However,  the  next  item,  directions  of  native  Soviet 
government,  disposed  of  property  of  the  collective  farm  causes 
greater indignation: “To let Ministries Union of Armenia SSR to use 
constructions and apartment houses, left by Azerbaijani population in 
connection  with  settlement  to  Azerbaijani  SSR  to  reside  foreign 
Armenians”,  i.e.  Azerbaijanis  even were  not  allowed to  sell  their 
houses they built on their salary income. They were allowed neither 
to take away nor to sell his country production. It was also prohibited 
Azerbaijani  cattle-breeders  to  get  out  their  cattle  “according  to 
quarantine reason”. Does not it mean an open pillage?  
Sometimes  this  “voluntary  removal  of  Azerbaijanis  from 
Armenia”  is  compared  to  expulsion  of  Chechens,  Ingushes  and 
Crimean Tatars.  There  was political  basis,  while  in  our case it  is 
legal  ethnical  purge,  i.e.  genocide.  A  part  of  Azerbaijanis  were 
deported to Armenia for settling in Khanlar and Shamkhor regions, 
from where Germans were earlier expelled. Their place was willfully 
and  actively  occupied  by  Armenians  from  Nagorno-  Karabakh. 
www.avciya.az- 114 -
Khojaly genocide: million signatures – one demand
However,  Armenians  earlier  occupied  their  houses  and  lands 
violently resisted,  at  that  there  were many offenders among them. 
This fact was revealed by one of the settlers, Agamirza Bagir Rzayev 
who sheltered in Khanlar at house of Account Section head. In his 
due  course  Rzayev  worked  at  PCIA  of  Armenia  and  faced  with 
Dashnaks and offenders of Armenian nationality.  He displayed that 
many people were hiding in Khanlar city and their places were in 
order.  He  informed  Bagirov  that  offenders  kept  under  inquest  in 
Armenia lived in Kirovabad, Khanlar, and Ajikend at the moment. 
He cited their concrete names and addresses. 
Thus,  when Soviet  government  deported Azerbaijanis  from 
Armenia,  active  armenization  of  this  former  German  colony  was 
conducted  in  Khanlar.  Covering  aim  of  chairman  of  Executive 
Committee of the District Soviet of People's Deputies of Shamkhor 
Region Khojayan organized persecution for Azerbaijanis, deported 
from  Armenians.  He  created  his  commission  which  investigated 
houses of settlers, prepared “acts for illegally arrived” Azerbaijanis 
and took notes from them on three-day departure. M. Jafarov wrote 
interested on all of them in his book. He has been long ago occupied 
with history of German settlers.
The question is that, Armenians, comprising 10% of people 
of these regions assumed 90% of senior posts in general. Armenians 
headed  7  from  26  agricultural  Unions,  only  in  Shamhor  region. 
Secretary of their Party Karkaryan considered complaint, sent to M. 
Bagirov.  Armenians  signed petitions in Baku and Moscow, where 
they wrote about expulsions, committed by emigrants from Armenia 
and demanded to expel them from Shamhor and other regions.  
On 7 September, 1949 Minister of Azerbaijan State Security 
Ministry  S.  Yemelyanov  sent  complaint  under  the  name  of  his 
deputy who was in Ganja in that period and forwarded it to head of 
the  fifth  section  of  Azerbaijan  State  Security  Ministry….  With 
Armenian  nationality,  Abramov.  He  informed  that  emigrants,  i.e. 
Azerbaijanis, nationally- oriented ones, keep down local people, i.e. 
www.avciya.az- 115 -
Khojaly genocide: million signatures – one demand
Armenians-illegally  settlers.  Such  Azerbaijanis  passed  to  the 
provocation way and composition of anonymous letters. 
Thus, Azerbaijanis, deported from Armenia with the help of 
bodies  of  State  Security  Ministry  continued  to  be  kept  down by 
Armenians  and  also  by  several  Soviet  bodies  consisted  of 
Armenians. 
Persecuted  once  again became persecuted,  but  this  time  in 
their own motherland. 
Item,  where  USSR  Soviet  Ministry  obliged  to  the  Soviet 
Ministry  of  Azerbaijan  to  pay  up  all  damages,  carried  out  by 
emigrants out of republican budget is also considered unjust.

THE REPUBLIC OF ARMENIA 
AS THE SUPPORTER OF THE TERRORISM
After the collapse of the Soviet Union, when Armenia gained 
independence, it began to support terrorism on an official level, as a 
state, it adopted terrorism as an integral part of its aggressive policy.
Much evidence and forensic investigations prove that terrorist 
actions  against  civil  population  of  Azerbaijan  (among  them 
explosions  of  vehicles)  were  committed  by  special  services  of 
Armenia and financed by the Government of this state.           
In the beginning of the 1990’s the official circles of Armenia 
started  to  campaign  for  the  rehabilitation  of  the  activists  of 
Dashnaksutyun, ASALA, MAG, the Armenian Unity, the Armenian 
Liberation  Front  and  of  other  terrorist  organizations,  they  were 
rendered shelters, necessary financial support and created conditions 
for their living and activities.           
Armenia began officially to collect signatures for the release 
of Varojyan Garabedyan who committed a terrorist action in the Orli 
Airport  of Paris  in the July of 1983. As a result  of this  action,  8 
people  were  killed  and  60  were  wounded.  The  terrorist  was 
sentenced to life imprisonment. In 2001, the French court released 
him and he has found shelter in Armenia officially.          
Monte Melkonyan, a popular terrorist, leader of the grouping 
of the revolutionary movement of ASALA in the Western Europe, 
was sentenced to for six-year imprisonment by the French court on 
November 28, 1985 and was released in 1990. He came to Armenia 
and  then  sent  to  the  Nagorno-Karabakh  to  continue  his  terrorist 
actions.  Monte  Melkonyan  was  the  commander  of  the  Armenian 
terrorist detachment during the occupation of the Khojavand district 
of Azerbaijan. He was killed in the battles in Nagorno-Karabakh in 
1993 and buried in Yerevan. The officials of Armenia, including the 
Armenian  president,  took  part  in  his  funeral.  He  was  declared  a 
www.avciya.az- 117 -
Khojaly genocide: million signatures – one demand
national hero of Armenia and one of the subversive centers of the 
Ministry  of  Defense  began to  bear  the  name of  this  international 
terrorist.          
A popular terrorist, member of the terrorist “Dro” group of 
Dashnaksutyun party Grant Markaryan was one of the creators of the 
terrorist group in Nagorno-Karabakh and active participant of arming 
of the terrorist groups with the aid of arms, which were brought from 
Armenia.          
Vazgen  Sislyan,  organizer  of  the  attack  on  the  Turkish 
embassy in Paris in 1981, was awarded with the title of the heroes of 
the Karabakh war by the Armenian President Robert Kocharyan for 
his  active  participation  in  the  terrorist  actions  against 
Azerbaijanis.          
Abu Ali  and  Hilbert  Minasyan,  terrorists  from the  Middle 
East  by  origin,  are  protected  by  special  intelligence  agencies  of 
Armenia for slaughtering the peaceful Azerbaijani citizens. 
Terrorist-subversive actions committed
in the territory of Azerbaijan
Beginning  since  the  late  1980s,  Armenian  terrorist 
organizations, functioning in various countries of the world, began a 
constant  and  horrible  terrorist  war  against  Azerbaijan  with  the 
financial support of Armenia and the Armenian Diaspora. To spread 
horror among the population, to achieve great casualties during the 
occupation of the Nagorno-Karabakh territory of Azerbaijan and the 
adjoining 7 administrative districts, the special intelligence services 
of Armenia organized and committed terrorist  actions in locations 
populated by peaceful Azerbaijanis far from the territories where the 
battles were waged, and as a result more than 2 thousand of innocent 
people were killed and wounded.

It  became  known  that  the  activists  of  the  separatist 
organization (Sadval) had visited Armenia several times since 1992. 
The main department of National Security of Armenia has closely 
participated  in  the  formation,  financing  and  armament  of  this 
organization.  In April-May 1992, 17 Azerbaijani citizens,  Lezghin 
by  nationality,  underwent  special  training  in  subversion  at  the 
training base located in the settlement of Lusakert in the district of 
Nairi  of  Armenia.  It  has  become  evident  in  the  process  of 
investigation that the saboteurs planned to commit explosions in the 
cinema house of Nizami of Baku and in the Republican Palace, in the 
Baku  Lamp  Producing  Plant  in  conformity  with  the  instructions 
given to them.

July 3, 1994. 13 people were killed and 42 people injured as a 
result of the explosion between the subway stations “May 28” and

The terrorist action was committed by Aslanov Azer Salman 
oglu, citizen of Azerbaijan. He was taken captive by the Armenians 
in the battles in Nagorno-Karabakh in 1994 and then recruited by 
special agencies of Armenia. It was proven in court that on January 
14, 1994, one of the ideologists of the Armenian separatist’s writer 
Zori  Balayan  met  Azer  Aslanov,  a  military  captive,  Lezghin  by 
nationality, and tried to persuade him that it is necessary to unite all 
the minorities and fight against Azerbaijan and make use of terrorist 
actions.  On  June  9,  1994,  a  man  named  Arthur  from the  special 
service  agency  of  Armenia  rang  the  flat  of  A.Aslanov  in  Baku, 
saying that he was alive and asked one of his close relatives to come 
to Yerevan for negotiations for his release. On June 16, 1994, Tajibat 
Aslanova, mother of Azer Aslanov, went to Yerevan. Azer Aslanov 
was told that the life of his mother was in danger and under the threat 
he was compelled to be recruited as a permanent  agent  under the 
pseudonym  of  “Omar-75”.  To  organize  his  arrival  in  Azerbaijan 
without  any  obstacle  he  was  provided  with  false  documents, 
explosives  were  hidden  in  boxes  of  chocolate,  biscuits  and 
perfumery.         
A.Aslanov arrived in Baku by the route “Yerevan-Mineralnie 
vodi-Baku”, and on July 3, 1994, he committed the terrorist action in 
the underground train between the stations “May 28” and “Ganjlik” 
www.avciya.az- 123 -

in Baku and again returned to Yerevan. Only then his mother, who 
had remained as a hostage in Yerevan, was released.         
The investigation revealed that the organizers of the terrorist 
action  were  Karen  Bagdasaryan  (colonel)  and  Seyran  Sarkisyan 
(captain) from the special service agency of Armenia.          
It  was  completely  proven  during  the  investigation  led  by 
Supreme Court of the Republic of Azerbaijan that all terrorist actions 
mentioned  above  were  organized,  sponsored  and  equipped  by 
functionaries  of  the  illegal  regime  of  Nagorno-Karabakh,  Special 
Services and other governmental bodies of Armenia.

GENOCIDE OF AZERBAIJANI PEOPLE IN KHOJALY 
TOWN IS THE CRIME AGAINST 
PEACE AND MANKIND
(analysis of national and international criminal legislation)
PART I
Khojaly as a fact of international crime
     
Genocide (Greek- γένος - clan, tribe and Latin caedo – I kill) 
is  an  international  crime  apparent  in  actions  committed  with  the 
purpose  to  destroy totally  or  partly  any national,  ethnic,  racial  or 
religious group by the way of:
- Killing members of a group;
- Grave damnification to their health;
-forced prevention of procreation;
-coercive abdication of children;
-forced resettlement; 
-arrangement of other living conditions, meant for destruction 
of this group.
Unfortunately, many cases of genocide acts can be found in 
the history of mankind beginning from ancient times up to our days. 
It  is  especially  characteristic  for  the  wars  of  annihilation  and 
devastating invasions, campaigns of conquerors and inner ethnic and 
religious  collisions  in  the  period  of  division  of  the  world  and 
formation of colonial empires of European powers. The process of 
vehement strife for repartition of the world led to two world wars 
and colonial wars after World War II. 
The genocide crime got an international legal status only in 
1948 (“Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime 
of Genocide”).  Genocide is recognized not only as an international 
crime. Thus, criminal responsibility for genocide as a crime against 
www.avciya.az- 127 -
Khojaly genocide: million signatures – one demand
peace  and  security  of  mankind  is  in  particular  applied  in  the 
Azerbaijan Republic (Article 103 of the Criminal Code).
Public danger of genocide lies in the fact that, as a result of 
commitment of acts forming this crime, a definite national, ethnic, 
racial or religious group of people,  characterized by originality of 
traditions, mode of life, culture and other features of life activity can 
become extinct fully or partly. It leads or can lead to pauperization of 
multiplicity of human community and undermines fundamentals of 
international legal order. It is proclaimed in the General declaration 
on human rights,  adopted by the General  Assembly of the United 
Nations on 10 December, 1948, that each person has the right to life, 
freedom and personal  immunity;  no  one  should  be the  subject  to 
tortures or cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment and penalty; each 
person, wherever he or she is, has the right to recognition of his legal 
personality; all the people are equal before law and have the right to 
equal protection by law without distinction.
Genocide  is  the  gravest  violation  of  generally  recognized 
principles  and  the  international  law  standards,  as  well  as  human 
rights and freedoms.
From the objective part, genocide can become apparent in the 
commitment of one or several following acts:
 -  full  or  partial  murder  of  members  of  a  national,  ethnic, 
racial or religious group of people;
-  infliction  of  grave  harm to  the  health  of  members  of  a 
national, ethnic, racial or religious group of people; 
-  forced  prevention  of  procreation  within  the  above 
mentioned groups of people;
-  coercive  abdication  of  children  born  in  the  midst  of  the 
mentioned  groups  of  people  in  favour  of  representatives  of  other 
national, ethnic, racial or religious groups of people; 
- arrangement of other living conditions leading to physical 
destruction  of  members  of  a  national,  ethnic,  racial  or  religious 
group.
www.avciya.az- 128 -
Khojaly genocide: million signatures – one demand
The criminal  consequence of the acts,  forming genocide is 
intentional  deprivation  of  life  of  members  of  the listed  groups of 
people, causing grave harm to their health,  deprivation of parents’ 
opportunity to bring up their  children  in due living conditions,  as 
well  as  violent  deprivation  of  men’s  and  women’s  ability  for 
reproduction. 
At that, a national group of people should be perceived as a 
group  of  people,  related  by  belonging  to  a  certain  nationality 
independently  of  its  living  territory.  A nation  is  understood  as  a 
historically formed group of people, characterized by commonality 
of a language, mentality and culture, as well as a living territory and 
other features of life and traditions. 
An ethnic group is perceived as a group of people, connected 
by belonging of its members to a definite nation. 
A  racial  group  is  understood  as  a  group  of  people 
characterized by definite totality of secondary outward signs (colour 
of skin, hair, eyes, shape of a head, height etc.) and other historically 
formed innate features. 
A  religious  group  is  a  definite  community  of  people 
practicing a respective religion, distinct from a religion dominant in a 
given society.   
Forced  prevention  of  procreation  includes  both  illegal 
castration and sterilization of people at reproductive age and practice 
of forced abortion against a woman’s will, as well as other violent 
acts  directed  to  disturbance  of  procreation  within  such  groups  of 
people. 
Coercive abdication of children of a certain national, ethnic 
or another group in favour of representatives of other national, ethnic 
and other groups of people is perceived as withdrawal of children 
from  their  parents  against  their  will  (free  or  for  payment)  and 
handing them over to other people who are not their relatives. 
Forced resettlement of indicated in the law groups of people 
is  their  removal  to  other,  unsuitable  for  them climatic  and  other 
www.avciya.az- 129 -
Khojaly genocide: million signatures – one demand
natural  conditions,  which leads  to the  extinction  of corresponding 
groups of people. 
Arrangement of other living conditions, provided for physical 
destruction  of  members  of  such  groups is  understood as  intended 
implementation of measures and actions making inevitable death of 
people under these or other circumstances (contaminating of natural 
habitat  of  an  ethnic  group  with  radioactive,  chemical  or  biologic 
toxins and substances, prohibition to be occupied with the activity 
considered to be a basic source of existence of people group etc.). 
Genocide  is  a  consummated  crime  since  the  moment  of 
appearance of the consequences indicated in the law. Upon absence 
of  a  causal  connection  between  a  sequel  and  perpetrated  acts,  a 
committed action does not produce components of genocide. 
A subject of this crime can be both people, occupying state 
positions and private persons aged 16 and sane. 
From the subjective part, genocide is characterized by a plain 
intent.  The aim of a guilty one is  total  or partial  destruction of a 
corresponding national, ethical, racial or religious group of people by 
the methods indicated in the law. 
The  Khojaly  genocide  should  be  included  into  the  most 
known  genocide  facts  of  XX  century.  In  fact,  all  the  peaceful 
population  of  Khojaly  town  was  wildly  murdered  during  the 
Armenian  armed  aggression  15  years  ago.  Among  mass  murder 
cases  in  the  mankind  history,  mass  murder  of  Azerbaijanis  in 
Khojaly got the name of “Khojaly slaughter”.  
“Khojaly  slaughter”  is  a  mass  murder  of  settlers  of 
Azerbaijani Khojaly town by Armenian troops, which went down in 
history  as  the  bloodiest  tragedy of  the  Karabakh conflict.  On the 
night of 26 February,  1992, Armenian troops, with the support of 
heavy  weapons  and  personnel  of  the  Stepanakert-based  366th 
Motorized Infantry Regiment of the former USSR, invaded Khojaly 
town. Hundreds of the town’s peaceful residents, including women 
and children died as a result.  
www.avciya.az- 130 -
Khojaly genocide: million signatures – one demand
The storm of Khojaly by Armenian troops was predestined by 
its strategic location.  The town, the population of which was about 
6300 people in 1991, was situated 10 kilometers to the south-east of 
Stepanakert  in  the  chain  of  the  Karabakh  Mountains.  Aghdam-
Shusha and Askeran-Stepanakert roads pass through Khojaly and the 
only airport in Karabakh is located there. 
In  view  of  the  events  of  the  latest  years,  54  families  of 
Meskhetian  Turks  escaped  from Fergana  (Uzbekistan),  as  well  as 
Azerbaijanis  expatriated  from  other  settlements  of  Nagorno-
Karabakh and Armenia sheltered in the town. Just due to this reason, 
the construction of branches of the largest industrial  enterprises of 
Azerbaijan,  residential  buildings  and  other  public  objects  was 
expanded in the town. 
Khojaly was practically  blocked by Armenian  troops  since 
autumn 1991, but a complete blockade set in after the withdrawal of 
internal troops from Nagorno-Karabakh.  Khojaly was not supplied 
with electric power since January 1992. A part of residents left the 
blocked town, however, complete evacuation of peaceful population 
was not arranged despite insistent requests of the head of Khojaly 
executive power E. Mammadov. 
It was possible to get to the town only by helicopter: a short 
flight  from Aghdam and  then  a  jerky  cork-screw  landing.  When 
American reporter Thomas Goltz made this terrible flight in January, 
a cold and unprotected town appeared before him. “Telephones did 
not  work.  Nothing  worked  in  Khojaly:  there  was  no  electricity, 
heating  or  tap  water”,  -Goltz  wrote  –  “helicopters  were  the  only 
means of communication with outer world and each flight was of 
high-risk”. In all,  less than 300 dwellers had been evacuated from 
Khojaly by 13 February,  1992 when the last helicopter  flight was 
made.
Russian human rights center “Memorial”, conducting its own 
investigation of the tragedy circumstances asserts that there were 2-4 
thousand residents in Khojaly by the moment of assault, including 
www.avciya.az- 131 -
Khojaly genocide: million signatures – one demand
several  hundreds  of  town  defenders.  Khojaly  was  protected  by 
volunteers,  personnel  of  Special  Task  Forces  of  the  Azerbaijan 
Republic Ministry of Interior and soldiers of the Azerbaijan National 
Army. According to the information obtained from both sides, there 
were three units of armoured vehicles and an “Alazan” emplacement 
in the town. According to the assault participants and officials of the 
Nagorno-Karabakh  Republic,  there  were  also  2  “Grad”  artillery 
mounts of volley fire in Khojaly.  
The  “Memorial”  reports  that  according  to  officials  of  the 
Nagorno-Karabakh Republic, a “free corridor” was left for peaceful 
population of Khojaly,  which started from eastern outskirts  of the 
town, passed along the bed of the river and stretched to north-west, 
leading to Aghdam and leaving Askeran on the left. The width of the 
corridor was 100-200 meters and in some parts up to 300 meters. The 
Armenians promised not to fire at peaceful population and members 
of armed units leaving without arms and keeping within the bounds 
of this “corridor”. According to officials of the Nagorno-Karabakh 
Republic and participants of the assault, the population of Khojaly 
was notified of the existence of such “corridor” through loudspeakers 
installed  on  armored  carriers  at  the  beginning  of  the  assault. 
However,  reporting  persons  did  not  exclude  that,  a  great  part  of 
Khojaly population might not have heard the information on a “free 
corridor” because of shooting and low power of loudspeakers. 
60 people who escaped from Khojaly during the assault were 
questioned  by observers  of  the  “Memorial”  in  Agdam and  Baku. 
Only one of the inquired informed that  he had been aware of the 
“free corridor” (a  soldier  of  Khojaly garrison told him).  Detained 
Khojaly settlers, with whom observers of the “Memorial” talked in 
presence of Deputy R. Ayrikyan in a Stepanakert temporary jail, had 
heard nothing about the “free corridor”.

PART II
The Khojaly massacre started on the night of 26 February. 
This day was possibly chosen in memory of Armenian massacres 
happened  in  Sumgait  4  years  ago.  Armenians  were  military 
supported  by  armoured  carriers  of  the  366th  Motorized  Infantry 
Regiment  of the Soviet  Army.  They encircled Khojaly from three 
sides  and  after  that,  Armenian  soldiers  entered  the  town  and 
suppressed the resistance of defenders.
A part of population started to leave Khojaly trying to reach 
Agdam shortly after the beginning of the attack. Armed people from 
the  town’s  garrison  were  among  the  groups  of  escaping  people. 
People  went  in  two  directions  as  indicated  in  the  report  of  the 
“Memorial” human rights organization:
From the outskirts of the town to south-east along the river-
bed, leaving Askeran on the left (due to Armenian officials, just this 
way was left as a “free corridor”); 
From the south outskirts  of  the town to south-east  leaving 
Askeran on the right (obviously, a lesser part of refugees went this 
way). 
According to the “Memorial”, “unstated quantity of peaceful 
settlers  died  in  the  territory  of  Khojaly  during  the  slaughter  as  a 
result  of  shelling.  The  Armenian  side  refused  to  introduce 
information on a number of people died in such a way”.
Due to  the  “Memorial”,  “a  great  stream of  settlers  rushed 
from the town along the river-bed (the 1st way). Armed people from 
the  town garrison  were  among  several  groups  of  refugees.  These 
refugees, passing along the “free corridor” in the territory adjoining 
to Agdam region of Azerbaijan were gunned and many died as a 
result.  The survived refugees dispersed.  Escaping people stumbled 
upon Armenian  outposts  and were shot  down. A part  of  refugees 
could  nevertheless  pass  to  Agdam;  a  part,  especially  women  and 
children (an exact number is impossible to determine) froze during 
www.avciya.az- 133 -

wandering in the mountains  and a part,  according to  people,  who 
reached Agdam, was captured next to Pirjamal and Nakhichevanik 
villages. There are testimonies of interchanged Khojaly residents that 
some captives were later on shot down”.
A group of refugees, following the second way and leaving 
Askeran on their right, were also shot down. 
These  events  happened  in  the  period  when  Minister  of 
Foreign Affairs of the Iran Islam Republic Ali Akbar Vilayati arrived 
in  the  region  with  intermediary  mission.  He  met  Azerbaijani 
administration in Baku on 25 February. On February 27, he should 
have flown to Karabakh and later to Armenia. In this connection, due 
to an agreement reached by the sides, 3-day cease-fire (February 27 - 
March 1) was announced, but it was also ignored by the Armenian 
side.  It  was  the  same  on  February  12  when  the  mission  of  the 
Organization  for  Security  and  Cooperation  in  Europe  (OSCE) 
arrived  in  Karabakh  to  get  acquainted  with  the  situation  in  the 
conflict territory and analyze an opportunity of its settlement, which 
later on had to visit Yerevan and Baku. Malybaily and Gushchular 
villages of Shusha region were occupied by Armenian invaders just 
on 12 February. As a result, the villages were totally plundered and 
burnt  down.  About  50  people  were  killed,  wounded  and  taken 
hostage only in Malybaily village. 
In  those  days,  Azerbaijani  forces  were  not  able  to  break 
through  to  help  Khojaly  people.  They  could  not  even  take  away 
corpses.  Meanwhile,  special  groups  of  Armenians  in  white 
camouflages searched for people on helicopters in forest tracks.  The 
groups,  coming  out  of  the  forest  were  shot  down,  captured  and 
exposed to tortures.
A group of local journalists could get to the massacre place 
on  two  helicopters  on  28  February.  The  tragic  sight  terrified 
everybody – a field was studded with dead bodies. Despite the air-
cover of the second helicopter, they managed to take away only 4 
corpses because of strong fire by Armenian militants.  Russian TV 
www.avciya.az- 134 -
Khojaly genocide: million signatures – one demand
reporter  Yuri  Romanov,  who  first  arrived  at  the  site  of  tragedy 
together with Azerbaijani journalist  Chingiz Mustafayev,  recounts: 
“I look out from a window (of a helicopter) and literally recoil from 
an improbably terrible picture. Dead people lie on the yellow grass 
of  foothills  where  grey  spots  of  snow  and  remains  of  winter 
snowdrifts are still melting in a shade. The huge square is studded up 
to the close garrison with corpses of young and old men and women, 
boys and girls of all ages from infants to minors…. An eye catches 
two figures from the jumble – a grandmother and a little girl. The 
grandmother with grey uncovered head lies on the earth face down 
together with a tiny girl in a blue jacket with a hood. Their legs are 
tied with barbwire for some reason and besides, the grandmother’s 
hands are tied too. Both were shot in the heads. With the last gesture, 
a  little,  4-year-old  girl  stretches  her  hands  to  the  murdered 
grandmother.  Going dizzy,  I do not even remember the camera at 
once….”
An awful picture of bloody war appeared before a group of 
foreign and local journalists on March 1 when they arrived at the site 
of  tragedy.  Torn  to  pieces  bodies  lied  everywhere  on  the  frozen 
ground. Anatol Lieven, the London “Times”, reported that “some of 
them, including one little  girl  had horrible wounds in their  heads. 
Only her face remained intact.” 
Correspondent of the “Izvestiya” paper V. Belykh stated that 
the bodies of killed people, exchanged for live hostage, were from 
time  to  time  brought  to  Agdam.  But  it  can  not  even appear  in  a 
nightmare: pricked out eyes, cut off ears, scalped and cut off heads… 
There  were  also  sheaves  of  several  bodies  that  had  been  long 
dragged  over  the  ground,  roped  to  armoured  troop-carriers. 
Humiliations are boundless…”. He brings the evidence of helicopter 
pilot of Russian Air Forces Leonid Cravats (major): “I took away 
wounded people from Stepanakert on 26 February and was returning 
through  Askeran  gates.  Several  bright  spots  on  the  ground  were 
www.avciya.az- 135 -
Khojaly genocide: million signatures – one demand
striking. I lost height and my flight mechanic cried: “Look, there are 
women and children down there”.
Yes, now I could also see about 200 killed and thrown all 
over  the  slope  people.  Some  armed  men  were  wandering  among 
them. Later on, we flew to pick up bodies. A local police captain was 
together with us. He saw there his 4-year-old son with the crushed 
skull and went mad. The head of another child, whom we picked up 
before we started to be shot, was cut off. I could see maimed bodies 
of women, children and old men everywhere”. 
The  “Memorial”  human  rights  organization  states  that, 
actions of Armenian armed forces of Nagorno-Karabakh in respect 
of peaceful  Khojaly population  during the storm of Khojaly town 
roughly contradict the Geneva Convention, as well as the following 
Articles of General Declaration on Human Rights (adopted by the 
UN General Assembly, 10.12.1948): 
Article 2, declaring that each person should possess all  the 
rights and freedoms proclaimed by the present Declaration without 
any distinction in respect of …language, religion, national ...origin…
or other status; 
Article  3,  recognizing  the  right  of  each  person  to  life, 
freedom and personal immunity; 
Article 5, banning crude, inhuman or degrading treatment; 
Article 9, banning arbitrary arrests, detention or banishment;
Article 17, proclaiming the right of each person to ownership 
of property and banning arbitrary deprivation of property of a person.
Actions of armed forces roughly contradict  the Declaration 
on the Protection of Women and Children in Emergency and Armed 
Conflict (proclaimed by the UN General Assembly, 14.12.1974.)”. 
The “Memorial” reports that about 200 bodies were brought 
to Agdam within four days.  Several  tens of corpses had traces of 
malicious injuries. 
At least four scalped bodies and a body with the cut off head 
were fixed by the doctors of a sanitary train of Agdam town.  State 
www.avciya.az- 136 -
Khojaly genocide: million signatures – one demand
forensic  medical  examination  of  181  bodies  (130  male  and  51 
female,  including 13 children)  was carried out in Agdam. Experts 
concluded that bullet wounds were the reason for the death of 151 
people, missile wounds – 20 people and blows with an obtuse object 
–  10  people.  Furthermore,  medical  examination  of  some  bodies, 
delivered from the Khojaly region was made in Baku”. 
Besides those who died of gunshot wounds, tens of people 
died of cold and frostbite in forests. More than a thousand of Khojaly 
residents,  including  tens  of  Meskhetian  Turks  -  refugees  from 
Central Asia, were captured. 
According to  the official  data  of Azerbaijan authority,  485 
people, including frozen to death, died as a result of this tragedy (T. 
de Waal  “Black garden”).  This  number  includes  63 children,  106 
women  and  70  aged.  8  families  were  completely  annihilated,  25 
children lost both parents and 130 lost only one parent. Besides, 487 
people were wounded (76 of them are children). 1275 people were 
taken hostage and 150 people were missing.
According to Tom de Waal,  the author of “Black Garden” 
book, even considering that people, who died not only in skirmish, 
but  also  of  overcooling  are  registered  here,  this  great  figure 
overshadows the data on losses during all the history of Nagorno-
Karabakh war. Retaliatory fire of Azerbaijanis was insignificant and 
it can by no means extenuate the cool-blooded murder in an open 
field of hundreds of helpless peaceful residents, including children. 
The  “Memorial”  reports  that  “officials  of  the  Nagorno-
Karabakh Republic and members of Armenian troops explained the 
death of peaceful population within the “free corridor” by the fact 
that armed people, who shot at Armenian outposts, thereby causing 
retaliatory fire, were leaving together with refugees, as well as by the 
breach  attempt  by  the  Azerbaijani  major  forces.  According  to 
members of Armenian troops, attempt of armed breach towards the 
“free corridor” was made by Azerbaijani forces from Agdam side. At 
the moment when Armenian outposts were repulsing an attack, the 
www.avciya.az- 137 -
Khojaly genocide: million signatures – one demand
first  groups  of  Khojaly  refugees  approached  them.  Armed  people 
started  firing  at  Armenian  outposts.  One  post  was  destroyed  (2 
people were killed and 10 were wounded), however, the fighters of 
another post, hidden to Azerbaijanis opened short range fire at the 
people streaming from Khojaly. Due to the testimonies of Khojaly 
refugees  (including  testimonies  published  in  the  press),  armed 
people,  moving  in  the  stream  of  refugees  went  into  action  with 
Armenian outposts, but each time the Armenian side started shooting 
first. 
The “Memorial” reports that mass violence against peaceful 
population of Khojaly town took place during the military operation. 
Information on existence of a “free corridor” was not brought to the 
notice  of  the  majority  of  Khojaly  people.  Massacre  of  peaceful 
residents within the “free corridor” and adjacent territory can not be 
excused by any circumstances.  As regards the participation of the 
366th Motorized Infantry Brigade in the operations, the “Memorial” 
also demanded to conduct a special investigation over the facts of 
participation  of  the  CIS  soldiers  in  the  military  operations  and 
hostilities in the conflict region, as well as the facts of handing over 
of  military  property  to  the  formations  of  conflicting  sides.  The 
“Human  Rights  Watch”  international  human  rights  organization 
called  the  Khojaly  tragedy  “the  greatest  slaughter  during  the 
conflict”.  In  the  opinion  of  the  organization,  the  Armenian 
formations bear direct responsibility for the death of civil persons.
The “Memorial” reports that “more than 700 captive Khojaly 
settlers  detained both in the town and on the way to Agdam, had 
been handed over to Azerbaijan side by 28 March, 1992 according to 
testimonies  of both sides.  The majority of them were women and 
children. Furthermore, the testimonies of Khojaly dwellers show that 
women  and  children,  as  well  as  men  were  kept  as  “exchange 
material”.
As  regards  the  “Memorial”,  the  Supreme  Soviet  of  the 
Nagorno-Karabakh Republic issued a statement where it expressed 
www.avciya.az- 138 -
Khojaly genocide: million signatures – one demand
regret  over  the  cases  of  cruelty  upon  the  capture  of  Khojaly. 
However,  no  attempt  to  investigate  crimes  connected  with  the 
capture of Khojaly was made. Officials did not deny in talks with the 
“Memorial” observers that atrocity could take place upon the capture 
of Khojaly, as there were embittered people among the members of 
Armenian troops whose relatives had been killed by Azerbaijanis, as 
well as people with the criminal past.
Tom  de  Waal  cites  Serge  Sarkisyan,  the  present  defense 
minister of Armenia: “Azerbaijanis thought they could make jokes 
with us until Khojaly; they thought that Armenians would not raise 
their hand to civil population. We managed to break this stereotype. 
Besides, it  should be also taken into account that people who had 
escaped from Baku and Sumgait were among those boys”.
In De Waal’s opinion, “Sarkisyan’s appraisal allows viewing 
the  most  brutal  massacre  of  the  Karabakh  war  from  another 
standpoint. It is not inconceivable that these massive murders were a 
prepense act of frightening”.
We consider that these statements are mockery not only over 
the memory of innocent victims of this massacre, but also over the 
entire  Azerbaijani  nation.  It  should  entail  reaction  of  the  world 
society.  This  statement,  coming from the leader  of  military body, 
once again confirms the necessity and lateness of instituting a special 
international tribunal in regard to the Khojaly massacre in order to 
debar  not  only the  similar  tragedy,  but  also  such  kind  of  official 
statements.  Especially  since  there  are  valid  legal  grounds  for 
bringing  these  “persons”  to  international  criminal  responsibility 
under  the  criminal  legislation  of  the  Azerbaijan  Republic.  Thus, 
article  103 (Genocide)  of  the  AR Criminal  Code  reads:  “actions, 
directed to total or partial annihilation of a national, ethnic, racial or 
a religious group by murder of members of this group, infliction of 
grave harm to their health or serious harm to their mental abilities, 
arrangement  of  living  conditions,  provided  for  total  or  partial 
physical  destruction  of members  of this  group, implementation  of 
www.avciya.az- 139 -
Khojaly genocide: million signatures – one demand
measures  directed  to prevention  of  child  birth  inside a  group and 
forced  handing  over  of  children  of  one  group  to  another,  are 
penalized  by  imprisonment  from  10  to  15  years  or  by  life 
imprisonment”. 
Note:  Crimes  against  security  of  humanity  are  recognized 
intended actions, provided by articles 103-113 of the given chapter 
and being a component part of large-scale or systematic attacks to 
civil population both in peaceful and war time.
Besides,  according  to  article  1  of  the  Convention  on 
Prevention  and  Punishment  of  Crime  of  Genocide,  dated  9 
December,  1948,  genocide  is  considered  a  crime,  breaking  the 
standards  of  international  law,  independently  of  whether  it  is 
committed in peaceful or war time and which is subject to prevention 
and penalty by contracting parties.
Tens  of  children,  women  and old  people  were  shot  point-
blank  during  this  barbarous  operation.  Armenian  terrorist 
organizations  and  hired  armed  formations  destroyed  the  whole 
families and arranged “demonstrative” executions:  rawed skin, cut 
off ears and scalped alive. Ordinary fascism: pregnant women were 
disemboweled…having taken out a baby…the cut off heads of their 
husbands…were pushed into the ripped up abdomens of already dead 
women...and  then…abdomens  were  sewed  up.  All  this  is  beyond 
description.  One  of  active  militants  of  the  Armenian  terrorist 
ASALA organization Vargen Sislyan, whose name is connected with 
the number of bloody terrorist acts committed worldwide, didn’t hide 
from the press his implication to the murder of Azerbaijani children 
in  Khojaly.  It  is  characteristic  that  later  on,  V.Sislyan  will  be 
recognized a hero of the Karabakh war by initiative of President of 
the Armenian Republic Robert Kocharyan. 
Armenian  author  Daud  Kheyriyan,  the  participant  of  the 
Khojaly  tragedy writes  in  his  book:  “On March  2,  the  Armenian 
“Gaflan” group (dealing with burning out corpses) picked up more 
than 100 corpses of Turks (Azerbaijanis  – edit.)  and burned them 
www.avciya.az- 140 -
Khojaly genocide: million signatures – one demand
down about a kilometer far to the east of Khojaly…I saw a 10-year-
old girl with wounded arms and forehead in the last car. This child 
with the face turned  blue was still  alive  despite  hunger,  cold  and 
wounds. She breathed faintly.  I can’t  forget the eyes  of that child 
struggling with death. Very soon, soldier named Tigranyan took this 
motionless girl  and threw over other corpses. Later on, they were 
burnt. Someone seemed to be shouting among the burning corpses, 
begging for help … After that, I couldn’t walk any further”. A film 
made  by  eminent  Azerbaijani  documentary  producer  Chingiz 
Mustafayev told the world about the bloody tragedy of Khojaly. A 
camera  recorded  children  with  cut  off  ears  and  scalped  men. 
Armenian bearded men cut away the skin from the left side of an 
aged woman’s face. All the corpses had traces of atrocious tortures. 
Destruction of Azerbaijani Khojaly town by Armenian terrorists was 
recognized in the USA “the largest tragedy of the year”. Later on, the 
366th Motorized Regiment was relocated to Russia and disbanded, 
nevertheless none of its officers responded for committed crimes.   
The  appeal  of  President  of  the  Azerbaijan  Republic  to 
Azerbaijani  nation  connected  with  the  10th  anniversary  of  the 
Khojaly  tragedy  says:  “This  brutal  and  ruthless  act  of  genocide 
entered  the  history  of  mankind  as  one  of  the  most  terrible  mass 
terrorist acts… Today, the objective of Azerbaijan state and nation is 
to deliver the truth about Khojaly genocide and outrages committed 
by Armenians in Nagorno-Karabakh as a whole with all their scales 
and horrors to states, parliaments and the public of the world to gain 
recognition of all this as an act of undoubted genocide. It is our civil 
and human duty in the memory of Khojaly victims.  On the other 
side,  adequate  international  and  political  legal  evaluation  of  this 
tragedy and punishment of its ideologists, inspirers and executors is 
the important guarantee that such brutal acts, aimed against humanity 
as a whole will never repeat”.

February-March  1992.  Foreign  mass-media  testified  a 
genocide fact committed by Armenian terrorist and gangster groups 
in Khojaly town. 
The “Washington Post” newspaper. Victims of the Nagorno-
Karabakh war buried in a town of Azerbaijan: “Refugees tell  that 
hundreds of people died during Armenian aggression. Bodies of 7 
dead people were shown today; 2 of them were children and 3 were 
women.  120 refugees are in Agdam hospital;  there  are many stab 
wounds on their bodies”. 
The  “Times”  newspaper.  Armenian  soldiers  slaughtered 
hundreds of refugee families. The survived informed that Armenian 
soldiers  shot  more  than  450  Azerbaijanis,  many  of  whom  were 
women  and  children.  Hundreds  and  possibly  thousands  were 
missing.  “They  were  shooting,  shooting  and  shooting”,  -  Razin 
Aslanova  who arrived  in  Agdam together  with  other  women  and 
children escaped from Khojaly said. Her husband Kayun and stepson 
were killed and her daughter was missing”. 
Massacre is apparent. Anatoly Levin: - “More than 60 killed, 
including women and children were found on slopes of the hills in 
Nagorno-Karabakh,  which  verified  statements  on  massacre  of 
Azerbaijani refugees committed by Armenian troops.  Hundreds of 
refugees  have  not  been  found  up  to  now.  Many  people  were 
mutilated and only the head remained from one little girl”. 
The “Izvestiya” newspaper. A video camera showed children 
with cut off ears. One old woman’s half-face was chopped off. Men 
were scalped. 
The “Sunday Times” newspaper. Tomas Goltz was the first 
reporter  to  inform  on  the  massacre  made  by  Armenian  soldiers. 
“Khojaly was barren Azerbaijani town with empty shops and dirty 
roads without trees. Nevertheless,  it  was a house for thousands of 
Azerbaijanis who in better times tilled the fields and bred geese. It 
was razed to the ground last week”.
www.avciya.az- 142 -
Khojaly genocide: million signatures – one demand
The “Financial  Times” newspaper. Armenians shot down a 
column of refugees moving to Agdam. Azerbaijanis recorded nearly 
1200 corpses. A Lebanese cameraman attested that the rich Dashnak 
commune of his country sent weapons and people to Karabakh. 
The  “Izvestiya”  newspaper.  Major  Leonid  Kravetz:  “I  saw 
nearly hundred corpses on the hill. One boy was even without head. 
Corpses  of  grimly  killed  women,  children  and  aged  people  were 
everywhere”. 
The “Financial  Times” newspaper. General Polyakov stated 
that  103  Armenian  soldiers  from  the  366th  regiment  stayed  in 
Nagorno-Karabakh.
The  “La  Mond”  newspaper.  Foreign  journalists,  visiting 
Agdam  saw  among  the  women  and  children  killed  in  Khojaly 
scalped  corpses  with  pulled  out  nails.  It  is  not  Azerbaijani 
propaganda, but reality. 
The “Valer actual” journal. Armenian military formations in 
this  autonomous  region  together  with  bullies  from the  Near  East 
possess the most modern military equipment, including helicopters. 
ASALA has  military  camps  and ammunition  depots  in  Syria  and 
Lebanon. Armenians annihilated Azerbaijanis of Karabakh making 
massacre in more than 100 Moslem villages. 
The  “Krua  l’Eveneman”  magazine.  “Armenians  attacked 
Khojaly region. The whole world witnessed disfigured corpses. The 
Azerbaijani speak about 1000 murdered”.
According  to  the  scientific  research  of  Expert  Council  of 
Institute on Human Rights of the National Academy of Sciences of 
Azerbaijan (reports of V. Ibayev and E. Gadirov), the above tragic 
events are interpreted in the international law as follows:
 
www.avciya.az- 143 -
Khojaly genocide: million signatures – one demand
I. Khojaly genocide, as international crime against humanity
     
The juridical  sense of “genocide” conception is determined 
by the Convention “On the Prevention and Punishment of Crime of 
Genocide” adopted  by Resolution  260 A (III)  of the UN General 
Assembly, dated December 1948 and specifies the following actions 
intended to total or partial destruction of any national, ethnic, racial 
or religious group: killing of members of a group; causing serious 
bodily  or  mental  harm  to  the  members  of  a  group;  deliberately 
inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to bring about its 
physical destruction in whole or in part; imposing measures intended 
to prevent births within the group; forcibly transferring children of 
the group to another group .  
Existence  of  special  intention  is  considered  a  requisite 
element  for  genocide  crime.  This  objective  feature  distinguishes 
genocide  crime  from analogous  international  crimes.  Each  of  the 
actions  forming  genocide  crime  is  conscious  and  premeditated. 
These actions can be on no account committed accidentally or as a 
result of indiscretion. Meanwhile, intentions to commit such actions 
and  general  perception  of  their  possible  consequences  are 
insufficient for their qualification as genocide. A special direction of 
a  criminal  or  definite  intention  connected  with  negative 
consequences of an action is required to be uncovered here. Shooting 
from automatic machines, machine-guns and other types of weapons 
from  beforehand  laid  ambushes  of  Azerbaijani  civil  population 
trying to survive, proves the genocide intention. 
Orientation of this crime against Azerbaijani national group is 
evident.  Three of its basic component  parts are revealed upon the 
analysis of the genocide crime: 1) existence of a definite national, 
ethnic, racial or religious group; 2) existence of intentions to destroy 
such a group in whole or partially (mens res); 3) commitment of any 
actions, interpreted as genocide in respect of a definite group (actus 
reus).
www.avciya.az- 144 -
Khojaly genocide: million signatures – one demand
Consequently,  a  genocide  act  should  be  directed  against  a 
national, ethnic, racial or religious group, i.e. actions directed against 
other groups, for instance, political or social, could not be qualified 
as genocide.  “Genocide” conception requires existence of a definite 
intention  due  to  general  consequences  of  prohibited  actions.  An 
intention, as a qualified sign of genocide crime unites several various 
component parts:
- an intention should not mean the accidental destruction of 
one or several persons, belonging to this or other definite group, but 
the  destruction  of  a  group  in  general.  Not  the  individuality,  but 
belonging  to  a  group  is  the  decisive  sign  of  determination  of 
genocide victims;  
- an intention should mean the destruction of a group as such. 
Genocide is  denial  to  recognize  the right  to existence  of  a  whole 
human  group,  whereas  a  murder  of  an  individual  (homicide)  is 
characterized as refusal to recognize the right to life of a separate 
individual. 
Accordingly, actus reus (prohibited action) can be limited by 
one  person,  but  mens  res  (intention)  should  be  aimed  against 
existence of a group;
an intention should just mean the full or partial destruction of 
a group; 
an intention should mean the full or partial destruction of one 
of national, ethnic, racial or religious groups. 
Achievement of a final result, as the destruction of a whole 
group  is  not  required  for  qualification  of  responsibility  for  a 
genocide  crime.  Commitment  of  one  of  the  actions,  forming  the 
objective side of a crime intended to destruct totally or partially an 
ethnic  group  as  such  is  sufficient  for  it.  The  conception  of 
destruction, being the objective side of genocide means deprivation 
of  life  through  physical  and  biological  influence.  The  UN 
International  Court,  in  its  decision  on  “Barcelona  Traction”  case 
specified  obligations  on  prohibition  of  genocide  acts  as  “erga 
www.avciya.az- 145 -
Khojaly genocide: million signatures – one demand
omnes”.  The  International  Court  recognized  principles,  which 
underlied  the  Convention  “On  prevention  of  genocide  crime  and 
penalty for it” as standards of obligatory character for all the states.
II.  Juridical grounds of recognition of Khojaly events by the 
international law as an act of genocide crime 
The  following  documents  allow  qualifying  Khojaly  events 
based on the international law as an act of genocide crime: 1) The 
Convention  “On  the  Prevention  and  Punishment  of  Crime  of 
Genocide” adopted  by Resolution  260 A (III)  of the UN General 
Assembly  on  9  December,  1948;  2)  The  Charter  of  Nuernberg 
Military Tribunal, (although a direct reference to genocide crime is 
absent in the Charter, the actions forming genocide are qualified here 
as crimes against humanity and military crimes; 3) The Charter of 
International  Criminal  Tribunal  on Yugoslavia  (Article  4);  4)  The 
Charter of International Criminal Tribunal on Rwanda (Article I); 5) 
The  Statute  of  International  Criminal  Court  (Article  6);  6)  The 
Criminal  Code  of  the  Azerbaijan  Republic  (Article  103);  7)  the 
Decree  of  President  of  the  Azerbaijan  Republic  “On  genocide  of 
Azerbaijanis”, dated 26 March, 1998.
III. Juridical consequences of recognition by the international 
law of Khojaly events as a crime, coming under the “genocide” legal 
standard 
In  connection  with  genocide  crime,  the  international  law 
specified: 1) Criminal prosecution and penalty of people, committed 
genocide crime is inevitable; 2) Content of a crime is not only the 
commitment of a genocide act, but also a plot aimed at committing 
genocide,  direct  and  public  instigation  to  the  commitment  of 
genocide, attempt to commit genocide and participation in genocide; 
www.avciya.az- 146 -
Khojaly genocide: million signatures – one demand
3) Principles of universal jurisdiction should be applied to people, 
committed a genocide crime; 4) Reference to execution of an order 
upon  commitment  of  a  genocide  crime  does  not  exempt  from 
liability;  5)  Leaders  account  for  non-fulfillment  of  actions  on 
prevention  of  genocide  crimes;  6)  Time  limitation  as  to  criminal 
liability is not applied to genocide crimes; 7) Retroactive application 
of the law is admitted in respect of genocide crimes; b) Persons who 
committed  a  genocide  crime  should  be  extradited  to  a  charging 
country for bringing to criminal liability. 
Thus,  the actions  committed  against  population  of Khojaly 
town  -  ethnic  Azerbaijanis  by  Armenians  are  qualified  under 
international legal documents as genocide and they are considered a 
crime against mankind as provided by principles of the intentional 
law.  Finally,  the  actions  of  Armenians  and  their  accomplices, 
participated in the Khojaly tragedy is the grave violation of human 
rights,  cynical  disdain  of  international  legal  acts  –  the  Geneva 
Convention,  the  Universal  Declaration  on  Human  Rights,  the 
International Pact on civil and political rights, the International Pact 
on economical, social and cultural rights, the Declaration on children 
rights, the Declaration on the Protection of Women and Children in 
Emergency and Armed Conflict and other acts of the international 
law. 
The Parliament of Azerbaijan declared the 26th of February 
of  every year  “The day of  Khojaly genocide”.  Azerbaijani  nation 
honour the memory of Khojaly victims every year on February 26 at 
17:00 with a minute of silence.  
Khojaly  residents  who  became  refugees  and  temporarily 
sheltered in 48 regions of Azerbaijan are waiting for just settlement 
of  the  Nagorno-Karabakh  conflict,  cessation  of  the  Armenian 
aggression against Azerbaijan and restoration of territorial integrity 
of  the  republic.  They  appeal  to  nations  of  the  world,  states,  and 
international  organizations  with  calls  to  protect  truth  and  justice, 
charge  terrorism  facts  and  ethnic  purge  committed  in  Khojaly.

Persons  guilty  of  the  Khojaly  tragedy,  its  inspirers  and  executors 
should  suffer  condign  punishment.  There  should  not  be  a  crime 
without punishment. XX century knew a number of bloody pages, 
reflecting  the history of genocide  and ethnic  purges.  The Khojaly 
tragedy  is  one  of  the  most  terrible  among  them.  The  persons 
somehow involved in this monstrous crime still account only in the 
face of their conscience, but the day will come and they will account 
answer  for  everything  before  the  court  history.

KHOJALY GENOCIDE 
AS A CRIME AGAINST HUMANITY
Today,  there  exist  various  interpretations  of  the  term 
“genocide”.  For  example,  it  is  interpreted  as  coordinated  plan  of 
different activities directed to the destruction of main strongholds of 
national  groups.  Aim  behind  this  plan  can  be  disintegration  of 
political  and social  institutes,  culture,  language,  national  thoughts, 
religion and economic existence of national groups, and also threat to 
personal  security,  liberties,  harming  health,  humiliation  of  dignity 
and physical destruction of individuals concerning those groups.
For the first time the term “genocide” (genos – family, tribe 
or race (Greek); caedere – to kill, to massacre (lat.)) related to proper 
actions was used by Polish lawyer of Jewish origin Rafael Lemkin - 
who worked at the US Defense Department.  In his works “Fascist 
control  of  occupied  Europe”  (1944)  and  “Genocide  as  a  crime 
according  to  International  Law”  (1947)  he  used  term “genocide”. 
According to Rafael L. two phases of genocide exist:
Destruction of national identity of oppressed group; 
Influencing national identity of oppressing group in coercive 
manner. 
Genocide  received  its  International  legal  status  only  after 
World  War  2  in  December  of  1948.  In  the  “Convention  on  the 
Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide” genocide is 
defined as a conception determining the most serious crime against 
humanity.  Nazis acts perpetrated in World War 2 have led to new 
forms of interpretation of the term “genocide”: “political genocide” – 
full  destruction  of  national  government;  “social  genocide”  is 
expressed in the attempts to weaken national-spiritual  strongholds, 
especially  by  attacking  intellectuals;  “cultural  genocide”  – 
prohibition of use of local language, coercive education in the spirit 
of  national-socialism,  and also tough control  of culture  in  general 
including  rude  expression  of  this  policy  in  the  form  of  burning 
www.avciya.az- 149 -
Khojaly genocide: million signatures – one demand
libraries;  “economic  genocide”  – destruction  of  national-economic 
life  manner  bases;  “biological  genocide”  –  application  of  various 
measures  on lowering the level  of birth  rates  among non-German 
population, for example separation of men from women in coercive 
manner, intentional creation of atmosphere where parents encounter 
lack of food with the purpose of decreasing life ability of children 
born from those parents and, on contrary, providing high standards 
of living for German origins by allocating funds for children born 
from German military servicemen; “physical genocide” – in the form 
of  mass  killing  of  certain  population  group  members,  also  racial 
discrimination  when  coming  to  distribution  of  food  products; 
“religious  genocide”  –  destruction  of  fundaments  of  religion  and 
teaching national-socialism instead; “moral genocide” – an attempt 
to  destruct  certain  national  group  by  spreading  alcoholism  and 
pornography among this group. 
Deep research of genocide in the frames of International Law 
as  grave  crime  against  security  of  humanity  has  found  its  real 
reflection in institutionalized form.  On these bases many principles 
and  norms  of  international  law  concerning  this  crime  occurred. 
Those  principles  and  norms  were  adopted  in  the  frames  of 
Convention  on  the  Prevention  and  Punishment  of  the  Crime  of 
Genocide of 1948 directed to the protection of national minorities. 
In the article two of this Convention genocide is determined 
as "any of the following acts committed with intent to destroy,  in 
whole or in part, a national, ethnic, racial or religious group, as such: 
a) Killing members of the group; 
b) Causing serious bodily or mental harm to members of the 
group; 
c)  Deliberately  inflicting  on  the  group  conditions  of  life, 
calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part; 
d) Imposing measures intended to prevent births within the 
group;  and  forcibly  transferring  children  of  the  group  to  another 
group."

In  the  process  of  institutionalization  such  categories  of 
genocide  as  political,  economic  and  religious  were  placed  into 
another analogous sphere of international law – “human rights”. 
Genocide acts are usually perpetrated in the period of armed 
conflicts, because during this period there exists favorable condition 
for this crime. That is why this crime was included in the statutes of 
Nuremberg trials and other following ad hoc tribunals. Particularly, 
in the article 6 of Nuremberg Trials Statute genocide is included in 
the  context  as  constructive  and affirmative  part  of  crimes  against 
humanity  perpetrated  during  the  war.  In  the  shown  article  crime 
includes  “murder,  mass  killings,  slavery,  deportation  and  other 
inhumane acts perpetrated against civilians before or during the war, 
and also haunt  on the political,  racial  or religious  ground for any 
crime  committed  that  corresponds  under  jurisdiction  of  Tribunal 
irrespective of whether national legislation of the state where a crime 
was committed is violated or not”. 
Founded  by  Order  of  National-revolutionary  Council  of 
Cambodia  on July 15 1979 National-revolutionary tribunal  on the 
investigation of Pol-pot – Yieng Sari and their supporters carried out 
investigation on the act of perpetration of genocide. In the article one 
of the upper mentioned Order genocide was determined as planned 
mass killings of civilians, banishment of population from cities and 
countries  and its  concentration  in  “communities”,  forcing  to  hard 
labor  in  the  conditions  leading  to  physical  and  physiological 
destruction  of  a  person,  destruction  of  religion,  destruction  of 
economic and cultural structures, family and public relations. 
The difference of this determination of genocide from the one 
in  1948  Convention  against  genocide  shows  that  in  the  practice 
change in conventional determination of crime is not excluded when 
it  is  implemented  into  national  law.  In  order  not  to  violate  the 
principle  of absence of back force of law, the Order  of National-
revolutionary  Council  of  Cambodia  took  into  consideration 
www.avciya.az- 151 -
Khojaly genocide: million signatures – one demand
international-legal  condition  which  has  determined  genocide  as  a 
crime before its commitment by polpotians. 
According  to  article  3  of  the  Convention  on  genocide  not 
only  genocide  demands  penal  sentence,  but  also  this  includes 
conspiracy with the purpose of commitment of genocide, direct or 
public  incitement  to  perpetrate  this  crime,  and  also  attempt  or 
common participation  in  the  crime.  Although the  act  of  genocide 
itself can be perpetrated in the territory of one state, but the upper 
mentioned criminal acts that assist the commitment of genocide can 
be perpetrated also in the territory of other states. 
Universal  jurisdiction in  relation  to  the persons accused in 
genocide  is  set  in  the  Convention.  First  of  all,  they  should  be 
examined by competent court of that state in the territory of which 
the  crime  was  committed.  Second,  to  view  a  concrete  issue  An 
International  criminal  court  with  proper  jurisdiction  can  be 
established. 
Modern genocides started not in XX century – genocide acts 
of  the  USA,  England  and  Belgium in  American  West,  India  and 
Congo in XIX century point out at their early roots. Although there 
are important  differences between the genocides of XIX and XX-
XXI centuries, all of them have one common driving force – they are 
related to imperial structure or replies to challenges of empires. The 
well known genocide acts in the world practice are the following:
Massacre  of  Jewish  (see  Holocaust)  and  gypsies  in  fascist 
Germany in the period of 1935-1945, and also massacre of civilians 
living in  the European states occupied by Germany during World 
War 2 (the European part of USSR and other Eastern European state 
nations lost more people); 
Slaughter of three million Cambodians by Pol Pot and Yieng 
Sari regimes during 1974-1979 in Cambodia; 
Genocide in Rwanda in 1994.
 
www.avciya.az- 152 -

There is an opinion that Soviet government also perpetrated 
genocide act during 1932-1933 in Ukraine when massive people died 
from starving (this opinion is not accepted by many scholars – see 
Starving in Ukraine), and also massive killings on ethnic ground and 
ethnic cleansing conducted through Armenian-Azerbaijan, Georgian-
Abkhazian,  Georgian-Osetin  conflicts,  moreover  ethnic  clash  of 
central  Asian republics (Uzbekistan, Tajikistan).  One of the recent 
examples of genocide is – massive slaughter in Rwanda as a result of 
which  representatives  of  Khutu  tribe  massacred  800  thousand 
members  of  Tutsi  tribe.  Thus,  genocide  can  have an international 
character or just like armed conflicts, it can be internal. International 
genocide was committed by American regular arms during “dirty” 
war  in  Vietnam.  Inner  state  genocide  was  perpetrated  by  “red 
kchmers” in Cambodia under the leadership of Pol Pot and Yieng 
Sari. As a result of their order in 1975-1979 3 million Cambodians or 
every third citizen died. National minorities, religious people, origins 
of  other  countries  were  slaughtered;  children  of  early  ages  were 
killed in massive order. The accused were orally sentenced to death 
penalty  according  to  norms  of  Order  of  National-revolutionary 
Council  of  Cambodia  for  genocide.  To  persons  who  committed 
genocide  expiration  date  is  not  applied.  On  November  8,  1994 
Statute of International tribunal for Rwanda was adopted. It covered 
court prosecution of persons who are responsible for genocide and 
other serious violations of international humanitarian law perpetrated 
in  the  territory  of  Rwanda  and  neighboring  countries  during  the 
period  between  January  1  1994  and  December  31  1994.  *(430) 
Persons  accused  in  genocide  were  sentenced  by  International 
Tribunal  and national  courts  of Rwanda according  to  the rules  of 
parallel jurisdiction. 
Genocide  is  recognized  as  a  crime  by international  law in 
terms  of  genocide  crime  included  in  the  list  of  acts  on  which 
International  Criminal  Court  applies  its  jurisdiction;  During Rome 
conference  this  issue  was  supported  unanimously,  however  the 
www.avciya.az- 153 -
Khojaly genocide: million signatures – one demand
contradictions  were  demonstrated  on  the  other  crimes.  Thus  in 
general Roman Statute fully expressed the determination of genocide 
given in the Convention of 1948. Although Statute project prepared 
by  Commission  on  International  Law  and  passed  to  General 
Assembly in 1994 while listing genocide among the crimes fitting 
under jurisdiction of the Court did not include its determination, later 
on during the Roman Statute preparatory work it was decided to use 
the determination of genocide given in the Convention of 1948. This 
was not rejected by anyone. Article 6 of Roman Statute determines 
genocide  as  any  of  the  following  acts  committed  with  intent  to 
destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious 
group, as such:  
(a) Killing members of the group; 
(b) Causing serious bodily or mental harm to members of the 
group; 
(c)  Deliberately  inflicting  on  the  group  conditions  of  life 
calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part; 
(e)  Forcibly  transferring  children  of  the  group  to  another 
group.  
Genocide  in  the  Penal  Code  of  Azerbaijani  Republic  is 
strictly  adapted  to  the  one  given  in  international  convention  and 
displays its meaning in fact as in text. Very briefly and concretely, 
four groups of population, against which the genocide is directed, are 
shown – national, ethnic, racial and religious. Along with this in the 
legislature  of  other  states  genocide  is  enlarged  on  the  account  of 
increase of group quantites – suffering from genocide and also has 
different  meaning.  Thus,  according  to  Penal  legislature  of  Poland 
while not using the term “genocide”, its meaning is formulated as 
following:  “an  act  intended  to  destroy  whole  or  in  part  national, 
ethnic, racial  or religious group, or murdering or harming a group 
member”.
Also there is a punishment for creation of hard conditions for 
those  groups  where  there  is  a  danger  of  biological  destruction, 
www.avciya.az- 154 -
Khojaly genocide: million signatures – one demand
deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to 
bring about its  physical  destruction in whole or in part,  imposing 
measures  intended  to  prevent  births  within  the  group,  forcibly 
transferring children of the group to another group. 
Implementation of international norms in Polish Penal Code 
is displayed as a type of transformation. However, along with this the 
Code  seriously  differs  from  international-legal  determination  of 
genocide, and it is not accepted during implementation. Except four 
groups  against  which  genocide  is  directed,  it  includes  political 
groups and groups with certain points of view. Those conceptions are 
not legal and can be interpreted differently. International Law tries to 
avoid  other  expressions  such  as  “political  crimes”  and  “political 
contents and aims”. 
Penal law passed in 1998 in the Republic of Latvia has the 
analogous  explanations.  Other  than  national,  ethnic  and  religious 
groups  who  faced  genocide  certain  social  groups  of  people  and 
groups of people of certain prejudices are recognized. This baseless 
and far from international-legal determination of genocide lets ruling 
regime members to use this against their political opponents. Thus, 
in  Latvia  criminal  cases  are  prosecuted  against  the  workers  of 
National Committee of Internal Affairs who before military period 
performed obligatory order – applied administrative exile of citizens 
beyond the borders of republic. As it is clear, those kinds of rude 
violations  of  legislature  took place  in  USSR in  the  end of  20s  – 
beginning of 30s, when thousands of people were exiled to Siberia. 
Stalin repressions were accused by XX meeting of CPSU, history, 
political science, penal law. But to count these acts as genocide is not 
legally right. 
We  should  mention  that  the  term  “genocide”  is  used  as 
political-publicist  opinion  in  press,  not  as  legal  conception  and 
international penal crime.  For example,  some right about genocide 
against Russian regime of ex-president B.N.Yeltsin or genocide of 
I.V.Stalin against repressed soviet citizens. Genocide crime here is 
www.avciya.az- 155 -
Khojaly genocide: million signatures – one demand
defined  deliberately as  whole  or  in  part  destruction  of  population 
groups.  This  kind  of  intention  is  absent  here.  But  intentional 
realization  of  Hitler’s  comprehensive  plan  of  killing  Jewish  and 
Slavic nations during world war two – is indisputable genocide. 
Today recognition of genocide fact in international scale is in 
its  turn  a  problematic  question.  In  many  cases  the  power  that  is 
accused of genocide act does not want to recognize it; the opposite 
happens  only  rarely,  and  then  often  genocide  act  is  recognized 
already  by  heirs  of  power  that  committed  it.  Often  genocide  is 
recognized only be some third states. All this leads to impunity and 
to creation of conditions for commitment of this international crime 
again. 
For many centuries Armenian “fascists” conducted policy of 
cruel terror and genocide against Azerbaijani nation. Thus, 300 years 
ago Russian emperor Peter I draw contours of future empire. Sending 
messengers to the south he ordered them: “you should try to attract 
them (Armenians) to our lands in order to make a back to Russia”.  
And beginning from the XIX century with the signing of Gulustan 
(1813)  and  Turkmenchay  (1828)  treaties  on  the  division  of 
Azerbaijani territory between Russia and Iran began realization of 
plan  on  creation  of  “Armenian  state”  in  the  territory  of  ancient 
Azerbaijan. As a result about 300 thousand Armenians living in the 
territory  of  Iran  and  Turkey  were  moved  to  Azerbaijan  and 
accommodated  in  the  territory  of  Irevan  (now  Yerevan),  Upper 
Karabakh, Nakhichevan, Zangezur, Dereleyez, Ordubad, Vedibasar. 
In spite of this number of Azerbaijanis living in these regions still 
exceeded number of Armenians. For example, in 1886 in Zangezur 
region  of  Ganja  province  out  of  326  villages  only  81  were 
Armenians. Population of Irevan region consisted of 66 percent of 
Azerbaijanis  and  34  percent  of  Armenians.  And  to  reach 
quantitatively  exceeding  number  of  Armenians  in  regard  to 
Azerbaijani  population  there  began  bloody  policy  of  genocide.  
Hundreds  of  Azerbaijani  villages  were  set  to  fire  in  Zangezur, 
www.avciya.az- 156 -
Khojaly genocide: million signatures – one demand
Irevan, Nakhichevan, Ordubad, Gazakh, Karabakh and other regions 
of Azerbaijan with the native population being ruthlessly diminished. 
On March  30 1918 after  long preparation  of  Dashnak forces  and 
Bolsheviks  under  the  leadership  of  Shaumyan  began  genocide 
against the population of Baku. Starting from March 30 till April 2 
only  in  Baku  there  were  killed  12  thousand  Azerbaijanis,  among 
them were the old, children and women. 
There  are  tens  of  documents  proving  the  fact  that 
representatives  of  Armenian  intelligence  and  Armenian  church 
participated  in  the  firing  and  profaning  of  Muslim  corpses. 
“Ismailliya” – one of the most beautiful buildings in Baku was set to 
fire. Publishing house of the newspaper “Open word” was destroyed. 
Most  of  the  population  of  Baku  left  the  city.  Its  majority  in  the 
search of secure place became refugees and had to flee to Central 
Asia  and Iran.  After  carnage in Baku menshevik newspaper  “Our 
voice” wrote: “Burnt human corpses were all around in piles”. In the 
centre of the city next to a Mosque “Teze Pir” you could watch a 
horrible picture. The Mosque seriously was damaged as a result of 
shootings. 
Crimes committed by Armenians in Baku were repeated in 
Quba, Khachmaz, Lankaran, Hajiqabul, Salyan and in a very brutal 
way in Shamakhi.  We should mention that in Shamakhi were killed 
seven thousand people, in Guba – sixteen thousand, in Lankaran and 
Astara – thousand, in Salyan and Hajiqabul – two thousand Muslim 
population.  Their  houses  were  flamed,  and  their  property  was 
confiscated. In 1918 was created Extraordinary Commission with the 
purpose of investigation of genocide committed against Azerbaijani 
nation. Russian and Jewish were the most who witnessed. All those 
comments and expressions typed in 1918-1919 are obvious proof of 
crimes accredited by Armenian bandits. 
Undeniable  fact  is  that  in  1918-1920  Dashnaks  razed  to 
ground  lands  of  hundreds  of  Azerbaijani  villages  and  countries, 
massacred  thousands  of  women,  the  old  and  children  in  Baku, 
www.avciya.az- 157 -
Khojaly genocide: million signatures – one demand
Shemakha,  Zangezur,  Surmeli,  Irevan,  Echmiadzin,  Sharur, 
Basarkecherde,  Gazakh, Ganja,  Karabakh.  During genocide out  of 
575000 Azerbaijanis living in the territory of modern Armenia were 
killed  and  exiled  565  thousand  people.  This  number  is  even 
confirmed  by  Armenian  author  Z.  Kardokyan  in  his  book.  Till 
Soviets  took  power  in  Armenia  in  November  1920,  10  thousand 
Azerbaijanis were living in this territory.  In 1922 only 60 thousand 
Azerbaijani refugees could come back to their native lands. 
Only through XX century Azerbaijani population of Armenia 
was exposed to violence 4 times by Armeian bandits and exiled from 
their native lands: 
    First stage     1905-1907 
    Second stage     1915-1920
    Third stage     1948-1953 
    Fourth stage                      1986-1988
 
In  1943  during  the  work  of  Tehran  conference  while 
discussing Soviet-Iran relations Armenian diaspora appealed to the 
minister  of  foreign  affairs  V.Molotov.  They  asked  to  move 
Armenians  from  Iran  to  USSR.  Molotov  reported  this  fact  to 
Secretary General of Communist Party I. Stalin, and received official 
permission  on  the  movement  of  Armenians.  Secretary  of  Central 
Commission of Communist Party Q.Arutyunov, taking advantage of 
this  permission  managed  the  decision  of  forced  deportation  of 
Azerbaijanis  from  Armenia  and  movement  of  Armenians  living 
abroad to Armenia. 
Council of Ministers of USSR adopted direction on “About 
moving village people of Azerbaijani origin from Armenian SSR to 
Kura-Araz region of Azerbaijani SSR”. 
During the next deportation of Azerbaijanis in 1948-1953 (by 
Stalin)  the  main  issue  that  Armenians  concentrated  on  was  the 
emptying  economically,  socially  and  morally  strong  and  strategic 
www.avciya.az- 158 -
Khojaly genocide: million signatures – one demand
zones.  Because of this on the first stage Irevan was cleaned from 
Azerbaijani  natives  and only then  the other  regional  centers  were 
emptied. 
Because a part of departed population lived in mountainous 
regions of Armenia those people could not adjust to climate changes 
of Kura-Araz plain. That’s why the people moved to Kura-Araz plain 
died in masses. 
On  the  other  side,  none  of  departed  Azerbaijanis  from 
Armenia  was allowed to move to  Mountainous  Karabakh.  On the 
contrary, planning the realization of “Great Armenia” the cleaning of 
this  territory  continued.  In  1949  under  the  pretext  of  internal 
replacement  132 (549 persons) families  were deported  to  Khanlar 
region of Azerbaijan. 
At the same time operation on the change of local area names 
of Azerbaijan was conducted,  education and cultural  centers were 
blocked  and  regions  were  merged.  In  1947-1953  names  of  60 
populated  areas  with  Azerbaijani  origins  were  changed.  And  in 
general  between  1921  and  1988  hundreds  of  areas  populated  by 
mostly Turkish origins were forced to change their names. 
The idea behind the trickery of Armenians expressed during 
deportation  was  that  during  the  process  of  deportation  of 
Azerbaijanis  from Armenia only few numbers of people were left 
their  native  lands.  The  rest  of  people  who became the  minorities 
were coercively exiled from the country on the next stage – during 
final and full cleaning of Armenian territory from Azerbaijanis. 
Starting from January 1988 Armenians began realization of 
their  policy  “Armenia  without  Turks”.  Armenian  government, 
committees “Karabakh” and “Krunk”, representatives of Echmiadzin 
church  under  the  patronage  of  USSR  perpetrated  thousands  of 
bloody actions during the exile of Azerbaijanis. 
As  a  result  of  ethnic  cleansing  185  populated  areas  were 
emptied  from Azerbaijanis,  more  than  250  thousand  Azerbaijanis 
and  18  thousand  Kurds  were  forcefully  exiled  from  their  native 
www.avciya.az- 159 -
Khojaly genocide: million signatures – one demand
lands; more than 200 Azerbaijanis were killed by Armenians. Out of 
them 49 people tried to escape from Armenian threat and died in the 
mountains  because  of  frost,  41  persons  died  as  a  result  of  cruel 
beatings,  35  persons  died  from brutal  tortures,  115  persons  were 
burnt, 16 persons were shoot, 10 people couldn’t stand the tortures 
and died from heart attack, 2 people were killed by doctors in the 
hospital and the rest were drown in the water, hung, killed by electric 
or had their heads cut off. 
But this inhumane genocide policy of Armenians didn’t stop. 
One  of  the  most  horrible  tragedies  that  Azerbaijani  nation 
encountered  in  XX  century  became  known  as  Khojaly  genocide. 
Khojaly tragedy – bloody action that  became a part  of history of 
humanity along with genocides committed in Khatin, Lidits, Oradur. 
In  the  night  from February  25  to  26th  in  1992  Armenian 
armed forces, Armenian armed forces of Mountainous Karabakh of 
Azerbaijan  with  the  direct  participation  of  366th  motor  shooting 
regiment  of  former  USSR  placed  in  Khankendy  took  the  town 
Khojaly that was located between Khankendy and Askeran and as a 
result horrible genocide policy was perpetrated against Azerbaijani 
nation.  In the early morning Khojaly inhabitants accompanied by a 
few OMON troops  came to  the  plain  not  far  from the  Armenian 
village Nakhichevanik. Here they were shot by Armenian army that 
was placed in the mountains over that plain. Azerbaijani Police fired 
in advance, but the forces were not equal and they also were shot. 
More  and  more  refugees  continued  to  flee  to  the  same  place. 
According to the eye witness Hijran Alakbarova, former inhabitant 
of  Khojaly  in  her  interview  to  the  organization  “Human  Rights 
Watch” she said: “We reached Nakhichevanik at 9 in the morning. 
There was field full of dead people.  I think there were about one 
hundred people. I didn’t try to count them. I was wounded in this 
field. Alif Hajiyev was shot here, I tried to help him. They shot me 
right  on my stomach.  I  saw where  they  shoot  from.  I  saw many

corpses in this field. They were killed just recently –the color of their 
skin didn’t change yet”. 
The journalists and investigators who came here after several 
days saw a horrible bloody carnage picture. Corpses torn apart were 
lying  everywhere  on  the  frozen  field.  Anatol  Liven  from London 
Times wrote that “on some of them, especially on the body of little 
girl were horrible wounds. Only here face survived”. 
Azerbaijani prosecutor Yusif Agayev saw gunpowder on the 
wounds and came to a conclusion that most of the victims were shot 
at a short distance: “They were shot from very close distance.  We 
came to the place where it all happened. I am the specialist and it 
was clear for me immediately”.  Besides of those people who were 
shot,  tens  of  people  died  from  frost  in  the  woods.  More  than 
thousand inhabitants  of Khojaly were taken captives;  among them 
were tens of Meskhetian Turks and refugees from Central Asia. 
Thus,  huge number of killed people as a result  of Khojaly 
genocide exceeds the number of losses during whole Mountainous 
Karabakh  war  period.  During  Khojaly  massacre  only  during  one 
night  613  civilians  were  murdered  including  63  children,  106 
women, 70 old men. Vicious atrocities were conducted only because 
of the fact that civilians of Khojaly – were Azerbaijanis. Practically, 
all  of  them were tortured  and killed  with special  ruthless:  people 
were decapitated,  their  eyes  were pricked out,  and they ripped up 
stomachs  of  pregnant  women  by  bayonets.  On  that  night  in  the 
conquest directly participated the second battalion of 366th regiment 
under  the  leadership  of  Major  Ohanyan  Seyran  Musheqovich 
(Ohanyan Seyran right now is “the Minister of Defence” of so called 
illegal regime – Upper Karabakh), third battalion of 366th regiment, 
under the leadership of Yevqeniy Nabokikh,  head of staff  of first 
battalion Chityan Valeriy Isayevich and more than 50 officers and 
warrant officers of Armenian origin serving in those regiments. (see

Part  of  the  city  population  that  tried  to  flee  from  brutal 
atrocities  was  trapped and was killed.  In  the  message  of  Russian 
human rights protection center “Memorial” it  was highlighted that 
during  four  days  200  corpses  of  Azerbaijanis  were  brought  to 
Agdam,  facts  were proved that  tens  of  corpses  were profaned.  In 
Agdam 181 corpses (130 masculine and 51 feminine, and 13 children 
corpses) went court-medical expertise. During the examination it was 
proved  that  151  people  died  from  bullet  wounds,  20  –  shrapnel 
wound,  10  people  were  killed  by  stabbing  blunt  objects.  Human 
Rights Protection Center also pointed out the fact of removal of scalp 
from alive people.          
     
From indications of witnesses of Khojaly Genocide 
Azerbaijani  children  killed  by Armenians  had  their  breasts 
unstitched and their  heart  was split.  The majority of corpses were 
split into pieces. 
Jamal  Abdoulhuseyn  Haydarov:  “on  the  distance  of  2 
kilometers from a farm near the district named Garagaya were many 
disfigured corpses  of  Azerbaijanis.  Azerbaijani  children  killed  by 
Armenians had their breasts unstitched and their heart was split. The 
majority of corpses were split into pieces.”
Shahin  Zulfugar  Haydarov:  he  saw about  80  corpses  near 
Nakhchivannik  village  (Khojaly).  Corpses  have  been  terribly 
disfigured, spoiled and decapitated. Among killed there was also a 
major of militia Alef Hajiyev, his close relatives Salimov Fakhraddin 
and Salimov Michael.
Jalil  Gumbataly Gumbatov:  in front of his eyes  his  wife – 
Firuza, son Mugan, daughter Simuzar  and daughter-in-law Sudaba 
were shot by Armenians
Kubra Adil Pashayeva: she went to the woods named Katik 
and was trapped by Armenians. In the bushes where she was hiding, 
Kubra  became  an  eye  witness  of  the  shooting  of  her  husband 
Pashayev Shura Tapdiq, and her son Pashayev Elshad Shura.  
www.avciya.az- 162 -

Khazangul Tevekkul Amirova: During occupation of Khojaly 
the  Armenian  insurgents  have  taken  her  all  family  in  hostages. 
Armenians  have  shot  her  mother  -  Raya,  her  7-year  old  sister 
Yegana, aunt Goycha, and her father Amirov Tevekkul was burnt by 
poured over gasoline. 
Zoya Ali Aliyeva: for three days she hid in the woods with 
the rest of other 150 Khojaly inhabitants. Akhmadova Dunya and her 
sister Gulkhar that hid with her died from frost.  
Kubra Alish Mustafayeva: “As soon as Armenians have taken 
us hostage, they shot at once 6 persons who were with me”
Saida Gurban Karimova: “12 people including me were taken 
hostage. Armenians killed my daughter Nazakat by brutally torturing 
her. They shoot Tapdiq, Irada, Saadet”.
Ali Agami Najafov: “Armenians, having surrounded escaping 
people, have shot on a place 30-40 persons”. 
After  news  about  slaughter  in  Khojaly  became  publicly 
known many simply refused to believe in it as till that time the world 
mass media shining the conflict, basically represented Armenians as 
a  victim  of  this  conflict,  but  not  as  aggressors.  And  still  now 
Armenians do not deny any more,  that during flight from Khojaly 
many Azerbaijani civilian inhabitants were killed. Some accuse the 
Armenian  civil  guardsmen,  as  if  they operated  autocratically.  The 
employee of the Armenian police major Valery Babayan considers, 
that the main motive of those events was personal revenge. He has 
told  to  the  American  journalist  Pol  Kuin-Judge  that  many 
participating  in  an  attack  on  Khojaly  Armenians,  "came  from 
Sumgait and other similar places ". When Armenian military leader 
Serzha Sarkisyan have asked to tell about capture Khojaly,  he has 
cautiously answered: "We prefer to not speak aloud about it ". As to 
number of victims, as he said, " much has been exaggerated ", and 
escaped Azerbaijanis  have rendered armed resistance.  However  in 
occasion of perpetrated events Sarkisyan has expressed more fairly 
and more rigidly: "But I think that the main question was absolutely 
www.avciya.az- 163 -
Khojaly genocide: million signatures – one demand
in other. Before Khojaly Azerbaijanis thought, that it is possible to 
joke with us, they thought, that Armenians are not capable to lift a 
hand on civilians. We have managed to break this stereotype. Here 
that has occurred. Also it is necessary to consider still, that among 
those boys there were the people run from Baku and Sumgait ".
Thus,  with  all  accuracy  it  is  necessary  to  qualify  Khojaly 
events as a crime of the genocide, being the international crime and 
which  should  be  accompanied  by  punishment  of  corresponding 
persons for the villainy accomplished by them!!!  This is proved by 
generally accepted international documents as following:
Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime 
of Genocide adopted by the UN General Assembly on 9 December 
1948 and came into effect on 12 January 1951 (Resolution 260 (III)). 
Statute of Nuremberg Tribunal (although in the Statute direct 
link on genocide is absent, perpetrated genocide acts are qualified as 
crimes against humanity and military crimes); 
Statute  of  International  Criminal  Tribunal  for  the  Former 
Yugoslavia (Article 4); 
Statute  of  International  Criminal  Tribunal  for  Rwanda 
(Article 1); 
Statute of International Criminal Court (Article 6); 
    And also the following inner state documents:
Penal Code of Azerbaijani Republic (Article 103); 
Order of the President of Azerbaijani Republic “On genocide 
of Azerbaijanis” March 26 1998 
    Accordingly legal consequences of recognition of Khojaly 
events by international law as the crimes falling under the rule of law 
norm “genocide” are:
Criminal  prosecution  and  punishment  of  the  people 
committed genocide crime is inevitable; 
Structure of a crime is not only commitment of genocide act, 
but also plot with the purpose of commitment of a genocide, direct 
www.avciya.az- 164 -
Khojaly genocide: million signatures – one demand
and  public  instigation  to  commitment  of  a  genocide,  attempt  at 
commitment of a genocide and partnership in a genocide; 
Principles of universal jurisdiction should be applied to the 
persons committed crimes of a genocide; 
The reference to execution of the order at commitment of a 
crime of a genocide does not relieve from the responsibility; 
Chiefs  bear  the  responsibility  for  unrealized  actions  on 
prevention of a crime of a genocide; 
To crimes of a genocide the limitation period to application 
of the criminal liability is not applied; 
It is supposed retroactive application of the law in relation to 
a crime of a genocide; 
The persons, who have made crimes of genocide, should be 
given  out  to  the  demanding  country  for  bringing  to  the  criminal 
liability. 
 
Thus, the actions accomplished against the population in the 
city of Khojaly - ethnic Azerbaijanis by Armenians, according to the 
international  legal  documents,  are  qualified  as  a  genocide  and 
according  to  principles  of  international  law  are  a  crime  against 
humanity  and punishment  of  corresponding persons  is  not  only a 
duty of Armenia, but also a duty of all World community,  for " a 
genocide, both menacing, and really existing, practically in all cases, 
if not always is a threat to peace. With genocide per se one should 
struggle with the powerful and incorporated political efforts, and in 
unusual cases also with application of military actions.

KHOJALY GENOCIDE 
AS АN INTERNATIONAL СRIMЕ
The  legal  definition  of  genocide  was  provided  for  bу the 
Convention  оп the  Prevention  and  Punishment  of  the  Crime  of 
Genocide and adopted bу the UN General Assembly оn December 9, 
1948  (resolution  number  260  (III)  as  аnу of  the  following  acts 
committed with an intent to destroy, in whole or in part,  а national, 
ethnical, racial or religious group, as such: 
- killing members of the group; 
- causing serious bodily or mental harm to members of the 
group; 
-  deliberately  inflicting  оn  the  group  conditions  of  life 
ca1culated to bring about its physica1 destruction in whole or in part; 
-  imposing  measures  intended  to  prevent  birth  within  the 
group; 
- forcibly transferring children of the group to another group. 
Special intention is а prerequisite for аn act to bе qualified as 
genocide.  This  aspect  distinguishes  genocide  from  similar 
intemationa1 crimes. Аll actions to bе qualified as genocide, must bе 
committed deliberately. Such actions cannot bе taken incidentally or 
negligently.  However,  merely  having  аn  intent  to  commit  acts, 
mentioned above, as well as general understanding of their possible 
consequences is not enough to qualify them as genocide.  What is 
required here, is revelation of the link between the specific intent of 
the  perpetrator  and  the  harmful  results  of  his/her  conduct. 
Nonetheless,  direct  and public incitement to commit genocide is а 
соmplete crime regardless of whether actual harm was caused or not. 
In Кhojaly case, the existence of the genocidal intent саn bе 
inferred, inter alia, from the fact that special traps were prepared in 
advance and then used for shooting civil Azeris, who were trying to 
escape. 
www.avciya.az- 166 -
Khojaly genocide: million signatures – one demand
The  fact  that  those  acts  were  aimed  at  the  Azeri  national 
group was also obvious. 
The analysis  of the crime of genocide shows that there are 
three major elements thereof: 
- victims of the above-mentioned violent acts must belong to 
а particular national, ethnical, racial or religious group; 
- there must bе а specific intent  (mens rea) to destroy such 
group in whole or in part; 
- any of the genocidal acts must bе actually committed (actus 
reus). 
Consequently,  genocide  саn  bе соmmitted  only  against 
certain national,  ethnical,  racial  or religious group.  Similar actions 
directed  against,  for  example,  political  or  social  group cannot  bе 
qualified as genocide. 
The concept of genocide requires the existence of  а specific 
intent regarding general consequences of an illegal deed. As а feature 
of genocide, intent includes following aspects: 
- intent must not to bе directed against one or more persons 
belonging to а certain group, but rather to the group as such. In other 
words,  the qualifying  criteria  is  not  the  victims'  personalities,  but 
their being а member of the certain group; 
- intent must bе aimed at  а group, as such.  Genocide means 
denial  to  accept  the  right  to  exist  of  entire  human  group.  То the 
contrary, killing of а human being (homicide) is characterized as а 
denial  of  the  right  to  exist  of  an  individual  being.  Consequently, 
actus  reus  (prohibited  act)  may  bе  committed  against  even  one 
person, but mens rea (intent) must bе directed against the existence 
of the entire human group; 
- intent must contain the desire to destroy а group in whole or 
in part; 
- such group must bе national, ethnical, racial or religious. 
It  is  not required that  а group bе indeed totally or partially 
destroyed,  so that  the  responsibility  for  genocide  bе infеrrеd.  For 
www.avciya.az- 167 -
Khojaly genocide: million signatures – one demand
that, it is necessary that the acts, constituting the material element of 
the crime concerned, bе committed with such intent. 
The  concept  of  extermination,  which  constitutes  а material 
element  of  genocide,  includes,  inter  alia,  killings  bу means  of 
different methods. 
The  International  Court  of  Justice  held  in  its  judgment  оn 
Barcelona Traction case that prohibiting acts of genocide constituted 
an  erga  omnes  obligation.  The  ICJ  has  considered  the  basic 
principles of the Convention оn the Prevention and Punishment of 
the Crime of Genocide as а part of the customary international law 
obligatory for аll states.
        
Legal basis for qualification of Khojaly massacre as аn 
international crime.
The following instruments must bе considered as а legal basis 
for qualifying Кhojaly massacre as an international crime. 
1.  Convention  оn  the  Prevention  and  Punishment  of  the 
Crime  of  Genocide  (саmе into  force  in  1951)  adopted  bу UN 
General  Assembly  оn  December  9,  1948  (resolution  number  260 
(III)). 
2. Statute of the Nuremberg Military Tribunal (although this 
statute  does  not  point  out  genocide  actions  directly,  these  actions 
constituting genocide are considered to bе crimes against humanity 
and war crimes); 
3.  Statute  of  the  International  Criminal  Tribunal  for  the 
Former Yugoslavia (par. 4); 
4. Statute of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda 
(par. 1); 
5. Statute of the International Criminal Court (par. 6): 
6. Criminal Code of the Republic of Azerbaijan (par. 103);

Azeris  dated  March  26,  1998.   
 
Legal consequences оf the Khojaly massacre 
at the international level.
Тhе  international  law  determines  the  following  regarding 
genocide: 
1.  Persons  who  committed  genocide  must  bе tried  and 
punished; 
2.  Not  only  perpetrators,  but  also  those  who  conspired  or 
directly  and  publicly  incited  to  commit  genocide  must  bе held 
responsible. 
3. Тhе principle of universal jurisdiction must bе applied; 
4.  Acting  in  furtherance  of  an  order  must  not  exempt  the 
perpetrator from responsibility; 
5. Superiors must bear responsibility for failure to prevent the 
acts of genocide; 
6. Statutory limitations must not bе applicable to the crime of 
genocide; 
7. With regard to genocide, the retroactive application of the 
law is allowed; 
8.  Perpetrators  must  bе either  tried  and  punished  bу the 
detaining  state  or  extradited  to  the  requesting  one.   
 
Informing the international соmmunity about the fact 
that Khojaly tragedy, as аn international crime, was а 
constituent part оf the policy оf genocide carried out bу Armenia 
against the people оf Azerbaijan.

for  Democratic  Institutes  and Human  Rights,  international  human 
rights NGO's, Azeri Diaspora. 
Thus, the acts committed bу Armenian side against the ethnic 
Azeri population of the Кhojaly city are qualified in accordance with 
the international  legal documents as genocide and  а crime against 
humanity.

More than a million of people having undergone aggressive 
policy  of  Armenia  live  under  hard  conditions  -  they  have  found 
asylum in tent stations,  houses-in-built,  luggage wagons and other 
places unavailable to live. 
State  of  Armenia  paid  no  attention  to  the  word  of 
international  world  by showing full  distrust  towards  UN Security 
Council's resolutions 822 adopted in 1993 in April on occupation of 
territories of Azerbaijan Republic by Armenian army, 853 adopted in 
June, 874 adopted in October and 884 adopted in November. 
Regular,  fundamental  and firm political  line carried out by 
state of Azerbaijan, constructive attitude of Azerbaijan Republic for 
fair settlement of Karabakh problem is known well by world states. 
Major directions for settlement of problem in a peaceful manner and 
through talks were approved and confirmed by 53 states of the world

RESOLUTION 822 (1993) 
Adopted by the Security Council at its 3205th meeting, on 30 
April 1993
  
The Security Council, 
Recalling  the  statements  of  the  President  of  the  Security 
Council of 29 January 1993 (S/25199) and of 6 April 1993 (S/25539) 
concerning the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict,
Taking note of the report of the Secretary-General dated 14

Azerbaijan,
Noting with alarm the escalation in armed hostilities and, in 
particular, the latest invasion of the Kalbadjar district of the Republic 
of Azerbaijan by local Armenian forces,
Concerned that this situation endangers peace and security in

CONFERENCE FOR SECURITY AND CO-OPERATION IN 
EUROPE 
FIRST ADDITIONAL MEETING OF THE COUNCIL 
HELSINKI 
MARCH 1992
SUMMARY OF CONCLUSIONS
     
The  Ministers  expressed  their  deep  concern  about  the 
continuing escalation of the armed conflict in and around Nagorno-
Karabakh and the resulting increased suffering and loss of life of the 
inhabitants. They held an extensive discussion of ways and means to 
end the conflict,  bearing in mind the implications for regional and 
international security which could result from its continuation and 
further extension. They called upon all parties to exercise restraint. 
The Ministers reiterated in the strongest terms the call for an 
immediate and effective cease-fire including an active commitment 
by responsible local commanders to its implementation. They issued 
an appeal for the re-establishment of conditions for confidence and 
constructive  dialogue,  including  the  cessation  of  measures  of 
economic and political constraint. 
The Ministers reviewed the ongoing action within the CSCE 
framework and endorsed in their entirety the decisions taken by the 
Committee of Senior Officials. They expressed their appreciation for 
the activities of the Chairman-in-Office of the CSCE undertaken in 
this connection and stressed their willingness to extend all possible 
assistance to him whenever it is needed. 
The Ministers welcomed the complementary efforts made by 
the  European Community  and its  member  States,  by the  member 
States of the Commonwealth of Independent States, by the members 
www.avciya.az- 187 -
Khojaly genocide: million signatures – one demand
of the North Atlantic Co-operation Council,  and, in particular,  the 
efforts made by the United Nations Secretary-General. 
They requested the Chairman-in-Office of the CSCE to keep 
in  close  contact  with  the  United  Nations  in  this  respect  and  to 
arrange for regular exchanges of information.
The Ministers agreed that the CSCE must play a major role in 
promoting a peace process relating to the conflict.  They agreed that 
the  situation  in  and  around  Nagorno-Karabakh  requires  further 
CSCE action.
The Ministers mandated the Chairman-in-Office of the CSCE 
Council of Ministers, Mr. Jiri Dienstbier, to visit the region shortly in 
order  to  contribute,  in  particular,  to  the  establishment  and 
maintenance of an effective cease-fire as well as to the establishment 
of a framework for an overall peaceful settlement. 
The  Ministers  expressed  their  firm  conviction  that  a 
conference on Nagorno-Karabakh under the auspices of the CSCE 
would provide an ongoing forum for negotiations towards a peaceful 
settlement of the crisis on the basis of the principles, commitments 
and provisions of the CSCE. The Ministers therefore requested the 
Chairman-in-Office of the CSCE Council  of Ministers  to convene 
such a conference as soon as possible. 
The Ministers furthermore agreed that this Conference, which 
will  take  place  in  Minsk,  will  have  as  participants  Armenia, 
Azerbaijan,  Belarus,  Czech  and  Slovak  Federal  Republic,  France, 
Germany,  Italy,  Russian  Federation,  Sweden,  Turkey  and  United 
States  of  America.  Elected  and other  representatives  of  Nagorno-
Karabakh will be invited to the Conference as interested parties by 
the Chairman of the Conference after  consultation with the States 
participating  at  the  Conference.  The  Chairman-in-Office  of  the 
CSCE  Council  will  appoint  the  Chairman  of  the  Conference  on 
Nagorno-Karabakh under the auspices of the CSCE. 
The  Ministers  urged  all  CSCE participating  States  and  all 
concerned  parties  to  take  all  necessary  steps  to  ensure  that 
www.avciya.az- 188 -
Khojaly genocide: million signatures – one demand
humanitarian assistance is provided to all those in need through rapid 
and  effective  means  including  safe  corridors  under  international 
control. 
The  Ministers  noted  the  commitment  of  Armenia  and 
Azerbaijan to fully support the mission of the Chairman-in-Office of 
the CSCE Council to the region as well as other actions on which the 
CSCE  Council  has  agreed  and  appeal  to  these  two  countries  to 
pursue actively this commitment to reach a lasting, peaceful solution.

INTENSIFICATION OF CSCE ACTION IN RELATION TO 
THE NAGORNO-KARABAKH CONFLICT
     
1. Deploring the continuation of the conflict and the human 
tragedy involved, the participating States welcomed the confirmation 
by the parties to the conflict of the cease-fire agreed on 12 May 1994 
through the mediation of the Russian Federation in co-operation with 
the CSCE Minsk Group.  They confirmed their commitment  to the 
relevant  resolutions  of  the  United  Nations  Security  Council  and 
welcomed the political support given by the Security Council to the 
CSCE's efforts towards a peaceful settlement of the conflict. To this 
end they called on the parties to the conflict to enter into intensified 
substantive  talks,  including  direct  contacts.  In  this  context,  they 
pledged to redouble the efforts and assistance by the CSCE. They 
strongly endorsed the mediation efforts of the CSCE Minsk Group 
and expressed appreciation for the crucial contribution of the Russian 
Federation and the efforts by other individual members of the Minsk 
Group.  They agreed  to  harmonize  these  into  a  single  coordinated 
effort within the framework of the CSCE.
www.avciya.az- 190 -
Khojaly genocide: million signatures – one demand
2. To this end, they have directed the Chairman-in-Office, in 
consultation  with  the  participating  States  and  acting  as  soon  as 
possible, to name co-chairmen of the Minsk Conference to ensure a 
common and agreed  basis  for  negotiations  and to  realize  full  co-
ordination  in  all  mediation  and  negotiation  activities.  The  co-
chairmen,  guided  in  all  of  their  negotiating  efforts  by  CSCE 
principles and an agreed mandate, will jointly chair meetings of the 
Minsk Group and jointly report to the Chairman-in-Office. They will 
regularly brief the Permanent Council on the progress of their work. 
3. As a first step in this effort, they directed the co-chairmen 
of the Minsk Conference to take immediate steps to promote, with 
the support  and  co-operation  of  the Russian  Federation  and other 
individual  members  of  the  Minsk  Group,  the  continuation  of  the 
existing cease-fire and, drawing upon the progress already achieved 
in previous mediation activities, to conduct speedy negotiations for 
the conclusion of a political agreement on the cessation of the armed 
conflict,  the  implementation  of  which  will  eliminate  major 
consequences of the conflict for all parties and permit the convening 
of the Minsk Conference. They further requested the co-chairmen of 
the Minsk Conference to continue working with the parties towards 
further implementation of confidence-building measures, particularly 
in the humanitarian field. They underlined the need for participating 
States  to  take  action,  both  individually  and  within  relevant 
international organizations, to provide humanitarian assistance to the 
people of the region with special emphasis on alleviating the plight 
of refugees.
4. They agreed that, in line with the view of the parties to the 
conflict,  the conclusion  of  the agreement  mentioned above would 
also make it possible to deploy multinational peacekeeping forces as 
an essential element for the implementation of the agreement itself. 
They  declared  their  political  will  to  provide,  with  an  appropriate 
resolution from the United Nations Security Council, a multinational 
CSCE peacekeeping  force following agreement  among the  parties 
www.avciya.az- 191 -
Khojaly genocide: million signatures – one demand
for cessation of the armed conflict. They requested the Chairman-in-
Office to develop as soon as possible a plan for the establishment, 
composition and operations of such a force, organized on the basis of 
Chapter III of the Helsinki Document 1992 and in a manner fully 
consistent with the Charter of the United Nations. To this end the 
Chairman-in-Office will be assisted by the co-chairmen of the Minsk 
Conference  and  by  the  Minsk  Group,  and  be  supported  by  the 
Secretary  General;  after  appropriate  consultations  he  will  also 
establish  a  high-level  planning  group  in  Vienna  to  make 
recommendations  on,  inter  alia,  the size and characteristics  of the 
force,  command  and  control,  logistics,  allocation  of  units  and 
resources, rules of engagement and arrangements with contributing 
States. He will seek the support of the United Nations on the basis of 
the stated United Nations readiness to provide technical advice and 
expertise.  He will  also  seek continuing  political  support  from the 
United Nations Security Council  for the possible  deployment  of a 
CSCE peacekeeping force. 
5.  On the basis  of  such preparatory work and the relevant 
provisions  of  Chapter  III  of  the  Helsinki  Document  1992,  and 
following  agreement  and  a  formal  request  by  the  parties  to  the 
Chairman-in-Office  through  the  co-chairmen  of  the  Minsk 
Conference,  the  Permanent  Council  will  take  a  decision  on  the 
establishment of the CSCE peacekeeping operation.

STATEMENT
OF THE OSCE CHAIRMAN-IN-OFFICE
     
You all know that no progress has been achieved in the last 
two years to resolve the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict and the issue of 
the territorial integrity of the Republic of Azerbaijan. I regret that the 
efforts of the Co-Chairmen of the Minsk Conference to reconcile the 
views of  the  parties  on  the  principles  for  a  settlement  have  been 
unsuccessful.  
Three principles which should form part of the settlement of 
the  Nagorno-Karabakh  conflict  were  recommended  by  the  Co-
Chairmen of the Minsk Group. These principles are supported by all 
member States of the Minsk Group. They are:
-territorial  integrity  of  the  Republic  of  Armenia  and  the 
Azerbaijan Republic;
-legal status of Nagorno-Karabakh defined in an agreement 
based on self-determination which confers on Nagorno-Karabakh the 
highest degree of self-rule within Azerbaijan;
-guaranteed  security  for  Nagorno-Karabakh  and  its  whole 
population, including mutual obligations to ensure compliance by all 
the Parties with the provisions of the settlement.
I  regret  that  one  participating  State  could  not  accept  this. 
These principles have the support of all other participating States.
This statement will be included in the Lisbon Summit documents.

peace process and its future implementation, including by providing 
all necessary assistance to the parties.
We welcome the opening of an OSCE Office in Yerevan this 
year and the decision to open a similar office in Baku.  These steps 
will enable the OSCE to strengthen our co-operation with Armenia 
and Azerbaijan.

RESOLUTION 1416 (2005)9
THE CONFLICT OVER THE NAGORNO-KARABAKH 
REGION DEALT WITH BY THE OSCE MINSK 
CONFERENCE
1.  The  Parliamentary  Assembly  regrets  that,  more  than  a 
decade  after  the  armed  hostilities  started,  the  conflict  over  the 
Nagorno-Karabakh region remains unsolved. Hundreds of thousands 
of  people  are  still  displaced  and  live  in  miserable  conditions. 
Considerable parts of the territory of Azerbaijan are still occupied by 
Armenian  forces,  and  separatist  forces  are  still  in  control  of  the 
Nagorno-Karabakh region.
2.  The  Assembly  expresses  its  concern  that  the  military 
action, and the widespread ethnic hostilities which preceded it, led to 
large-scale ethnic  expulsion and the creation of mono-ethnic areas 
which  resemble  the  terrible  concept  of  ethnic  cleansing.  The 
Assembly reaffirms that independence and secession of a regional 
territory from a state may only be achieved through a  lawful and 
peaceful process based on the democratic support of the inhabitants 
of such territory and not in the wake of an armed conflict leading to 
ethnic  expulsion  and the  de  facto  annexation  of  such  territory  to 
another state. The Assembly reiterates that the occupation of foreign 
territory  by  a  member  state  constitutes  a  grave  violation  of  that 
state’s  obligations  as  a  member  of  the  Council  of  Europe  and 
reaffirms the right of displaced persons from the area of conflict to 
return to their homes safely and with dignity. 
3. The Assembly recalls Resolutions 822 (1993), 853 (1993), 
874 (1993) and 884 (1993) of the United Nations Security Council 
and urges the parties concerned to comply with them, in particular by 
refraining from any armed hostilities  and by withdrawing military 
forces from any occupied territories. The Assembly also aligns itself 
with the demand expressed in Resolution 853 of the United Nations 
www.avciya.az- 195 -
Khojaly genocide: million signatures – one demand
Security Council and thus urges all member states to refrain from the 
supply  of  any  weapons  and  munitions  which  might  lead  to  an 
intensification  of  the  conflict  or  the  continued  occupation  of 
territory.
4. The Assembly recalls  that  both Armenia and Azerbaijan 
committed themselves upon their accession to the Council of Europe 
in January 2001 to use only peaceful means for settling the conflict, 
by refraining from any threat of using force against their neighbours. 
At the same time, Armenia committed itself to use its considerable 
influence over Nagorno-Karabakh to foster a solution to the conflict. 
The  Assembly  urges  both  governments  to  comply  with  these 
commitments and refrain from using armed forces against each other 
and from propagating military action.
5. The Assembly recalls that the Council of Ministers of the 
Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe (CSCE) agreed 
in Helsinki in March 1992 to hold a conference in Minsk in order to 
provide  a  forum for  negotiations  for  a  peaceful  settlement  of  the 
conflict. Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, the former Czech and Slovak 
Federal  Republic,  France,  Germany,  Italy,  the Russian Federation, 
Sweden, Turkey and the United States of America agreed at that time 
to participate in this conference. The Assembly calls on these states 
to  step  up  their  efforts  to  achieve  the  peaceful  resolution  of  the 
conflict  and  invites  their  national  delegations  to  the  Assembly  to 
report annually to the Assembly on the action of their government in 
this respect. For this purpose, the Assembly asks its Bureau to create 
an  ad  hoc  committee  comprising,  inter  alia,  the  heads  of  these 
national delegations.
6. The Assembly pays tribute to the tireless efforts of the co-
chairs of the Minsk Group and the Personal Representative of the 
OSCE  Chairman-in-Office,  in  particular  for  having  achieved  a 
ceasefire  in  May  1994  and  having  constantly  monitored  the 
observance of this ceasefire since then.  The Assembly calls on the 
OSCE Minsk Group co-chairs  to take immediate  steps to conduct 
www.avciya.az- 196 -
Khojaly genocide: million signatures – one demand
speedy negotiations for the conclusion of a political  agreement on 
the  cessation  of  the  armed  conflict.  The  implementation  of  this 
agreement will eliminate major consequences of the conflict for all 
parties  and  permit  the  convening  of  the  Minsk  Conference.  The 
Assembly calls on Armenia and Azerbaijan to make use of the OSCE 
Minsk  Process  and  to  put  forward  to  each  other,  via  the  Minsk 
Group, their constructive proposals for the peaceful settlement of the 
conflict  in  accordance  with  the  relevant  norms  and  principles  of 
international law.
7.  The  Assembly  recalls  that  Armenia  and  Azerbaijan  are 
signatory  parties  to  the  Charter  of  the  United  Nations  and,  in 
accordance with Article 93, paragraph 1 of the Charter, ipso facto 
parties to the statute of the International Court of Justice. Therefore, 
the Assembly suggests that if the negotiations under the auspices of 
the  co-chairs  of  the  Minsk  Group  fail,  Armenia  and  Azerbaijan 
should  consider  using  the  International  Court  of  Justice  in 
accordance with Article 36, paragraph 1 of its statute.
8. The Assembly calls on Armenia and Azerbaijan to foster 
political  reconciliation  among  themselves  by stepping  up bilateral 
inter-parliamentary co-operation within the Assembly as well as in 
other forums such as the meetings of the speakers of the parliaments 
of the Caucasian Four.  It recommends that both delegations should 
meet during each part-session of the Assembly to review progress on 
such reconciliation. 
9. The Assembly calls on the Government of Azerbaijan to 
establish  contact,  without  preconditions,  with  the  political 
representatives  of  both  communities  from  the  Nagorno-Karabakh 
region  regarding  the  future  status  of  the  region.  It  is  prepared  to 
provide facilities for such contacts in Strasbourg, recalling that it did 
so in the form of a hearing on previous occasions with Armenian 
participation.
10.  Recalling  its  Recommendation  1570  (2002)  on  the 
situation of refugees and displaced persons in Armenia, Azerbaijan 
www.avciya.az- 197 -
Khojaly genocide: million signatures – one demand
and Georgia, the Assembly calls on all member and Observer states 
to  provide  humanitarian  aid  and  assistance  to  the  hundreds  of 
thousands  of  people  displaced  as  a  consequence  of  the  armed 
hostilities  and the expulsion of ethnic Armenians from Azerbaijan 
and ethnic Azerbaijanis from Armenia.
11.  The  Assembly  condemns  any  expression  of  hatred 
portrayed in the media of Armenia and Azerbaijan.  The Assembly 
calls  on  Armenia  and  Azerbaijan  to  foster  reconciliation  and  to 
restore  confidence  and mutual  understanding  among  their  peoples 
through  schools,  universities  and  the  media.  Without  such 
reconciliation, hatred and mistrust will prevent stability in the region 
and may lead to new violence. Any sustainable settlement must be 
preceded by and embedded in such a reconciliation process. 
12.  The  Assembly  calls  on  the  Secretary  General  of  the 
Council of Europe to draw up an action plan for support to Armenia 
and Azerbaijan targeted  at  mutual  reconciliation processes,  and to 
take this  resolution into account  in deciding on action concerning 
Armenia and Azerbaijan. 
13.  The  Assembly  calls  on  the  Congress  of  Local  and 
Regional  Authorities  of  the  Council  of  Europe  to  assist  locally 
elected  representatives  of  Armenia  and Azerbaijan  in  establishing 
mutual contacts and interregional co-operation. 
14. The Assembly resolves to analyse the conflict-settlement 
mechanisms existing within the Council of Europe, in particular the 
European  Convention  for  the  Peaceful  Settlement  of  Disputes,  in 
order to provide its member states with better mechanisms for the 
peaceful settlement of bilateral conflicts as well as internal disputes 
involving  local  or  regional  territorial  communities  or  authorities 
which may endanger human rights, stability and peace. 
15.  The  Assembly  resolves  to  continue  monitoring  on  a 
regular  basis  the  evolution  of  this  conflict  towards  its  peaceful 
resolution and decides to reconsider this issue at its first part-session 
in 2006.

KHOJALY EVENTS IN WORLD MASS-MEDIA
Newsweek, 16 March 1992 
THE FACE OF A MASSACRE: By Pascal  Privat  with 
Steve Le Vine in Moscow. Azerbaijan was a charnel house again last 
week: a place of mourning refugees and dozens of mangled corpses 
dragged  to  a  makeshift  morgue  behind  the  mosque.  They  were 
ordinary Azerbaijani men, women and children of Khojaly, a small 
village in war-torn Nagorno-Karabakh overrun by Armenian forces 
on Feb. 25-26. Many were killed at close range while trying to flee; 
some  had  their  faces  mutilated,  others  were  scalped.  While  the 
victims' families mourned. 
The New York Times, March 3, 1992 
MASSACRE  BY  ARMENIANS:  Agdam,  Azerbaijan,  
March 2 (Reuters) - Fresh evidence emerged today of a massacre of 
civilians  by  Armenian  militants  in  Nagorno-Karabakh,  a 
predominantly Armenian enclave of Azerbaijan. 
Scalping Reported - Azerbaijani officials and journalists who 
flew  briefly  to  the  region  by  helicopter  brought  back  three  dead 
children with the back of their heads blown off. They said shooting 
by Armenians has prevented them from retrieving more bodies. 
"Women  and  children  have  been  scalped,"  said  Assad 
Faradshev,  an  aide  to  Nagorno-Karabakh's  Azerbaijani  Governor. 
"When we began to pick up bodies, they began firing at us." 
    The  Azerbaijani  militia  chief  in  Agdam,  Rashid 
Mammadov, said: "The bodies are lying there like flocks of sheep. 
Even the fascists did nothing like this."

Lengaigne, said she had seen two trucks filled with Azerbaijani 
bodies. 
"In the first one I counted 35, and it looked as though there 
were as many in the second," she said. "Some had their head cut off, 
and many had been burned. They were all men, and a few had been 
wearing khaki uniforms."

ARMENIAN  SOLDIERS  MASSACRE  HUNDREDS  OF 
FLEEING  FAMILIES:  By  Thomas  Goltz,  Agdam,  Azerbaijan  - 
Survivors reported that Armenian soldiers shot and bayoneted more 
than  450  Azeris,  many  of  them  women  and  children.  Hundreds, 
possibly thousands, were missing and feared dead. 
The  attackers  killed  most  of  the  soldiers  and  volunteers 
defending the women and children.  They then turned their guns on 
the  terrified  refugees.  The  few  survivors  later  described  what 
happened: “That's when the real slaughter began”, said Azer Hajiev, 
one of three soldiers to survive. “The Armenians just shot and shot. 
And  then  they  came  in  and  started  carving  up  people  with  their 
bayonets and knives” (but don’t tell that these words were said by an 
Azeri.  If  the  newspaper  took the  responsibility  to  publish  it,  it  is 
more  than  sure,  having  the  facts  that  it  took place).  “They were 
shooting, shooting, shooting”, echoed Rasia Aslanova, who arrived 
in  Agdam  with  other  women  and  children  who  made  their  way 
through Armenian lines. She said her husband, Kayun, and a son-in-
law were massacred in front of her. Her daughter was still missing. 
One boy who arrived in Agdam had an ear sliced off. The survivors 
said  2000  others,  some  of  whom  had  fled  separately,  were  still 
missing in the grueling terrain; many could perish from their wounds 
or the cold. By late yesterday, 479 deaths had been registered at the 
morgue in Agdam's morgue, and 29 bodies had been buried in the 
cemetery.  Of  the  seven  corpses  I  saw  awaiting  burial,  two  were 
children and three were women, one shot through the chest at point

blank  range.  Agdam hospital  was  a  scene  of  carnage  and  terror. 
Doctors said they had 140 patients who escaped slaughter, most with 
bullet injuries or deep stab wounds. Nor were they safe in Agdam. 
On Friday night rockets fell on the city which has a population of 
150,000, destroying several buildings and killing one person.

CORPSES  LITTER  HILLS  IN  KARABAKH  (ANATOL 
LIEVEN  COMES  UNDER  FIRE  WHILE  FLYING  TO 
INVESTIGATE  THE  MASS  KILLINGS  OF  REFUGEES  BY 
ARMENIAN TROOPS): As we swooped low over the snow-covered 
hills of Nagorno-Karabakh we saw the scattered corpses. Apparently, 
the refugees had been shot down as they ran. An Azerbaijani film of 
the places  we flew over,  shown to journalists  afterwards,  showed 
DOZENS  OF  CORPSES lying  in  various  parts  of  the  hills.  The 
Azerbaijanis claim that AS MANY AS 1000 have died in a MASS 
KILLING of  AZERBAIJANIS fleeing  from the town of  Khojaly, 
seized by Armenians last week. A further 4,000 are believed to be 
wounded, frozen to death or missing.  The civilian helicopter's  job 
was to land in the mountains and pick up bodies at sites of the mass 
killings. The civilian helicopter picked up four corpses, and it was 
during this and a previous mission that an Azerbaijani cameraman 
filmed the several dozen bodies on the hillsides. Back at the airfield 
in Agdam, we took a look at the bodies the civilian helicopter had 
picked up. Two old men a small girl were covered with blood, their 
limbs contorted by the cold and rigor mortis. They had been shot.

Reported  by  Yuri  ZARAKHOVICH/Moscow  -  While  the 
details  are  argued,  this  much  is  plain:  something  grim  and 
unconscionable  happened in  the Azerbaijani  town of Khojaly two 
weeks  ago.  So  far,  some  200  dead  Azerbaijanis,  many  of  them 
www.avciya.az- 201 -

mutilated, have been transported out of the town tucked inside the 
Armenian-dominated  enclave  of  Nagorno-Karabakh  for  burial  in 
neighboring  Azerbaijan.  The  total  number  of  deaths  -  the 
Azerbaijanis  claim 1,324 civilians  have been slaughtered,  most  of 
them women and children - is unknown. Videotapes circulated by the 
Azerbaijanis  include  images  of  defaced  civilians,  some  of  them 
scalped, others shot in the head. 
 
BBC1 Morning News,  3  March 1992. BBC reporter  was 
live on line and he claimed that he saw more than 100 bodies of 
Azeri men, women and children as well as a baby who are shot dead 
from their heads from a very short distance. 
BBC1  Morning  News,  3  March  1992. Very  disturbing 
picture has shown that many civilian corpses who were picked up 
from  mountain.  Reporter  said  he,  cameraman  and  Western 
Journalists have seen more than 100 corpses, who are men, women, 
children, massacred by Armenians. They have been shot dead from 
their heads as close as 1 meter. Picture also has shown nearly ten 
bodies (mainly women and children) are shot dead from their heads. 
Azerbaijan  claimed  that  more  than  1000  civilians  massacred  by 
Armenian forces. 
Channel 4 News, 2 March 1992. 2 French journalists have 
seen  32  corpses  of  men,  women  and children  in  civilian  clothes. 
Many of them shot dead from their  heads as close as less than 1 
meter.  Report  from Karabakhpress  -  A merciless  massacre  of  the 
civilian population of the small Azeri town of Khojaly (Population 
6000) in Karabakh, Azerbaijan, is reported to have taken place on the 
night of February 28 by the Soviet Armenian Army. Close to 1000 
people are  reported to  have been massacred.  Elderly  and children 
were not spared. Many were badly beaten and shot at close range. A 
sense  of  rage  and  helplessness  has  overwhelmed  the  Azeri

population in face of the well armed and equipped Armenian Army. 
The neighboring Azeri city of Agdam outside of the Karabakh region 
has come under heavy Armenian artillery shelling. City hospital was 
hit  and  two pregnant  women  as  well  as  a  new born  infant  were 
killed.  Azerbaijan  is  appealing  to  the  international  community  to 
condemn such barbaric and ruthless attacks on its population and its 
sovereignty. 
Boston Sunday Globe, 21 November 1993 
By Jon Auerbach Globe Correspondent - CHAKHARLI, 
Azerbaijan -- The truckloads of scared and lost children, the sobbing 
mothers,  the stench of sickness and the sea of blank faces in this 
mud-covered refugee camp obscure the deeper issue of why tens of 
thousands of Azeris have fled here.  What we see now is a systematic 
destruction of every village in their way, said one senior US official. 
It's one of the most disgusting things we've seen. It's vandalism, the 
US official said. The idea that there is an aggressive intent in a sound 
conclusion. The United Nations estimates that there are more than 1 
million refugees in Azerbaijan, roughly one seventh of the former 
Soviet  republic's  entire  population.  Thousands  who  fled  to 
neighboring  Iran  are  being  slowly  repatriated  to  refugee  camps 
already  bursting  at  the  seams.  But  because  of  the  Karabakh 
Armenians' policy of burning villages, relief organizations say there 
is no hope that the Azeris could return home anytime soon. 
The Times, 3 March 1992 
MASSACRE  UNCOVERED:  By  ANATOL  LIEVEN - 
More than sixty bodies, including those of women and children, have 
been spotted on hillsides in Nagorno-Karabakh, confirming claims 
that  Armenian  troops  massacred  Azeri  refugees.  Hundreds  are 
missing. Scattered amid the withered grass and bushes along a small 
valley  and  across  the  hillside  beyond  are  the  bodies  of  last 
Wednesday's massacre by Armenian forces of Azerbaijani refugees. 
www.avciya.az- 203 -
Khojaly genocide: million signatures – one demand
In all, 31 bodies could be counted at the scene. At least another 31 
have been taken into Agdam over the past five days. These figures 
do not include civilians reported killed when the Armenians stormed 
the Azerbaijani town of Khojaly on Tuesday night. The figures also 
do not include other as yet undiscovered bodies 
Zahid Jabarov, a survivor of the massacre, said he saw up to 
200 people shot down at the point we visited, and refugees who came 
by different routes have also told of being shot at repeatedly and of 
leaving a trail of bodies along their path. Around the bodies we saw 
were scattered possessions, clothing and personnel documents. The 
bodies  themselves  have  been  preserved  by  the  bitter  cold  which 
killed others as they hid in the hills and forest after the massacre. All 
are the bodies of ordinary people, dressed in the poor, ugly clothing 
of workers. 
Of  the  31  we  saw,  only  one  policeman  and  two  apparent 
national volunteers were wearing uniform. All the rest were civilians, 
including  eight  women  and  three  small  children.  Two  groups, 
apparently families, had fallen together, the children cradled in the 
women's arms. Several of them, including one small girl, had terrible 
head injuries: only her face was left. Survivors have told how they 
saw Armenians shooting them point blank as they lay on the ground. 
 
The Age, Melbourne, 6 March 1992 
By Helen WOMACK - Agdam, Azerbaijan,  Thursday - 
The exact number of victims is still unclear, but there can be little 
doubt that Azeri civilians were massacred by Armenian Army in the 
snowy mountains of Nagorno-Karabakh last week. 
Refugees from the enclave town of Khojaly, sheltering in the 
Azeri  border  town of  Agdam,  give  largely  consistent  accounts  of 
how Armenians attacked their homes on the night of 25 February, 
chased  those  who  fled  and  shot  them in  the  surrounding  forests. 
Yesterday, I saw 75 freshly dug graves in one cemetery in addition to 
four  mutilated  corpses  we  were  shown  in  the  mosque  when  we 
www.avciya.az- 204 -
Khojaly genocide: million signatures – one demand
arrived in Agdam late on Tuesday. I also saw women and children 
with bullet  wounds in  a  makeshift  hospital  in  a  string of  railway 
carriages. 
Khojaly, an Azeri settlement in the enclave mostly populated 
by  Armenians,  had  a  population  of  about  6000.  Mr.  Rashid 
Mammadov Commander of Police in Agdam, said only about 500 
escaped to his town. So where are the rest? Some might have taken 
prisoner,  he  said,  or  fled.  Many  bodies  were  still  lying  in  the 
mountains because the Azeris were short of helicopters to retrieve 
them. He believed more than 1000 had perished,  some of cold in 
temperatures as low as minus 10 degrees. 
When Azeris saw the Armenians with a convoy of armored 
personnel  carriers,  they  realized  they  could  not  hope  to  defend 
themselves, and fled into the forests. In the small hours, the massacre 
started.  Mr.  Nasiru,  who believes  his  wife and two children were 
taken prisoner, repeated what many other refugees have said - that 
troops of  the former  Soviet  army helped  the Armenians  to attack 
Khojaly. It is not my opinion, I saw it with my own eyes.  
The Washington Post, 28 February 1992 
Nagorno-Karabakh  Victims  Buried  in  Azerbaijani  Town: 
"Refugees  claim  hundreds  died  in  Armenian  Attack...Of  seven 
bodies seen here today,  two were children and three were women, 
one  shot  through  the  chest  at  what  appeared  to  be  close  range. 
Another  120  refugees  being  treated  at  Agdam's  hospital  include 
many with multiple stab wounds."

Armenian  Raid  Leaves  Azeris  Dead  or  Fleeing:  "...about

By Helen Womack - "Elif Kaban, a Reuter correspondent in 
Agdam, reported that after a massacre on Wednesday, Azeris were 
burying  scores  of  people  who  died  when  Armenians  overran  the 
town of  Khojaly,  the  second-biggest  Azeri  settlement  in  the area. 
'The world  is  turning  its  back  on  what's  happening  here.  We are 
dying and you are just watching, one mourner shouted at a group of 
journalists."  
The Washington Post, 3 March 1992 
Killings Rife in Nagorno-Karabakh: "Journalists in the area

Azerbaijani officials said Armenians began shooting at them when 
they sought to recover the bodies."

Bodies Mark Site of Karabakh Massacre: "A local truce was

ordinary people, dressed in the poor, ugly clothing of workers...All

The SUNDAY TIMES, 8 March 1992 
Thomas Goltz, the first to report the massacre by Armenian 
soldiers,  reports  from Agdam.  Khojaly used to  be a  barren Azeri 
town, with empty shops and treeless dirt roads. Yet it was still home 
www.avciya.az- 206 -
Khojaly genocide: million signatures – one demand
to thousands of Azeri people who, in happier times, tended fields and 
flocks of geese. Last week it was wiped off the map. 
As  sickening  reports  trickled  in  to  the  Azerbaijani  border 
town of Agdam, and the bodies piled up in the morgues, there was 
little doubt that Khojaly and the stark foothills and gullies around it 
had  been  the  site  of  the  most  terrible  massacre  since  the  Soviet 
Union broke apart. 
I was the last Westerner to visit Khojaly. That was in January 
and people were predicting their fate with grim resignation. Zumrut 
Ezoya, a mother of four on board the helicopter that ferried us into 
the town, called her community "sitting ducks, ready to get shot". 
She and her family were among the victims of the massacre by the 
Armenians on February 26. 
"The Armenians have taken all the outlying villages, one by 
one,  and  the  government  does  nothing."  Balakishi  Sakikov,  55,  a 
father of five, said. "Next they will drive us out or kill us all," said 
Dilbar,  his  wife.  The couple,  their  three sons and three daughters 
were killed in the massacre, as were many other people I had spoken 
to.
"It was close to the Armenian lines we knew we would have 
to  cross.  There  was a road,  and the first  units  of the column ran 
across then all hell broke loose. Bullets were raining down from all 
sides. we had just entered their trap." 
The Azeri defenders picked off one by one. Survivors say that 
Armenian forces then began a pitiless slaughter, firing at anything 
moved in the gullies. A video taken by an Azeri cameraman, wailing 
and crying as he filmed body after body, showed a grizzly trail of 
death leading  towards higher,  forested ground where the  villagers 
had sought refuge from the Armenians. 
"The  Armenians  just  shot  and  shot  and  shot,"  said  Omar 
Veyselov, lying in hospital in Agdam with shrapnel wounds. "I saw 
my wife and daughter fall right by me." 
www.avciya.az- 207 -

People wandered through the hospital  corridors looking for 
news  of  the  loved  ones.  Some  vented  their  fury  on  foreigners:  " 
Where is my daughter, where is my son?" wailed a mother. "Raped. 
Butchered. Lost."  
The Independent, London, 12 June 1992 
Painful Search: The gruesome extent of February's killings of 
Azeris by Armenians in the town of Khojaly is at last emerging in 
Azerbaijan - about 600 men, women and children dead. 
The State Prosecutor, Aydin Rasulov, the chief investigator 
of a 15-man team looking into what Azerbaijan calls the "Khojaly 
Massacre", said his figure of 600 people dead was a minimum on 
preliminary  findings.  A  similar  estimate  was  given  by  Elman 
Mammadov, the mayor of Khojaly. An even higher one was printed 
in the Baku newspaper Ordu in May - 479 dead people named and 
more than 200 bodies reported unidentified. This figure of nearly 700 
dead is quoted as official by Leila Yunusova, the new spokeswoman 
of the Azeri Ministry of Defense.
FranCois  Zen  Ruffinen,  head  of  delegation  of  the 
International  Red  Cross  in  Baku,  said  the  Muslim  imam  of  the 
nearby city of Agdam had reported a figure of 580 bodies received at 
his mosque from Khojaly, most of them civilians. "We did not count 
the bodies. But the figure seems reasonable. It is no fantasy," Mr. 
Zen Ruffinen said. "We have some idea since we gave the body bags 
and products to wash the dead." 
Mr. Rasulov endeavors to give an unemotional  estimate of 
the number of dead in the massacre.  "Don't get worked up. It will 
take several months to get a final figure," the 43-year-old lawyer said 
at his small office. 
Mr. Rasulov knows about these things. It took him two years 
to  reach  a  firm  conclusion  that  131  people  were  killed  and  714 
wounded when Soviet troops and tanks crushed a nationalist uprising 
in Baku in January 1990.

Officially,  184  people  have  so  far  been  certified  as  dead, 
being the number of people that could be medically examined by the 
republic's forensic department. "This is just a small percentage of the 
dead,"  said  Rafiq  Yusifov,  the  republic's  chief  forensic  scientist. 
"They were the only bodies brought to us. Remember the chaos and 
the fact that we are Muslims and have to wash and bury our dead 
within 24 hours." 
Of these 184 people, 51 were women, and 13 were children 
under 14 years old.  Gunshots killed 151 people, shrapnel killed 20 
and axes or blunt instruments killed 10. Exposure in the highland 
snows  killed  the  last  three.  Thirty-three  people  showed  signs  of 
deliberate mutilation, including ears, noses, breasts or penises cut off 
and eyes gouged out, according to Professor Yusifov's report. Those 
184 bodies examined were less than a third of those believed to have 
been killed, Mr. Rasulov said.
"There were too many bodies of dead and wounded on the 
ground to count properly: 470-500 in Khojaly, 650-700 people by the 
stream  and  the  road  and  85-100  visible  around  Nakhichevanik 
village,"  Mr.  Manafov wrote  in  a  statement  countersigned  by  the 
helicopter pilot. 
"People waved up to us for help. We saw three dead children 
and one two-year-old alive by one dead woman. The live one was 
pulling at  her arm for the mother  to get up. We tried to land but 
Armenians  started a barrage against  our helicopter  and we had to 
return." 
There has been no consolidation of the lists and figures in 
circulation because of the political upheavals of the last few months 
and the fact that nobody knows exactly who was in Khojaly at the 
time -  many inhabitants  were displaced  from other  villages  taken 
over by Armenian forces.

- Aref Sadikov sat quietly in the shade of a cafe-bar on the Caspian 
Sea esplanade of Baku and showed a line of stitches in his trousers, 
torn by an Armenian bullet as he fled the town of Khojaly just over 
three months ago, writes Hugh Pope. 
"I'm still wearing the same clothes, I don't have any others," 
the 51-year-old carpenter said, beginning his account of the Khojaly 
disaster. "I was wounded in five places, but I am lucky to be alive." 
Mr.  Sadikov  and  his  wife  were  short  of  food,  without 
electricity for more than a month, and cut off from helicopter flights 
for 12 days. They sensed the Armenian noose was tightening around 
the 2,000 to 3,000 people left in the straggling Azeri town on the 
edge of Karabakh. 
"At about 11pm a bombardment started such as we had never 
heard  before,  eight  or  nine  kinds  of  weapons,  artillery,  heavy 
machine-guns, the lot," Mr. Sadikov said. 
Soon  neighbors  were  pouring  down  the  street  from  the 
direction of the attack.  Some huddled in shelters but others started 
fleeing the town, down a hill, through a stream and through the snow 
into a forest on the other side. 
To escape, the townspeople had to reach the Azeri town of 
Agdam about 15 miles away. They thought they were going to make 
it,  until  at  about dawn they reached a bottleneck between the two 
Azeri villages of Nakhichevanik and Sadarak. 
"None of my group was hurt  up to then ...  Then we were 
spotted  by  a  car  on  the  road,  and  the  Armenian  outposts  started 
opening fire," Mr. Sadikov said. Mr. Sadikov said only 10 people 
from  his  group  of  80  made  it  through,  including  his  wife  and 
militiaman son. Seven of his immediate relations died, including his 
67-year-old elder brother. 
"I only had time to reach down and cover his face with his 
hat," he said, pulling his own big flat Turkish cap over his eyes. "We 
have never got any of the bodies back."

The first groups were lucky to have the benefit of covering 
fire.  One hero of the evacuation, Alef Hajiev, was shot dead as he 
struggled  to  change  a  magazine  while  covering  the  third  group's 
crossing, Mr. Sadikov said. 
Another hero, Elman Mammadov, the mayor of Khojaly, said 
that he and several others had spent the whole day of 26 February in 
the bushy hillside, surrounded by dead bodies as they tried to keep 
three Armenian armoured personnel carriers at bay. 
As the survivors staggered the last  mile  into Agdam, there 
was little comfort in a town from which most of the population was 
soon to flee. 
"The  night  after  we  reached  the  town  there  was  a  big 
Armenian rocket attack. Some people just kept going," Mr. Sadikov 
said. "I had to get to the hospital for treatment. I was in a bad way. 
They even found a bullet in my sock."

KHOJALY IS STILL SMOLDERING IN ASHES
Representatives of over 30 countries were handed a book at 
the IXth Eurasian summit which lasted three days in Istanbul.  The 
book  “Khojaly  genocide”  prepared  by  the  President  of  the 
Association  for  Civil  Society  Development  in  Azerbaijan  Elkhan 
Suleymanov  informs  readers  on  the  black  page  in  history  of 
humanity in documents, memoirs and reports.
The genocide perpetrated by Armenian aggressors, backed by 
the Soviet Army is nearly forgotten nowadays.  Those who support 
Armenians,  moved  from Anatolia  90  years  ago during  the  World 
War I, for some reason prefer to keep silence concerning the Khojaly 
genocide. 
* * *
The  book  by  Suleymanov  begins  with  the  following:  “In 
1992, on the night of 25 to 26 February the Armenian armed military 
troops and the separatist terror troops with the direct participation of 
the ex-Soviet Regiment № 366 dislocated in Khankandy committed 
the most terrible and awful massacre against Azerbaijani people in 
Khojaly, located between Khankandy and Askeran.  In this way the 
Khojaly genocide started”.
The survived civilians despairingly waited for their fates to be 
determined after many-hour fierce firing.  Some of them were shot 
when tried to escape, others were driven out of their houses and then 
killed.  Neither  children  nor  old  people  were  spared.  Armenians 
intended to have Khojaly as a regional center,  thus, they need no 
Azerbaijani there.
Their intention resulted in:
www.avciya.az- 212 -
Khojaly genocide: million signatures – one demand
613  (including  60  children,  106  women,  70  old  people) 
killed;
8 families totally liquidated;
25 children lost both parents;
130 children lost one parent;
487 people wounded, including 76 children;
1275 people taken prisoners;
150 people missing.
Thus, Khojaly became an Armenian town.
This  is  not  the  event  which  took  place  during  the  global 
World War and now is  covered with the dust of history.  As if  It 
happened yesterday.
Khojaly is still smoldering in ashes.
Over a million people not only from Khojaly but also from 
Karabakh and other  occupied  Azerbaijani  lands  are  struggling for 
existence  in  camps  or  in  old,  tumbledown  train  vans.  They  are 
starving, cold and in need of medicine.
And  “the  civilized”  Europe  together  with  Switzerland, 
Belgium and France still remains deaf and keeps silence concerning 
this  genocide.  Neither  confused  nor  shamed  it  closes  eyes  to  the 
committed  by  Armenians  today and  exaggerates  the  events  taken 
place 90 years ago.
1/5  part  of  the  Azerbaijani  lands  is  still  under  Armenian 
occupation.
However, if one tomorrow day Azerbaijanis rise to free their 
occupied  lands,  no  doubt,  they  will  face  Europe  pretending  as  if 
seen, heard and was aware of nothing.
Here it is – false Europe…
