ADDRESS TO THE UNINFORMED READER 
      
       On the 15 of September, 1919 V.I.Lenin in his letter to A.M.Gorky, contemplating the certain part of 
Russian intelligentsia, wrote the following: 
        "...these are only sham-intellectuals, the lackeys of capital, considering themselves to be the brain of 
the nation, but in fact they arc not brain but a shit" 
(V.I.Lenin, Complete Works, vol.51,p.48)  [3-4] 
 
      These words of V.I.Lenin can be with good reason referred to the certain part of intelligentsia, which 
by its foul tricks and historical insinuations won the ill fame for its people. 
     During the last century here in the Transcaucasus, and especially the last 35 years there is the blunt, 
unpunished and what's more - quite substantially encouraged historical plunder and (he most shameful sabbath 
of certain part of scholars, historicians and lawyers hired by them, encroaching on the sacred feelings, historic 
belonging of other Transcaucasian peoples, including Georgians and Azerbaijanians. 
     The most surprising fact is that this vile and foulest fuss is not nipped in the bud, thus as if 
unintentionally, the malignant tumour on the body of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics is given 
opportunity to grow in a geometrical progression. 
     Flirting, soothing and consoling appeals to the militant national chauvinists do not give any real results 
from the standpoint of the Lenin national policy and give the free hand to the increasing clique of crude fighters 
for the ideals of communism. What a dangerous flirt! Here we must be Lenin-like archi-principled, archi-firm 
and archi-merciless to the arrant enemies of the sovereignty of our people in the name of the well-being of 
majority of population of our country. Delay may mean death! For we have been addressed to by the General 
Secretary of our party, Presidiums of Supreme Soviets of all republics, XIX All-Union party conference, 
participants of the special meeting of the Presidium of the USSR Supreme Soviet - and it is all in vain! 
Furthermore the 1st Congress of the USSR people's deputies, the Chairman of the USSR Supreme Soviet 
M.S.Gorbachev, expressing the will of the people's deputies of the Soviet Union, reaffirmed the inadmissibility 
of national and territory delimitation and again with the same result! Who, what unbirdled and unruly group of 
extremists would be treated with such kindness and courtesy? One feels pity for the stale which is seemingly 
giving in to the powerful, influential and ramified organization of national-chauvinists and extremists in the 
country and abroad. 
      Who else, what unruly group of extremists else would have been treated in such a noble-precautionary 
way? II becomes offensive for the State as if confessing its weakness before let it be even powerful, influential 
and far- [4-5] 
flung organization of national-chauvinists and extremists both in Ihc country and abroad. 
      Time is the most honest person, people say. But will our descendants forgive us such shameful flirting 
with "elite" representatives of the most ancient nationality of the world and, according to their words, of the 
universe, who have lost their human appearance. 
     Unprecedented in history of mankind deportation and genocide of Azerbaijanians in 70 years of the 
Soviet power, when about 200 thousand of people have been beaten, driven by force from their historical 
Motherland, named Armenia at present, - keep silence, people! 
      Murdering of the Azerbaijanians in Askeran, Khankendy (now Stepanakert - A.M.) and in Baku, - 
keep silence, people! 
      Tragic and ignored aircrush with 76 Azerbaijan fellows hurrying at the call of their hearts to help 
people having suffered from the earthquake, -keep silence, people! 
       Annexing of lands in Kazakh, Nakhichevan and other Azerbaijan regions, - keep silence, people! 
       Revoking at the 1-st Congress of the people's deputies of Ihc USSR because of impertinent claims 
and wish to drag an inveterate chauvinist Z.Balayan to the Supreme Soviet, be patient, people! It should be so! 
      Although concerning the Mari ASSR the same situation according to the constitution turns out to be a 
prerogative of the RSFSR deputies. 
 5
     Of course, it is possible to make the long-suffering Azerbaijan people keep silence and to contemplate 
with humiliation these and other open insults! Well, they have got accustomed to it, resigned themselves to the 
fact that they there were divided artificially by the Chinese wall from each other with the help of Stalin and 
Mikoyan. 
     Stalin didn't want to have mighty and powerful Azerbaijan in south boundaries of the prison for 
peoples created by him. People have got accustomed to everything. To the robbery of their history, attacks at the 
language and alphabet, repressions of their best sons. It was begun with N.Narimanov, he was the first who 
dared to defend the Azerbaijan language, school and literature, he was the first to uphold the real sovereignty 
and freedom of the Caucasian republics. What has it been finished with? N. Narimanov had "promotion " to 
Moscow and for a year [5-6] 
and a half was persecuted and murdered by Stalin and an evil genius of the Azerbaijan nation - Anastas 
Ovanesovich Mikoyan. 
     Thus, people lost their great son, patriot, a real revolutionary and Lenin's comrade!!! 
      For 28 years (a whole generation!!!) Stalin on Mikoyan's instigation emasculated, destroyed all the 
best in Azerbaijan and in its nation, imparting the service obedience, slavish psychology and servile fear of 
violence. One can't help shuddering when recalls murderous actions of such executioners as Grigoryan and 
Markaryan, deputies minister of NKVD and MGB, tens and hundreds of inspectors of the Armenian nationality 
in republican administrative bodies of Azerbaijan who under conditions of complete absence of control dealt 
with the best representatives of our fathers and mothers in the torture-chambers of Stalin like Gdlyan and Ivanov 
in Uzbekistan nowadays. 
      Nation and its progressive part, in fact, were crushed, any slight attempt to tell something in support of 
history, literature or language was suppressed at once and declared to be "pantyurkism", "panturanism" or some 
other "isms". 
     But at the same time the soil was quietly and skilfully fertilized for future flourishing of ideas of 
dashnakists, gnchakists and ramkavars. Nonsense of M.Shaginyan, S.Khanzadyan and Raffi were published, it 
is true the latter was sometimes forbidden, but the things have already been done! 
      Disastrous chemistry in Sumgait - long live minister Konstandyan! 
      Aluminum plant in Kirovabad, conversion of Lenkoran into All-Union, kitchen-garden needed by 
nobody cement plant in Baku and Tauz - thanks a lot to Mikoyan ! 
     Give cotton millions at any price, let us flood the country with substitute wine - glory to their 
followers! 
     Just only think, for centuries the Caspian sea, Kura and Arax fed people with fish and caviar, only 40 
years ago residents Baku could enjoy city beaches. 
Sea oil, the factory of wool primary treatment with malignant anthrax and other incurable diseases, tens of 
harmful industries on its territory -that is the result of our ecological and economical ignorance. 
     Is not it enough to destroy nation following the long-term prescriptions of the Mikoyans, 
Konstandyans, Sitaryans, Aganbegyans and other invisible [6-7] 
armchair strategists settled down in the State machineries - CPSU central Committee, USSR Soviet of 
Ministers, Ministry of Trade, State plan, KGB, MVD, USSR Procurators office, etc. 
      However, if it goes on like this not only the Transcaucasian people but also the people of Stavropol, 
Krasnodar, the North Caucasus and some other regions in the nearest future will understand with whom they are 
dealing. 
     One should be very grateful to the policy of the perestroika (renewal) and glasnost (openness), as only 
it could reveal the inner essence of a definite part of national-chauvinism bacillus vehicles and their protectors. 
But in order to realize and to appreciate to the full treacherous, splitting actions of this parasitizing group, it is 
necessary to show the most characteristic and instructive examples to a reader. 
      The pride of the Azerbaijan nation - Musa Galakendli, well-known in the historical science as Moisei 
Galakatuisky - has written "The History of Albania ", where he described life, manner of life and culture of the 
Azerbaijan nation. 
     It occurred that these annals fell into hands of the Armenian scribes. Having made a clean copy of this 
historical masterpiece in their own way and destroyed the original, at present they are proud of new-appeared 
writer MOVSES KALANKATUATSI and his work "The History of Aluank country" (?!). 
    Unfortunately, exposing articles concerning this unprecedented compilation of the Armenian historians 
by a famous scientist Voroshil Levonovich Gukasyan have been left on the book-shelves of the Academy pf 
Sciences, the Azerbaijan SSR. 
    But to plagiarism we shall return again later on. Rough distortion of great poet Pushkin, who wrote the 
poem "Tatsit" in 1828, plagiarism of Nekrasov, Zhemchuzhnikov (Kozma Prutkov) and many other Russian 
writers and poets became a system in th'eir actions, whatever attempts haven't been made by sadly famous 
 6
Patkanyan and his pupil Marr to cast aspersions on outstanding Rustaveli and his immortal work "A Knight in 
Panther's Skin (Tiger's skin - A.M.) 
     In 1912 Marr, Patkanyan's worthy pupil in his lecture in Baku came to the point that Rustaveli was not 
a Georgian but of another nationality. Well my dear reader, this is so. And about it you will know later.[7-8] 
      Meanwhile, in Erevan in 1968 the book was published (first in Armenian, then in Russian - A.M.) by 
a hereditary dashnak Vermishev (read Vermish'yan) entitled "Amirspasalar ". The leading idea of the novel was 
the fact that the Georgians had never their independence and if they had, then only thanks to them - the 
Armenians. The pride of the Georgian nation - tsaritsa Tamara was described as a heavy fornicatress, who was 
used by the Armenians and taking an advantage of this they ruled and defended Georgia from enemies. 
      Before publishing this pasquinade was an article by Mikael Shatiryan in newspaper "Grakan Tert" 
entitled "A valuable novel about the friendship of peoples". All Georgian publicist indignation was expressed in 
the article by Revaz Dzhaparidze "What destroys friendship of peoples", where the author based on the 
historical facts, unmasked all falsity of the next trick of the Armenian writers. And it was not just an answer to 
the slanderers, but it reflected POSITION OF THE GEORGIAN INTELLIGENTSIA, ALL GEORGIAN 
PEopLE.. 
     Speaking about calumniation and insidiousness of the author and his supporters, Revaz Dzhaparidze 
wrote: 
     "Up to now it was known that a man can steal from a man a thing or an article but to steal with 
impudence from a whole nation their history and to appropriate it is an unheard business! And where is it taking 
place ?! Before our eyes - in the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics". 
(Literaturnaya Gruziya, 1970, No.2) 
     While the indignant public of Georgia and Azerbaijan was discussing such an open impudence, 
Anastas Ovanesovich Mikoyan was busy in decoration of the most monumental building called "The Armenian 
lobby" of Moscow. 
    At the same time, a group of history falsifiers wrote for him the next history forgery "By the road of 
struggle" published in Moscow in 1970, where the authors in every possible way tried to screen him, the former 
dashnak, active assistant of such murderers as Amazasp, Dro, Andranik and Nzhde. 
    To speak the truth, they failed to rehabilitate his Gapon role in Ihc tragic death of 26 Baku commissars. 
But the main thing has been done. The rest is  being completed by his son, Sergei Mikoyan, who does his best to 
prove the innocence of his father - Stalin's and Beriya's accomplice. Well, Sergei's [8-9] 
actions can be understood, but not justified. I think that time and only lime will set everything in its own 
place. 
     With the aim of spiritual impoverishment of the Azerbaijan nation as early as the 20-s some circles 
look the steps of nationalistic character. Later in 30-50-s these steps were turned into successfully pursued 
policy on a large scale. The loss of alphabet, national traditions, language and history of the Azerbaijan nation 
was the main task of nationalists - chameleons in order to extol their nationalistic ambitions. 
    The history has kept for descendants the position in this question of Nariman Narimanov, Lenin's 
comrade, a Bolshevik and patriot. 
    "Recently some officials in Azerbaijan write for the press on the question of decreasing a number of the 
Azerbaijan lessons at school or reducing a number of plays at the Azerbaijan theatre, etc. If these proposals are 
based on the Marxist point of view, then it says the following: the more unconscious and ignorant the working 
people are, the more difficult it is to make them unite and protest against their oppressors. 
    But one can object: at present the workers work for themselves but not for the bosses - capitalists, so 
the oppressors cannot be mentioned. To this we must answer again from the marxist point of view. 
     "The more conscious the workers are, the more productive their work is, the more stable is the power 
which they seized into their hands ". If it is so, what does a real life in Azerbaijan show? In whose hands is the 
power in Azerbaijan? In the hands of workers and the poorest peasants. 
     Two-thirds of the poorest peasants and workers'- the Azerbaijanians are illiterate, oppressed, 
inconspicuous and ignorant, one-third-other nationalities: the Russians, Jews who are higher in their education 
and in culture, in general. 
   With such proportion of manpower being the State foundation, every clever, convinced Marxist must 
think so: as far as there is such difference in the preparedness for the state activities between the Azerbaijan 
working people and those of different nationalities, we cannot be responsible for power durability of these 
working people. 
   "Workers of the world, unite! " - it is not just a sound, it is not a call to unite because of private material 
profits. THESE WORDS MAKE A PROFOUND SENSE, THEY CALL FOR THE SPIRITUAL UNITING AS 
[9-10] 
WELL. THEY INCLUDE AND SETTLE THAT DAMNED NATIONAL QUESTION WHICH IS 
UNSOLVABLE WITH ANOTHER STATEMENT. 
 7
     And that who does not want to understand it he does not want to act following Marx. 
     He just says like that: you arc a miserable, oppressed, benighted Azerbaijan peasant and worker, 
remain still in the same position, as I live a well-to-do-life due to it. 
    Just the same Nickolas thought with his officials. They say, that it is necessary to place the theatre 3 
times a week at the disposal of the Russian drama and three times - Azerbaijan drama. But who needs this 
theatre most of all? For 30 years of Azerbaijan drama existence only now, for 2 years of the Soviet power in 
Azerbaijan there are three actresses - the Azerbaijanians. For 30 years only now one can see women at the 
theatre sitting in the stalls side by side with men. 
    Some others offer to reduce a number of Azerbaijan lessons at schools. In what language are you going 
to bring the children of Turkish workers and peasants together with the children of other nationalities ? 
Marx wouldn't be Marx if he weren't a psychologist. Where is our psychology ? 
   "And here dot your "i" and say: "I like the Russian language, everything in Russian is easier and clear, 
Pushkin's nice poems have been written in this language. I want the Azerbaijan children know this". The 
Azerbaijan children must know the poems not only by Pushkin, but Shakespeare and Shiller as well, but after 
they learn, first of all, menacing, fighting poems by really proletariat poet Sabir, national poets Vagif, Vidadi 
and Zakir. And it would be quite right, according to Marx. 
    If it is spoken in favor of the cause, I should offer to the author of reducing in the Azerbaijan lessons 
not to cut them down but to learn this language himself to have a chance of understanding the prophet poems of 
Azerbaijanian Sabir, as I state: in Russian proletariat literature he won't find such a poet who would describe so 
vividly all the sufferings of working class and peasantry under the yoke of a boss and a landlord. And it was 
written by Sabir during terrible reaction years. 
   Will he be surprised after this when another official asks, what for to erect monument to some Sabir at 
such a difficult time? [10-11] 
   There are no two ways about it: either these comrades don't know the Azerbaijan conditions and make 
mistakes or they learned Marx not well and cannot make out in those questions on which Marx wrote long ago. 
In this case let them read attentively "The National question" by comrade Lenin who dwells in details on the 
problem of nationality and self-determination of peoples. 
   And because of lack of knowledge concerning Azerbaijan and inability to understand these problems the 
cause of our revolution suffers. 
   Such approach to the question demoralizes party, corrupt workers, creates hostility between workers and 
peasants and thus towards the government. 
   And indeed, has a Russian worker turned upside-down Russia to continue politics? No and no! 
   A Russian worker has liberated the outlying districts quite sincerely and intentionally to give them a 
chance to liberate freely and live for a long time, but, unfortunately, among us there are representatives of the 
working class, the so called chauvinistic elements, who are not different at all in their actions from 
semenovekhovs. 
    Let them console themselves that "uniting of Russian lands" takes place. But communists must say: We 
unite not Russian lands but workers of all nationalities into a single conscious force for consolidation of their 
power. But to create a solid conscious force it is necessary to.prepare, to raise more backward part of this force 
up to the definite level of knowledge and progress. With this end in view 2/3 of money must be spent for 
literacy and in general, for education of the Azerbaijanians, 2/3 of party attention must be paid to the 
Azerbaijanians and 2/3 of the energy of all the Soviet government bodies must be given to work among the 
Azerbaijanians. 
   Those, for whom the gains of our revolution are dear, who loves Azerbaijan with all their heart, who 
values the behest "workers of the world, unite" - must act following this program. 
   But to those "birds of passage", who speak sweet words to hold their places, if not today then tomorrow 
we shall be able to tell that' the Azerbaijan and Russian workers and peasants won't appreciate our works and 
will tell their last word. At last, one can approach this question from the legal point of view as well.[11-12] 
    THE TURKISH LANGUAGE HAS BEEN ANNOUNCED TO BE A STATE LANGUAGE IN 
AZERBAIJAN AND IT MUST ENJOY ALL RIGHTS AND ADVANTAGES OF THIS LANGUAGE. 
NOBODY IS ABLE AND WILL DARE TO ANNUL IT. Azerbaijan due to some political and economical 
considerations can sede the territory, its natural resources but to abandon its native language it cannot and will 
not allow anybody to diminish the importance of this language in Azerbaijan. 
   Let those comrades know it, who under various sauces are against the Turkish language in Azerbaijan. 
(Newspaper "Bakinsky rabochy", No. 130, page J, 1922, "Answer to some comrades") 
    But now let us listen to humanist of the Georgian nation Chavchavadze, who with his well-known in 
Russia work "The Armenian scientists and screaming stones" attracted attention of all progressive public. 
    "I am not so much afraid of an undisguised enemy, as the enemy pretending to be a friend, I am afraid 
of his kindness, his smile".

Rustaveli. 
   You can hardly find in the whole terrestrial globe a nation, which was so humiliated, defamed by 
anybody who feels like it, as ours. Everybody tries either to overstep us, or trample down and to level us with 
the ground. They try to destroy even mentioning us in the Transcaucasus, to wipe off the earth a Georgian's 
name and to put up down the wirfd. As if we have never existed, as if we don't live at present. Spiritual beggars, 
weak-minded, morally fallen, uneducated, unlearned, ruined to the full, unreliable, cowards -such is picture of 
our moral and physical reserves! What have we been and what we are, according to the words of those, whose 
interests require our infamy and humiliation. They lay themselves to assure everyone, at home and outside, 
orally and in press that we were worthless and mean and remained the same, if not worse. With such a mark on 
the brow they have sent the Georgian's name throughout the Europe, wherever their voice and pen could reach. 
The same fame about us, the Georgians, they sent throughout the Russia It is true that everybody of the Russians 
or Europeans who could get acquainted personally with our good and evil sides, told something in our favor - 
but unfortunately, among them there were many, whose opinions were based on some other's longing, they [12-
13] 
danced to somebody's tune, they fell into a foreign net. Forget about them and their wish to defame us!Bul 
the fact is, they swear to the world with a word and a pen that from time immemorial on this side of the 
Caucasus range, to the Tigris and Efrat sources, almost from the Black and Caspian seas there was so called 
Armenia (Somkhetia, i.e. the country of somekhs-gaikans) and if somewhere there were sonic vratzi (it is 
Armenian name of the Georgians) they occupied the space not more that of ten catlle-sheds, and only at the 
mercy of the Armenians. These vratzi as a nation are not worth of mentioning, as they are at the stage of 
destruction and degeneration and if this were not the case, they have no so much intellect to go deep into their 
position. The god hasn't given them an ability for trade, they are fit for nothing and cannot use even those few 
places for catlle-sheds, which, it is funny to say, are called Georgia. To use them they have neither skill, nor 
diligence, nor education, nor knowledge, nor wish, nor desire to know and learn from the same ARMENIANS 
who are called by the God and history to revive and to make happy not only the neighboring East but the 
remote, wild and ignorant ASIA as well. 
    The fact that they dishonor our name and deprive us of our nationality didn't satisfy them and in order 
to worry us to death they abolish all our history, annals, historical relics and monuments, all our great services 
for the Christianity and all our historical property belonging to us they appropriate to themselves by means of 
various swindles. It is true, "lies have short legs" and taking away or depreciating somebody's merits one cannot 
increase theirs. But the slaves of their longings are hard of hearing and have bitter tongue, as a Georgian proverb 
says. 
   For what has such cloud of dust been raised, for what arc the alleged lightings and thunders? For the 
reason to persuade the world that in the Transcaucasus ONLY ONE ARMENIAN NATION EXISTS SINCE 
OLD TIMES AND THE FUTURE BELONGS IT, AS IT HAS PROVED HISTORICALLY ITS MORAL 
AND PHYSICAL FORCE, STABILITY AND GRANDEUR OF ITS INTELLECT. [AZ-Q] 
 
    Whose are all these tricks? What black raven is circling and croaking over our heads? We have said 
before and are repealing now:God forbid, we don't blame all the Armenian people, we don't attribute the whole 
sin to them, as it is the fault only of some known group of Armenians and their scribes -scholars scientists. 
However, in spite of this fact, before wc made our minds [13-14] 
to take up the pen, we had thought a lot about one and a very important for us circumstance: how will the    
Armenians treat our work? This question, as we shall see later, isn't idle. 
    Nation as an association of human beings, united by history into one body and a single soul of the given 
country in any case, must be respected by every noble and sensible person, but his insult and humiliation - an 
action is very indecent. Every nation has its own look, own aspirations, own wishes and own peculiarities. The 
defamation of all this is a roughness that is not decent for any educated man. We understand it quite well and 
God forbid to blame all the people in cases when only notorious group must be blamed. Meanwhile, just on this 
basis an attack at us is being expected. God knows what alarm will be raised concerning these assays by the 
above mentioned group, which has a habit to attach all the Armenians to the words pronounced only about 
them. The intention is clear. The struggle in defence of people and justice, deserves respect and is quite rightful. 
Our friends understand this and know well that under the banner of people's defence they will attract the general 
inclination and half victory will be in their hands in advance: " A trick is better than force." If they will easily 
accuse the explores of mean wish to spread discord between two nations, their design is right. The arrow having 
been sent to them they thrust into the people's heart to embitter them and by this clever device they cover 
themselves like a safe shield and stop mouths of the exposers of their sins. The Armenian people are not to be 
blamed; as peaceful, hard-working people they are, occupied with their own business - trade or agriculture - 
they don't put such questions and therefore they aren't responsible for the sins of their unbidden protectors 
circling above them as midges above an oak. People, in general, understand well that a true virtue needs no 
 9
trumpets and kettle-drums, they know perfectly that noise and row of unbidden shouters do not glorify their 
valour and cannot give rise to valours, in case when they are absent. A real valorous is modest and silent. And 
the more silent and modest it is, the more majestic and fascinating. 
    We have nothing against Armenians' glorification. In such cases even too much salt is only that 
generosity, which brings nobody either pain or offense, either warmth or cold. We envy no virtues or valour of 
Armenians -on the contrary, these merits arc desirable for ourselves. They are the object of competition but not 
of envy. Envy is angry and suffers from somebody's [14-15] 
incomes and success but competition is a noble feeling, it strives for virtues of others. Envy can't stand 
somebody's merits the competition, on the contrary, cant date upon them.                                                                   
   It is high time to unmask this group of Armenians. It is high time to look at them straight, in their true 
colours. It is time to find out from where a black raven croaks over us, from where it comes this hall of stones 
beating us! It is time to collect ourselves and not to show our cowardice before these pseudoliberals, before 
these harlequins of real liberalism who stop our mouths to hide their mountebanking, double-facedness and 
heartlessness under the sacred cloak of love to the people. Don't betray our tricks or we'll accuse you of 
spreading the national discord at the end of XIX century. Only small children can be frightened with these 
alleged thunders and lightning of pseudoliberalism and those who used to believe only words ignoring their 
meaning. Does liberalism consist of concealing the truth, slurring over various tricks, mountebankcry, forgery, 
deception and all kinds of other immorality but not of unmasking all this? Isn't revealing and exposure of any 
secret or undisguised evil a sacred and the primary property of real liberalism, gained by mankind at the price of 
great victims and sometimes bloodshed. 
    If we are frightened with the approaching discord and for the sake of liberalism we are silenced and if 
an irrelevant reference to the liberalism is not a mere trick to entice and frighten half - educated fellows then for 
the sake of the same liberalism, why do not stop mouth of that Armenian group the scientists, scholars and 
scribes of whom, in season and out of season, all over the world defame the whole Georgian nation, - yes, the 
whole nation and dig a grave for it? Well, has anybody of these pseudoliberals said: "What rot you are talking, 
sirs! If only you have some dignity, your own homeland, then talk about this! Why have you stuck to the whole 
Georgian nation, why do you defame it and appropriate that doesn't belong you? Will the paradise doors open in 
front of you if you abuse the Georgian nation and ruin it? Don't you know that the truth can't be concealed and 
sooner or later it will be revealed. 
   Why must we keep silence? Can it be because of the fact that everything said by us will displease the 
Armenians but the spreading of discord is a mean action at present? Must we really be afraid of these cock-and-
bull stories and won't we unite in defence of our self-esteem? [15-16] 
 
   "We lake offence of a flick but you won't dare feel hurt when we are striking with a cudgel". Liberalism 
is out of question when our dignity and all our existence are humiliated and eradicated to such an extent. 
   These tales are only playing into contemptible coward's hands, only a coward licks somebody else's spat 
in silence, without a single word he lakes scolding. Thank God, we haven't come to such state, we have kept so 
much dignity in ourselves, out heart is beating so fast that we can defend and guard ourselves and we'll let 
nobody scorn and insult the Georgian's name. 
   The tricks of Armenian scientists and their minions is an old song: 60 long years, if not more, have 
passed since that time, (to ignore) at any rale. We say 60 long years and it is not such a short period of time to 
ignore it. For long 60 years they have been raging the same thunders and lightning. The same tendencies have 
been wounding our self-esteem and every day with greater and greater impudence, boldness and daring they 
have been flaying our skin and threatening with deluge. In the course of this rather long period of time it is one 
of the same behest systematically, steadily, firmly, cunningly and with a surprising persistence one and the same 
thread runs, one can't say that very skilfully, but with great slyness and hypocrisy. In this case it is even more 
surprising that this 60 years' period is begun by a Russian writer and is finished also by a Russian writer. 
Between them there is a number of Armenian scholars-scribes, thus if to extend one thread from the beginning 
to the end, it will touch to everybody - to such extent they together propagate one and the same opinions, as if 
they make one soul and body and arc molded into one form. 
   Russian writer Senkovsky, well-known under the pen-name Brambeus wrote as early as 1838: "...before 
Vakhtang VI - the Georgians had no chronicle, the Georgians themselves didn'l exist before the XII century 
A.D. under the name of ivers different mountainous tribes were known, all country behind the Kura-rivcr, where 
there is Tiflis at present, and greater part of Georgia belonged to the Armenians from time immemorial, the 
Armenians, Midyanes, Massagets or Turks and some generations of the Albanians lived there". 
(The library for reading, 1838, p. 151-178. The tellers "Some doubts concerning Georgia 
history"). 
    Whom should we ascribe composition of such false, distorted history and geography. Without doubl it 
has been written by Senkovsky but there is no [16-17] 
 10
question that he was led into error and he only repeated the heard as an echo. It is clear that he couldn't 
read the lie like this, as in the whole world there were no chronicles where one could find such things and even 
in legends he would not find this lie. Who needs spreading news throughout the world lhat the Georgians didn't 
even exist before the XII century, that there were no Georgians in Georgia and Armenians together with some 
other nations inhabited there or that a greater part of Georgia together with Tiflis belonged to the Armenians 
from time immemorial! A lie and such unexpected one that could not appear without an ulterior motive. 
    From the day of Georgia joining Russia to the day when Senkovsky cooked up his lie only 37 years 
have passed. Is it possible that during this period of time the history became shrouded in such gloom that 
nobody remembered what country joined Russia-Georgia or Armenia and whose residence and capital was 
Tiflis? Senkovsky himself was a professor of oriental languages, a Russian writer and journalist and it is 
possible to admit that he really doesn't know the events happened lately? Is it possible to believe that Senkovsky 
hasn't heard even such historical thing important  for Russia? Didn'l he hear what country and from whom 
Russia had accepted under its protection? If it is the case, what made him compose such  incomprehensible 
history and geography mentioned above? It is clear that neither love nor passion for research influenced on him, 
as there is a down-right lie here, but a man loving science yields to no passion for a lie and won't let himself be 
carried away by it. It is clear, this strange riddle can't be explained by the thirst for research either as such 
history or geography isn't research but a bare-faced fiction, as the researcher could find no data for this. It is 
clear that neither a Georgian nor a Russian could do such a bad turn for him. What's the use for a Russian to 
spread rumours that the ,     country accepted from the Georgians had belonged to the Armenians. ... In whose 
interests were these actions? In order to find a secret origin of this deliberately invented history and to find out 
at whose will these arrows are thrown, one should investigate, in whose hands the bow is. Since that lime up to 
nowadays the Armenian scientists make every effort and try to do their best to show Georgia to the world from 
the worst side in order to cut from it and appropriate as much as possible, to destroy its past and lo defile even 
its present as far as possible.[17-18] 
 
 
    Despite all this, the Armenian historians harp on the same string and settle down in those places where 
they had never lived. Isn't it clear that by this superficial erudition they try to persuade the world in their 
historical right to occupy these places... We started the conversation about this not for the reason to think our 
opinion on this subject to be indisputable. Perhaps, the Armenian scientists' dreams were day-dreams and may 
be those countries really belonged them. We should like only to note with what skill and slyness the Armenian 
scribes adhere to their ideas. In these cases they don't disdain to use any means, attributing everything to 
themselves and concealing somebody's. 
   If you reread all the Erilsovs, Khudabashovs, Emins, ct al., you will see that they appreciate their 
opinions and investigations in gold but somebody's is not worth a button, if that doesn't pay their purpose. 
That group of Armenians, whose first singers arc their scribes, is not satisfied with these garblings, for it 
is too little to conceal somebody's truth and claim their lie to be truth. They understand well, the fact cannot be 
concealed, however you try, sooner or later, it will be discovered. The question is to destruct facts: cither to 
wipe off or scrape out historical inscription or change it in their favor. 
    That the Armenian scribes-scholars are performing and guilty of such tricks, it is also clear. And as the 
time is coming when the historical relics and monuments will tell us - who occupied and occupies these places 
at present and as the stones, numerous buildings, monasteries and temples yell that the Georgians inhabited 
these places - it goes without saying that it is necessary to make these true witnesses keep silence not to give 
them a chance to utter a word, with this aim in mind they have destroyed every trace wherever they could. 
    The trick is not very puzzling, you must have only wish and pliable conscience for it. We have such 
times at present, when one stops at nothing to achieve the end - whether it is attained by the way of deception, 
falsification or forgeries - it doesn't matter. We have many examples of the fact, when the Armenians tried to 
wipe out and to destroy the signs of Georgian descent on the Georgians temples and monasteries, to scrape out 
or wipe the Georgian inscriptions off the stone, to take the stones out of buildings and to mount new ones with 
the Armenian inscription, about this even Russian and Georgian newspapers wrote. By the way, the late 
D.Bakradzc told the fol- [18-19] 
lowing story. In Artvin there is a very old church. The local Armenians conceived a wish to appropriate 
this temple (sec D. Bakradzc "Archaeological travelling through Guriya and Adzhariya, p. 41). But local Greeks 
began to dispute their rights, on the ground that for a long time it belonged to the Georgians, they, as orthodox 
believers, had some advantage over you. The stone with Georgian inscription was mounted into it but as it 
proved the belonging of the temple to Georgians, then the Armenians decided to hide this stone. 
   Thus, having snatched this church out of orthodox believers' hands, Armenians appropriated it. Will 
such trick come into mind of ordinary Armenians? Even if it were the acts of an ordinary Armenian, then the 
 11
thought perhaps, would have been suggested by scholars and scientists. Therefore we have every reason to 
attribute this and similar tricks only to this group of Armenians, but not the whole nation. 
    Below we shall give examples of the fact that Armenian scribes are not ashamed of such tricks and that 
to erase and change documents is their profession. For the present we shall tell you that they are not content 
with eradication in this manner of a Georgian's name in the Transcaucasus and alteration of the Georgian 
historical monuments into Armenian. Besides temples, monasteries and stones in the Transcaucasus there arc 
also some other witnesses speaking about the Georgians. They are the annals and the chronicles investigated by 
scientists and they are on the watch as historical data in case if the Armenians make efforts to hatch their 
chickens in the eagles' nests. The Armenian scribes understand well that if these data are not destroyed, they 
will not be able to appropriate anything in Georgia. So they have come up to us just on that score. Their late 
professor Patkanov (sec D.Bakradzc "Professor Patkanov and the Georgian historical sources") protested against 
us with a store of erudition and almost shook our souls out of us. To start with he cancelled our "Kartlis-
Tskhovreba" (a large chronicle of Georgians' life). It has been composed, he says, in Vakhtang's VI times and 
there is no information on the existence of "Kartlis-Tskhovreba" before him. The only work of this kind, the so-
called "The Armenian chronicle", is known and if there are some materials on the history of Georgia then they 
can be found only there. It is true , he says, this chronicle was translated from Georgian but, perhaps, the 
original has been composed or compiled by an ignorant Armenian in the XII century, when the Georgians felt 
the [19-20] 
necessity for history. That is where Senkovsky reported himself and where the tendency penetrated, 
familiar to us. Thus, according to Patkanov's opinion, the Georgians before the XII century were so ignorant that 
not only had no history but even did not feel any necessity for it - and here an Armenian came to their assistance 
again and besides an ignorant one! How much ignorant we, the Georgians, had to be that an ignorant Armenian 
realized the requirement of our history, but we had no even consciousness for it. Oh, the miserable Georgians! 
May this ignorant Armenian's memory live long! 
     So he abuses us, wipes us, Georgians, off the earth - and the Georgians of what times? Of the XII 
century, the century of Tamara, the golden age of Georgia. And who does? A professor and a man of science! It 
is true , he is an Armenian professor, an Armenian scientist, but is it possible that only because of this he must 
neither speak nor see the truth? Why does he screw his eyes up purposely and does not see the Georgians of the 
XII and XI centuries, i.e. those people, who from the time immemorial covered all their country by temples and 
monasteries of a striking architecture, those people who filled both Georgia, Greece and Palestine with treasures 
and manuscripts, those people, who translated the Sanscrit story written in the Pakhlavi language "Kilila and 
Mana" and "Vis-Ramiani", created a great poem "Vepkhvis-Tkaosani" ("Panther's skin"), apart from some other 
things. He who can understand the meaning of the read, will never dare to say that the people who created 
"Vepkhvis-Tkaosani", were so wild and brute that didn't realize the requirement for history? Into whose head 
will it come to express such thought but the Armenian philosophers and professors! A Georgian proverb - 
"What a fox thinks about when it is awake, that it dreams about, when sleeps" is just suitable for the Armenian 
scientists. God bless them! But we shall say: "If you saw the wind you reap the whirlwind". Let us assume that 
Patkanov, as it becomes an Armenian scientist did not deign to read "Vcpkhvis-Tkaosani", because it is a 
Georgian's work. We shall forgive professor for such lack of knowledge but we shall only ask him: how he 
dares to say that "your "Kartlis-Tskhovrcba" is good for nothing", when such well-known scientists, competent 
in this field, as Jean Sen-Marten, Vivien-De-Sen-Marten and Dyubua de Monpere say clearly and distinctly that 
the Georgian historical legends are worth notice as they are the sources for the history not only of the Caucasus 
but Asia as well. In this case Dyubua mentions the Georgians as the most ancient nation that from time out of 
mind [20-21] 
has been the guard for the Transcaucasus and had relations with all nationalities known at that time. 
    If somebody wants to be more convinced that Patkanov can do some other tricks, let him read the work 
by D.Bakradzc: "Professor Patkanov and the Georgian sources" then he will see more clearly, with what skill 
this wonderful Armenian professor had dealt with the works of Langlua and Stephanoza. D.Bakradzc charges 
the cunning professor with it and gives a lot of facts, by the way, he proves that the Georgian chronicle on the 
contrary, had an influence on the historical sources of the Armenians themselves. Who doesn't believe this, let 
him read and criticize severely the above mentioned work by D.Bakradze. 
    In any case, Patkanov goes on father and since he began to enjoy appropriation of foreign lands, he 
knows no restraint: he also stretches out his hands for Tchaneti, according to Moisei Khorensky, Javeni, i.e. for 
Khaldeya, he says, it was the part of the Armenian kingdom. "When and where has it been written about?" 
D.Bakradzc asks the brave and with increased appetite Armenian professor and he is right. If Moisei Khorensky 
writes that about two thousand years ago the Armenians lived in those places called Khaldeya, nowadays 
everybody knows that it is a cock-and bull story. It is also known to everybody that the patriarch of Armenian 
historians deserves not so much confidence, fame and glory, as the Armenians think. 
 12
    Lenorman, acknowledged by all competent scientists, says the following: "The fact that the Armenians 
had no national legend before Tigran I, Kir's contemporary, is an indisputable truth. Narration on the events 
before this period of time, all the stories of the Armenian writers are founded on Moisei Khorensky's work 
which is none other than a simple copy from the compilation of false narration by Marobaz Katina. This man 
lived in the first century AD, was engaged in literature, belonged to the Edcss school and it is he who made the 
compilation, where he introduced more lie, than truth and all that he built following the chronological system of 
Ktezy: to say nothing of something else, the mere imitation of this system had to remove it from the truth. In 
order to deceive a credulous reader Katina resorted to such slyness:he dated his compilation back to the time of 
Alexander the Great. The similar tricks were wide-spread at the Katina's time, the whole world was flooded with 
such falsifications" (see Lenorman "Assyriological letters ", series 1, letter 2) [21-22] 
    We cite here the Lcnorman's opinion based on the facts not to compromise Moisei Khorensky in his 
fellow's eyes. But later this resulted in such thing that we were convinced once more, what laudatory customs 
and tactic methods are inherent to all Armenian scholars, in general, and their standard-bearer Patkanov, in 
particular. Mr.Lenorman expressed his point of view concerning Moisei Khorensky in 1871. It goes without 
saying, it was probably not very pleasant to those who praised and honored Moisci Khorensky. What could they 
do? Could a Dwarf fight with almost Holiaf of Science - Lenorman! And even if he dares what will he win? 
And how did Patkanov find a way out? There the dog lies buried! 
    Patkanov pretended to be deaf, as if there were neither Lcnorman, nor his opinion of Moisei Khorensky 
and rather much time later when Lenorman's opinion had been cleared up, he proceeded to the critical analysis 
of Moisei Khorensky as though on his own initiative and he himself came across that opinion of Moisei 
Khorensky which had already been expressed by Lenorman before. Thus, he claimed somebody's words as his 
own, he opened once more America that had already been opened and began to'look at everybody from the 
height of his grandeur. How do you like such action? If it is not to your taste then listen to Patkanov's associates, 
what they are speaking about this brave professor: "The most capital Patkanov's work in history was just this 
work." (Fraternal help, page 60, 2nd edition). They say: "The people themselves will investigate - who tells the 
truth, who lies". He who has made up this proverb tells lies! 
     If it is really the most capital Patkanov's work then what kind of work must be non-capital?! We shall 
ask about it another scientist, namely Mr.Marr, the present day professor of the Armenian language at St.Peters-
burg University. "I am Patkanov's pupil" - Marr makes a proud statement. The defence of an educator by a pupil 
in worth praising but there are also such words: "An educator deserves beating, when his pupil is bad". 
     Marr hasn't become famous yet thanks to the tricks similar to Patkanov's, God forbid, but in all other 
respects he follows in his footsteps: he rides a high horse as if threatening "not to let a bird pass in the skies 
overhead and an ant on the ground under feet". Listen to this talk with Akaky Tseretely and you will see with 
what arrogance he is boasting of his erudition, with what self-confidence he is discussing, associating himself 
with an assembly of the most educated people. Lately Mr.Golmstrem pictures him to 
[22-23] 
us almost as a rising star on the science sky-line. All this reminds the proverb: "Where is a horse with its 
hoof, there is a crawfish with its claws". 
    But it is not our business. Let a crawfish turn towards a horse but we shall be busy with our own affairs. 
    In Marr's opinion, if there are some embryos of culture in Georgia, they are thanks to the Armenians. 
"If the Georgians deny it, half of the Georgians' culture will vanish",- this new rising star says. May be it is 
right, we won't mind him in this either, as we aren't going to discuss the idle questions if the Georgians are more 
cultural than the Armenians or vice versa. Let idlers discuss them. We should like only to say that when such 
scientists as Marr propagate things like that, they must confirm their words by arguments. 
    Marr has touched even our language with his sharp word. The abundance of words in the language is a 
sign of abundance of concepts in the nation and when historical circumstances bring into contact one language 
with another, then more cultural language influences the weakest one. 
    (In 1926 academician S.Acharyan proved in one of his works that there were 4 thousands of the 
Azerbaijan words in the Armenian language). 
    Marr makes an attempt to knock at us in some other respect as well, as if he has a grudge against us and 
is taking vengeance on us. He threatens for a long time:give me some time and I'll tear to pieces your famous 
"Panther's skin" (Vepkhvis-Tkaosani). I think there is a manuscript in England, I'll find it and prove that your 
famous poem is either translated or adopted from there. Oh, great Rustaveli, the pride of ours! You appeared to 
be an ordinary thief and like the Armenian scribes claimed somebody's work as his own! But we thought you a 
great man and we were proud of your name and fame! Mr.Marr is not an ordinary mortar as to threaten and not 
to know that "a word like an arrow shot from the bow-string can't come back". He threatened and though seven 
or eight years passed since that day but his threat remained as a threat. 
 13
   Marr knows perfectly that "Panther's skin" is an invaluable treasure for us, it is the base of our national 
self-respect and pride. Thus, if somebody wants to strike a death-blow and to bereave us of the base for our 
fame and pride, then it is best to approach us from this side. 
   Is it decent having no data yet, without their examination and, perhaps, without knowing if there are 
such in the world to profane a really great man [23-24] 
of this or that nation, to violate the sanctity, which they admire for nearly seven or eight centuries? And to 
do all that on the ground that professor Marr has seen in his dreams that there is some manuscript in England, 
which does not exist in reality! (By the way, in 1912 Marr being in Baku delivered a lecture where he confirmed 
once more his hypothesis that Shota Rustaveli is a Moslem. In such way one nation was set at another. (A.M.) 
     The actions of the Armenian scribes-scholars arc like a large river, the farther from the shore you are 
going, the deeper you arc sinking into it, the more clearly you sec its length and width. Their boldness and 
impudence grow every day, more and more freely they begin to praise themselves and more and more freely to 
treat us. Nowhere else their program of actions, their adopted slyness and pushing ways arc so distinctly 
outlined as in one of the European newspaper which lists everything that can serve for glorifying the Armenians 
and annihilation of the Georgians, perhaps, suggested by these scientists. Here these miserable bosses aren't 
ashamed of anything, disdain nothing. They use openly and frankly such tricks and means the only thought of 
which must make blush any man, though it were an Armenian or somebody else. 
    During the last war, namely in 1877, French newspaper "Temp" sent a correspondent to our country, 
whose name was Kutuli. What could a frivolous Frenchman do if he had been caught in the trap? As a result, 
everything appeared to be Armenian: the Parliament was Armenian, feasts and entertainments - Armenian, 
holidays - Armenian, Dellingers and Giatsints - the Armenians, philosophers - Armenians, dishes - Armenian as 
well. And where? In Tiflis! Perhaps, there is Armenia here and Tiflis is a city of Armenia. What another 
conclusion could draw this so skillfully entangled newcomer?! So Kutuli who was fascinated by the hospitality 
of the Armenians and having not left Tiflis as yet exclaimed: "Probably, Eden has been here, in Armenia!". 
Thus the European correspondent was persuaded that Georgia including Tiflis was Armenia and he was forced 
to spread this news throughout the world with the help of such respectable and influential newspaper as "Temp". 
"Our nation doesn't like poetry, - we are more fond of judgments and criticism". In this way the foreigner was 
persuaded by Art-sruni and his company called by Kutuli as "the artsrunian school". I don't know how it is 
possible to be proud of dislike for poetry, but the Great Goethe said: "He, whose heart can't be made trembling 
by a poet's voice is a [24-25] 
barbarian". A lot of other hymns have been sung by the Armenian philosophers to their own glory and 
delight. We won't cite here all of them as our talk has already been delayed. The strangest thing was that the 
Armenian scientists' tricks had been in secret for a short time and the same Kutuli understood very soon who 
were those much-praised Armenians in the Caucasus. The fact is that while Kutuli was in Tiflis, he wasn't tired 
of praising them but when he used to be in the Erivan province and had a look at them with his own eyes on 
their own smouldering ruins then he began to sing another song: "The Armenians in their Motherland are 
cowards, ignorant and indifferent to the fate of their Motherland". 
     Thus, as it is seen, it appeared that both the scholars and the nation take care only of their fate and they 
are brave only in cases when they, as their proverb says, feel the smell of bread. 
     To lend a helping hand to these scholars, to give greater force and convincingness to their army one 
Armenian general Kishmishcv now late, has joined them. Without a general an army is not the armyl^nd to keep 
up with the scholars like him he also began to insult us. General Kishmishcv wrote a composition published 
after his death under the title "The last days of the Georgian Kingdom". At the end of the XVIII century, 
Kishmishcv dared to say: "Georgia became similar to a ship cast ashore from where who was stronger could 
take everything he liked". 
     "Shop-keepers and merchants,- he said, supported and kept hungry tsarevitches and knights ". 
(See work by Kishmishev "The last years of the Georgian Kingdom", pages 112-113). 
     
      Mr. Ezov tries roughly, slyly, unskillfully, in unscientific way, in front of everybody to turn white into 
black. He himself intentionally closing his eyes and stopping up his cars imagines that all others also got blind, 
deaf and are not able to understand his tricks. But Mr.Ezov is a learned and intellectual person. We don't think 
that really learned and intellectual person will allow himself what he lets at this moment. Right is the proverb 
that says: "A raven won't become white, however hard you rub it with sand". 
      Being not satisfied that he deprived our country of its name, degraded our tsars and turned them into 
the Persian functionaries, Mr.Ezov attacked [25-26] 
the whole Georgian nation and began to flay it in his notorious work. Of course, can an Armenian scholar 
shake his dust off himself so as not lo stain us? 
     This Armenian archbishop (i.e. Minas) was at that time in Gandja together with Vakhtang and from 
there he with patriarch Isaya accompanied him to Tiflis. Thus,both of these Armenian high-ranking ecclesiastic 
 14
persons were the eye-witnesses of all the Georgian's acts of that time. One of them says: "The greedy, grasping 
Georgians have robbed completely Armenians and treated meanly our faith", but the second remembers them 
with gratitude and considers it to be the God's mercy that tsar Vakhtang became their protector, has saved them 
from enemies and takes care of them. 
     It goes without saying that Vakhtang rendered this support with the help of his people, otherwise what 
he could do alone?! 
      What has Mr. Ezov done with these two mutually discrepant evidences? In this case a real scientist 
cither would believe nobody of them or, to be too careful, he would also give evidence of the second if he 
referred to one of them. But Mr. Ezov acted quite differently. He made speaking detractor of the Georgians, but 
he purposely made keep silence that person who had praised them. How shall we call such action, I don't know, 
but it is quite clear that as diploma doesn't make a scientist, just the same a cassock cannot make a monk and "a 
pumpkin won't become crystal, however high you put it on the shelf". 
     In any case, our question will be to the point, if we ask: let the Georgians be very mean people, to 
Ezov's pleasure, but what about the Georgians' meanness when he is speaking of "the relations of Peter the 
Great with the Armenian people? What is in common between the Georgians "meanness" and these "relations"? 
Couldn't the rage find another way out? It is evident, in order to kick his dear brothers - the Georgians and not to 
miss such a lucky chance as to perform a feat sacred for the Armenians. 
    Pay attention to one fact more that Mr. Ezov jeered at tsar Irakly, the autocratic tsar of Georgia, some 
time inspiring fear to the Persia itself, - he said that Irakly allowed Russia to occupy the place that didn't belong 
to him , - but he surrounded their monk-Minas, who had promised Gandja-Karabakh to Russia with halo of 
glory and fame! It means that Georgia didn't belong to tsar Irakly but monk Minas could be a master of the 
destiny for [26-27] 
Gandja-Karabakh ruled at that time, no offence meant to scientist Esov, by Persian khans but not by this 
monk Minas. 
     Only then you will guess a riddle when you remember Esov's secret thought: "GEORGIA IS NOT 
GEORGIA BUT ANCIENT ARMENIA". What on earth they perform, what on earth mean and dirty arms they 
take up in order to proclaim their grandeur and to splash us with mud: and how they lay themselves out to 
inspire the Armenians with hatred and contempt towards us. Meanwhile, they themselves are shouting that it is 
indecent in the XIX century to set one nation at another and the similar pompous phrases reminding a gold-
plated nut shell, the kernel of which is worm eaten. 
     It means that to set at, to attack - one must, but to protect oneself, to parry blows - it is a sin. Let them 
swindle babies by such philosophy, but they cannot silence sensible grown-ups, cannot suppress in a human 
such sacred feeling as dignity. For a man the dearest treasure is his personality and nobody will be astonished if 
an honest man attack the offender of his personality in noble fury. Education imparts some gentleness of woven 
silk to a noble man, when he feels some compassion for his people and gives him the strength of hammered iron 
when he comes forward in defence of his dignity. In the first case gentleness is a merit, in the second - 
cowardice and faint-heartedness. In the first case firmness is cruelty, in the second - a merit. 
     In order to arrive at the truth in the Armenian question, we should fix our eyes on the ancient antiquity, 
archaeologists, scientists and travellers, who had no time, they say, to be inspired with the "political wisdom 
"and to spoil their scientific point of view with the help of it. "Stones also scream" - says Mr.Golmstrem. The 
stones scattered about the Ararat Hills and its nearest neighborhood, not far from Van lake, near Urmiya, near 
Erzerum and at last in the Erivan province and Kars region. 
   "Stones, they say, never lie... ". Stones never lie, it is quite right, but we repeat "a good narrator needs a 
good listener". Below we shall see that stones had bad listeners. "The inscriptions on the stones in fiery letters 
narrate about the events of Assyrian-Babylonian antiquity ". 
   Here is what Mr. Golmstrem tells us. Our assyriologist-archeologist Nicolsky having passed round those 
places in 1893 made important discoveries. The wedge-shaped inscriptions found in those places have been [27-
28] 
written in the special language and narrate about a numerous tribe living in the upper reaches of the Tigris 
and Efrat, near the Van lake near Urma and Gokchaj. On the Assyrian monuments of the X and IX centuries 
B.C. this tribe was called "nairi". 
     "When in the second part of the IX century it was gathered in one state it began to be mentioned as 
Urartu country , from where, he says, the Jewish noun Ararat originates, the names are similar. The center of 
this Kingdom Urartu was first in the Erivan lowland but then following the strategic considerations was 
transferred to the South, to Eastern sides of Van lake. The country of Urartu tsars adopted its culture from the 
Assyrians-Babylonians but many times successfully disputed the part of a world power from Assyrian tsars. In 
the time of Assyrian tsar Tiglat - Palasar III, in the first part of the VIII century in struggle, the odds were in 
Urartu favor: the whole North and partly the West of Assyrian monarchy passed into the hands of Urartuans. 
The scales of struggle swung and it could happen that Urartu would seize the world supremacy and give quite 
 15
different orientation io the world history. But changes in the government and unexpected raising of power saved 
Assyria. Its enemies were defeated. Urartu tsar Ursa excited the whole North and partly the West to rebellion 
against Assyria but was defeated. 
   Apart from all this, according to Nicolsky's words, the inscriptions narrate about Urartu culture showing 
the origination of cities, places, construction of ditches, etc. 
    The letters were engraved following either Assyrian tsar's orders or Urartu, it depended on the fact in 
whose hands the power was. These monuments of hoary mysterious antiquity have traces of fighting of two 
origins-brutal and more humane, they say, the first is personified by Assyria, the second - by Urartu. 
    Among the meanest acts lie and deception are the most disgraceful and distrustful. We are very sorry 
that the Armenian scientists did not pity even this pure newspaper and led it into error with such practical 
reckoning: if the lie is a success, that's fine, if it fails, that is no business of theirs that the newspaper will be 
caught lying. And they won't grieve much for Mr. Golmstrem, the most important thing is to make a cat's paw 
of other people. Otherwise they won't be reputed for the Armenian scientists - with this aim in view it does not 
become to them to spare somebody's feelings and to take [28-29] 
care of the man's good name. In the book of their commercial ethics there is no such rule. "In addition to 
this, let's note that 70 years later well-known Soviet scientist B.B. Piotrovsky has not fallen under influence of 
modern Armenian scientists and smashed the wild idea: Urartu - Armenia. However, let's return to 
I.Chavchavadze. 
    "Fransua Lenorman, mentioned above, is an expert of ancient history and authoritative researcher of 
wedge-shaped inscriptions, Assyrian-Babylonian in particular, and it is these inscriptions which according to 
Mr. Golmstrem, are screaming in the Armenians favor, have been thoroughly investigated by this Lenorman". 
    It is he who proves that Armenian is a geographical name and first mentioned in the time of 
Akhamcnidcs, namely at the end of the VII century B.C., then no mention was made of the Armenians, i.e. 
Gaikans in those places, which Assyrian, as well as wedge-shaped inscriptions call by a collective name - the 
country "Nairi" and later on "Urartu" but the tribe who lived there as Urartuans: Kaikantsy, Gaioses (the 
Armenians) came to Urartu in the VI century B.C. , the wedge-shaped inscriptions narrating about Urartuans 
refer to the earlier period, as the latest inscription dates from the IX century B.C. 
(Lenorman, Assyriological letters, series I, letter 2, pages 124-129). 
 
      It is clear that wedge-shaped inscriptions engraved 9 centuries B.C. could not narrate about the people 
who appeared later after three centuries. "Stones are screaming", aren't they, Armenian scientists, scholars? 
They are screaming but your cars are close for them ". 
     Let's put aside even this IX century, when the true legends were engraved on the stones and when no 
mention had been made of Armenians yet. "Nairi" country later known as "Urartu", is mentioned on some 
inscription even under Assyrian tsar Salmansar and then under Tiglat-Palasar. Salmansar I ruled in the XIV 
century, but Tiglat-Palasar I in the XII century B.C. 
("Oriental antiquities and other works of Mr. Nicolsky, page 389),  
  
      Have we any reason or not to ask Mr.GoImstrem: how could those wedge-shaped inscriptions, those 
stones called by him to be witnesses tell us about the Armenians, when they only six or seven hundred, at least, 
three hundred years later appeared in the country, where the Urartuans were aborig- [29-30] 
ines and fought with the Assyrians for six or seven centuries before the Armenian's arrival? And it they, 
Urartuans, have some services for the world history, were characterized by the strength of character, culture, 
displayed their physical and moral might, then of course, for the sake of their fame but not for glorifying and 
extolling of the Armenians. 
   It is clear that wedge-shaped inscription, the screams of which inspired Mr.Golmstrem so much and 
which, according to his words dated from the IX century, cannot confirm descent of the Armenians from the 
Urartuans and in this case we quite often encounter the same scientific flippancy, when the Armenian 
philosophers and Dellingers turn the talk to the Armenians. "Philology - says Lenorman, -is the algebra of the 
so-called linguistics, it is a powerful and lofty means, a restorer of ancient ethnography " It proves us that 
aborigines of the country called Armenia up to the end of the XII century B.C. were kindred tribe with that one, 
among which there were the Georgians and some modern nationalities of the Caucasus. Those are the 
aborigines, whom the Bible calls "togorms" having nothing in common with the sons of Gaios. Iezekil also calls 
Armenia aborigines as 'togorms", while most of the wedge-shaped inscription have been already engraved on 
the stones - inscriptions known up to now under the name "Vanian". 
     Lenorman proves quite clearly that the Urartuans and Alarodians are synonyms. Besides Lenorman, 
famous English scientist Raulinson, to whom Lenorman himself made references, proves just the same. On this 
identity of the Urartuans with Alarodians Lenorman has drawn his conclusion that the Urartu language and 
wedge-shaped inscriptions must be called Alarodian but not Armenian. He confirms that neither this language 
 16
nor nation have relationship with the Armenian language and nation. Raulinson says, - Lenorman adds that 
Alardu is a simple version of "Araruda", as the ancient Persians pronounced 1 and t in the same manner. From 
"Ararudi" there is a slight conversion to "Ararat" and hence to "Urartu" mentioned in the Assyrian inscriptions. 
    "The language of wedge-shaped inscriptions has no even remote resemblance with the Gaikan language 
- Lenorman says - "Those people who had engraved these inscriptions and 6 centuries B.C. reigning in Armenia 
had no relationship with the Armenians, Gaioscs, neither in origin nor in their language.[30-31] 
 
    The Gaioscs came to Armenia when the Vanian inscriptions had already been, namely at the time when 
that nation (Urartu) who had engraved these inscription, weakened during many centuries by the endless wars 
with terrible rulers (Assyrians) and Babylon moved to the north, just to the places called Iveriya in ancient times 
and Georgia at present". 
    Thus, according to Lenorman's words, it means that the Armenians assume unjustly the name of 
Urartuans, they consider wrongfully the previous Great Armenia to be their primeval motherland and if 
somebody inherited some valours and virtues and can be proud of them - it is the Georgians but not Armenians. 
    The late Ilja Serebryakov, a professor of the Lazarev Institute writes in one of his articles: Lenorman 
not only has eliminated any thought of the kindred origin of the Armenians and Georgians but even the territory 
of Armenia up to Akhamenides he has withdrawn from their possession and assigned them to the Georgians for 
ever. This fact made professor Patkanov angry to such an extent that he couldn't be quiet for 13 years and at last 
"when he couldn't invent something better" he published a well-known topical sa-tire, in which he appropriated 
somebody else's work at the great dexterity perverted the facts and by this he took it into his head to annihilate 
the Georgian's chronicles as well. 
      How could the late professor Serebryakov wonder at the Armenian scientist's action! This vice is not 
new but was characteristic of Armenian scholars since olden days. We have cited many facts for this in the 
given article. The Georgians may be suspected in prejudiced attitude to wards this object. Now let's listen to 
such witnesses as Lenorman and Genrikh Raulinson and see that distortion, appropriation of somebody else's 
things, rubbing out and scraping of inscriptions on monuments, seizure of foreign lands and some other similar 
virtues were Armenians' qualities for a long time and for ages they have been familiar with these tricks. 
    "On the basis of the above-mentioned facts, - said Lenorman, - I am obliged to say the same as Genrikh 
Raulinson did: the language of "Urartu" has no relationship with the real Gaios language. Gaioscs, who come 
from Frigiya little by little occupied high places to the East of Frigiya from where they forced out a part of 
Urartuans, some part of them they assimilated but their names, faith language and traditions they replaced by 
their own" [31-32] 
    Replacement of somebody else's names, language, traditions, etc. by their own for a long time proved 
to be habitual for the Armenians - but "habit is the second nature". 
    In the same composition Lenorman says that the Armenians wrongfully claim their descent from 
Torgomos. Why not? For this they have not gone to great expense, it is free of charge. 
   Thus, the loud and terrible yell of Mr.Golmstrem "Stones also will scream! Stones don't lie! turns out to 
be only idle talk and his yell for the Armenians is just Pharisalsm, after which only ashes and fumes remain. It 
follows that a man can make himself at his own wish deny his words and such reliable witnesses as "screaming 
stones". If it happens to an Armenian scientist - it is clear for the present. Such tricks is a habitual disease of Ar-
menian scientists. You know, there are people, for whom habitual qrief is better than unwanted gaiety". But the 
most striking is the fact that he who treats science in this way yells: "Stones also scream! Stones don't lie! Have 
you ever heard such a thing - to jeer at the screams of stones and at their indisputable evidences! Willy-nilly, 
you say: "Oh, life, what's your essence, what's your law. Why do you twist us like a toy?" (Shota Rustaveli's 
words). Let's read Mr.Nicolsky himself and discuss. 
    "Urartu, according to the Assyrian and Babylonian sources, was a part of greater country which was 
called in them Nairi... In the science there has not been established yet a correct notion and exact name of these 
nationalities but, in Lcnorman's and Golmslrem's opinion, they might be called as the Alarodians...". 
   If the present day Georgians do not belong to it (nation of Alarodians), it should be regarded as 
vanishing from the society of present inhabitants of Asia Minor and the Transcaucasus.  ' 
(see "Oriental antiquities", v. /, p. 389 by Nicolsky). 
   "Stones scream! Stones don't lie!". It is not stones scream but, Mr. Golm-strem's hasty action is 
screaming Mr. Golmstrem tells lies beating his breast as a Pharisee and shedding crocodile tears on the 
desecrated truth. The comedy is good on stage, but when in reality before our eyes some piece of cloth is burned 
instead of a heart with hope that it will be taken for the heart, such a comedy makes your blood boil. Mr. 
Nicolsky goes on farther and speaks that the greatest and most powerful people in Syria and Asia Minor were 
Khctly, they created their own culture and were a courageous [32-33] 
rival for Egypt and Syria. The Khetty belonged to the Alarodian tribe and that the Alarodians may be the 
same nation as the Urartuans - from the word "Urarta" is Ararat, only the letter is replaced by I. 
 17
    We have already seen that in vain Mr. Golmstrem referred to Mr.Nicolsky allegedly proving the 
relationship of the Urartuans with Armenians. Now we'll refer to the same Nicolsky to show how hard the 
Armenian scribes resort to various tricks to make screaming stones speak what the scribes like and thus make 
even them tell lies. 
    According to Mr. Nicolsky's words, Armenian bishop Mesrop has found some wedge-shaped 
inscriptions. That is what he says in this connection: "In the early 60's Mr. Mesrop, an ordinary monk at that 
time, having read that there are wedge-shaped inscriptions in those places where the Armenians live at present, 
decided to collect them, thinking that they will have much relevance to the ancient history of Armenia". 
According to the same Nicolsky, Mr. Mesrop was lucky but differently. He found six or seven inscriptions and 
having taken them off, sent them to the scientists, experts in this field, namely Mordtmon Sase and Muller. 
Professor Patkanov acted as a middle-man, as he thought that these inscriptions were Armenian historical 
monuments and of course, he went into raptures over it. Later on it was found, Nicolsky said, that those 
inscriptions had been written in the language having nothing in common with Armenian. 
     It goes without saying, this news disconcerted both Mr.Mcsrop and Mr. Patkanov. One should know 
that a greater part of these inscriptions was found to the North-West of Echmiadzin, within 25 versts from it. 
There is a hill "Bluri" in that place and near it there are some ancient ruins; for a long time the Armenians have 
their eyes on them and say that their capital, some mythical "Armavir" was just there. The curious scientists 
reached those places as well. They began excavations under the guidance of comrade Uvarov, examined the 
stones for 7 days - but they found nothing comforting and joyful for the Armenians. Mesrop and Patkanov 
began to argue and accuse mem of bad excavations. They required those places to be examined once more. 
   Such persistence, - Nicolsky said, - can be explained only by erroneous opinion of the character and 
origin of inscriptions and by understandable, on the part of Armenian scientists, desire to find the ancient capital 
of Armenia. [33-34] 
 
(see "Oriental antiquities", v. I, page 380). 
     One can sec that an inalienable quality of Armenian scientists is to achieve their aim by means of their 
stubbornness. Evidently, insisting on their own they try to hush up everything that upsets their plan, even if it 
were the indisputable truth. 
  Among inscriptions found by Mr. Mcsrop, according to Nicolsky, there is one under № XV found not 
for from the place "Zakhalu". The photo of this inscription was shown in newspaper "The Ararat" published in 
Echmiadzin. Nicolsky writes concerning this inscription that the photo from Zakhalu inscription in "The Ararat 
" presents such a disfigured text that its symbols almost have no resemblance to those of the Vanian script. One 
can guess that a photographer deliberately wanted them to have resemblance in their form to the symbols of the 
Persian Akhamenides taking into his head that they arc of the same or allied origin. 
(see "Oriental antiquities", v. /, p. 380). 
     Those, who take stones out of ancient monasteries or scrape Georgian inscriptions and replace them by 
Armenian or steal these stones and throw them away, arc not strangers to such tricks and falsification. The 
question arises: what's use of distortion the above-mentioned inscription? It's true, mountebankery, falsification 
and forgery require high skill, long practice and some courage but, however, it is not the business to be attracted 
by or to dare oneself to deal with it only for the sake of art. Consequently, we ask: what for do they need to 
import the character of inscriptions of the Akhamenides epoch to the ancient inscriptions of the Assyrian epoch, 
as it is seen from Nicolsky's words? The following interest can be supposed: from the text above we know how 
important for a real scientist the fact that the Vanian inscriptions dale from the pre-Akhamenides epoch but the 
Armenians appeared in Armenia only in the time of Akhamenides, they had been there before - that's why the 
Armenian scientists try to prove that the inscriptions date from the Akhamenides epoch, but not Assyrian. If 
these inscriptions dated from the Assyrian epoch, i.e. when no Armenians were mentioned in the places where 
the inscription had been found, the Armenians could not appropriate them so easily. But if they appeared to 
belong to Akhamenides epoch, then they could easily spin a web from falsification for assuming somebody 
else's name and history and nobody could object them: "You have [34-35] 
not been yet when these inscriptions appeared". Aren't these tricks and falsification just the same what 
D.Bakradze, Ilya Serebryakov, Lenorman, Raulinson and Nicolsky said about the Armenian scientists or isn't 
the same what we arc speaking about in the given paper?! Isn't it clear after all that such scientists as Patkanov, 
such philosophers as Artsruni and various Ezovs, Khudabashovs and their company do not disdain to use any 
means to rehabilitate themselves and to cast a slur upon us. If only we, Georgians, spoke of this feature of 
Armenian scientists, it might be thought that such opinions were dictated by hostility and envy. But Lenorman, 
Raulinson, Nicolsky are not our relatives or God-parents to be suspected in a prejudiced attitude. 
   Mr. Golmstrem, unfortunately, dances to these Armenian scientists' piping and the stones screaming for 
Georgians he makes scream for the Armenians, he sounds the alarm and exclaims: "Stones also scream! Stones 
don't lie!". In this case it is not stones that tell lies, they tell the truth, - it is juggling Armenian wise men and 
 18
philosophizing jugglers, such as Esov and others. "Scream and tell lies ". It is some special group which as if 
agreed to dupe the world: to turn a fox, a jackal into a lion and a lion into a cat and, like a plucked brood hen to 
hatch chicken in the former aerie of eagles. 
    Mr.Golmstrem was so much carried away by the idea of glorifying Armenians that he considered it 
possible to say the following: "These people (Armenian) during many centuries have proved their unshakable 
devotion to the Christian orthodox behests ". (See his topical satire "Stones will also scream"). 
   There is no need to say that every nation considers its religion to be righteous and nobody can dispute it. 
Religion is the matter of conscience, belief and everybody is free and inviolable in it. But even a child knows 
that the Armenians arc of Grigorian religion and don't belong at all to the religion, which is known as orthodox 
in Russia, in general and in Russian literature, in particular. Thus, Golmstrem's words that "the Armenians have 
proved their unshakable devotion to the christian orthodox behests" are wrong, because they declined this 
religion as far back as the VI century and since that time they separated from orthodoxy. 
     In conclusion we must put the following question: What made Mr. Golmstrcm torture those miserable 
stones, trouble the respected scientists and send history to the devil? We don't know that and have no wish to 
learn but [35-36] 
we are surprised and striken by the fact that in this case as well the same program is taking effect which 
the Armenian scientists as though have inherited: one man may steal a horse, while another may not look over a 
hedge. We shall trumpet about ourselves and they are crying from the house-tops. Stretch a tread from 
Senkovsky to Golmslrem and you'll see that for 60 years all the Armenian scribes have been sticking this thread 
and following the same program with common consent and conformity of ideas. They snatch at this program by 
their teeth, hands, feet and by the whole body. Isn't it clear that they wish to show all over the world that there 
are no better, more stable and more capable than the Armenians in Asia Minor and in the Transcaucasus, in 
particular. It is true, there are some vratzi in the Transcaucasus and someone mentions them more or less but 
we'll bind their hands and feet, defame their name in such a way that not a trace will remain from them. If they 
have some history we'll discredit or appropriate it, if they have the territory, we'll bereave them of it and by 
hook or by crook we'll convince the world that the Georgians arc following the path of degeneration and any 
day now they'll die out or become the Armenians. 
    It is too difficult to endure these Khudabashcvs, Kishmishcvs, Ezovs, Artsruni and, in general, that 
group of Armenians who can praise themselves as much as they want. God bless them, but whom we won't give 
up ourselves to profanation and we hope that any wise Armenian in this case will be in sympathy with our ideas. 
Well, that is where the beginning and the end, Alpha and Omega of that terrible discord which had been spread 
with such ardour among us and set the Georgians and Armenians against each other. Just these and only these 
ignorant talkers-philosophers broke our friendly relations between the Georgians and vice versa, otherwise why 
no hostility existed between us fifty or sixty years ago. We didn't keep away from each other, though we were 
different in our origin and religion but therpwas no hatred between us because of the nationality, to our 
happiness and honor, and if this unity was shaken, it should be attributed to the cowardice, ignorance, idleness 
and tricks of the Armenian scholars-scientists. Only one Ezov was quite enough to be frightened of yourself and 
to exclaim in despair: can it really be true that a man is the God's image and likeness?! Let the Lord inflict a 
punishment on everybody for his fault and forgive him if only such sin can be absolved!!! [36-37] 
    But let them not try to deprive us of our name and by humiliation of our name let them not try to glorify 
theirs!!! 
   "Why does the truth perish so foolishly while the falsity is alive? " 
Yu. Morits. 
   With the help of I.Chavchavadzc and R. Dzhaparidze we have watched the Armenian scholars' tricks. 
We shouldn't forget another feature of theirs. They buy and destroy all the copies of publications unmasking 
them and subject the author to such obstruction that a non-informed public falls under these wailings and 
gronnings. 
   That has happened to Velichko and Mets, Pushkin and Kerte, Amphitcatrov and Bakradze, Nekrasov 
and Chavchavadze, Sokolsky and Myasnikov, Bukshpan and Griboedov, Leskov and Tverdokhlebov, 
Odshelidze and Acharyan, Anuchin and Gukasyan, Yust, Pavlovilch, Piotrovsky and many others. 
    Here is a typical fact. At all limes the Armenians (the talk is exclusively about the elite part of 
intelligentsia - A.M.) having spread the discord, disorder and anti-government uprising and being afraid of 
complete unmasking under the pretence of "genocide", "oppression" and other infamies invented by themselves 
move to new places, forming new and new regions of compact residence. 
    The situation was this with the Karabakh region, Stavropol territory, Krasnodar, the Northern Caucasus 
(from Georgievsk to Kislovodsk), the Crimea, Moscow, Middle Asia, the USA, England, Syria, the Lebanon, 
Canada, France, Egypt, Turkey, Greece, Bulgaria, Belgium, Iran, (and at present already with Australia, 
Indonesia, where they have not been known yet). As it was written in the article "Emigration: a new tide?" 
("Ncdclya", No22, 1989): "Perhaps, it will be interesting to learn where they arc leaving for. As a rule, for 
 19
America and Canada. Of course, they arc going to Europe as well. The Germans for example, to FRG, the 
Armenians all over the world...". 
    How does it happen? And what about the motherland - "The Great Armenia", "historic home" - 
Nagorny Karabakh? Where are you leaving for, oh, "the great" and ardent "patriots" of Armenia? 
    This and other questions it is impossible to answer better than M.S.Gorbachev when he had put off all 
the international affairs and urgently come to [37-38] 
Armenia together with his wife and some members of the Political Bureau. Having "warm and hearty 
welcome" he said for all the country to hear: "They don't need Karabakh. Karabakh serves as a cover. Look 
here, there is such a tragedy of nation but they - Karabakh... " 
    Well, the Armenians won't forgive these unmasking words. To confirm this Armenian mafiosi began 
acting. The visible part of mafia (iceberg?-A.M.) frankly and not unsuccessfully by means of threats and 
blackmail call armed men (according to M.S.Gorbachev - "the bearded") for large-scale provocations, when the 
aspersions are cast on the leaders of the country, without any evidences accusing them of bribery and 
corruption. 
     It is getting clear that without corresponding power, including material, assistance of the "upper strata" 
inspector of the USSR procurator's office Telman Gdlyan, who himself had been wallowed in crimes, would 
hardly dare such step. In this case, he being afraid of exposing, without shame and ceremony, with the 
impudence characteristic of him, proposed to the deputies of the Congress to include only and only his 
candidatures in the commission for inquiry of his doubtful dirty activity in Uzbekistan. Since 30% of USSR 
procurator's office workers arc of his nation with Karagesov at the head, already ex-chief of the inspection 
department. Many people think that Gdlyan and Karagesov have risen in the name of justice and honesty, 
struggle with corruption. No, they had another aim! To spread distrust among Politburo members! In simple 
Russian it is called blackmail! 
     It has already been said that some group of Armenian scientists does not perceive the voice of truth, it 
tries -to use all the power of vocal chords to drown a shy and solitary source of objective information. It is 
sufficient to note how they in a well-trained chorus screamed on the occasion of one trustworthy publication by 
academician Z.Buniyatov, who made bold to say the truth about Sumgait. 
     Academicians of the Academy of sciences, Armenian SSR: E.Agayan, B.Arakelyan, G.Brutyan, 
G.Garibdzhanyan, E.Dzherbashyan, G.Dzhaukyan, S.Eremyan, R.Zoryan, M.Nersisyan, G.Sarkisyan, 
corresponding members G.Ovetisyan, S.Arevshatyan, V.Barkhudaryan, V.Davtyan, V.Nalbandyan, 
G.Gamrasyan, V.Khodzhabekyan, Doctors of sciences P.Muradyan, T.Tiratsyan, K.Khudaverdyan, 
S.Tovmasyan in the paper "Till what time will Ziya Buniyatov falsify history" not so much "unmasked" [38-39] 
their next victim in turn as were filled with indignation and called the Georgian public for confrontation 
with Azerbaijan! It is familiar handwriting, familiar notes! 
    But on account of the historical facts we shall repeat some observations of V.Velichko from his "The 
Caucasus" published at the beginning of the XX century. By the way, the Armenian scientists stigmatized him 
as well by such epithets as "a great-power chauvinist and monarchist". I wonder what stigma they will put on 
the names of Pushkin, Griboyedov, Nckrasov and at last Kornely Tatsit - Roman historian and philosopher of 
the I century A.C.! 
    So let's listen to Vasil Vclichko: 
   "Our cosmopolitical press keeping silence of the scientists' conclusions to please foreign inspirers and 
politicians of outlying districts always starts to yell furiously, if somebody just mentions common typical 
negative features of some nationality but Russian. Russians can be "analyzed" as much as you like! But God 
forbid to tell the truth about foreigners! They yell that it is obscurantism and hatred of mankind and so on and 
they not only yell but take measures and aren't ashamed of the means selected. Everybody remembers the event 
with "Contrabandists". Our social and partly even official life (in outlying districts) is rich in such instructive 
examples. 
    Just as in nature there are sets of objects and creatures distinguished by one or another strong 
characteristic feature so human tribes have the same and they get the appropriate reputation both in history and 
among their neighbors-contemporaries. 
   Since olden days there has been formed a low opinion of the Armenians -and it goes without saying, 
with reason, otherwise it couldn't appear among whole nations and at different time. 
    But, however, one cannot help seeing injustice of such categorical and groundless opinions, the 
examples of which I'll cite below. First, it is necessary to separate the mass of Armenian people from rapacious 
plutocracy, ignorant intriguing clergy and pscudointelectuals, i.e. from ruling Armenian social strata who 
oppress not only foreign neighbors but also their tribesmen, innocent common people.[39-40] 
    Second, among the ruling classes there is rather substantial percentage of people, not bad, on the whole, 
and mainly guilty of cowardly obeying the terror of their leaders and the principle of a special, painfully 
developed, tribal or, as they say, (without any right for it) national idea. 
 20
    For an honest man dealing mainly with these leaders and their hirelings it is not difficult to be inflamed 
with groundless hatred for the Armenians but having more attentive attitude to this mysterious tribe, his 
historical fate and present-day state it is impossible not to feel compassion for the mass of Armenian people, 
who, beyond any doubt, have good inclinations. 
   But the more we sympathize with them and more closely look at their position, the more disgustful in 
our eyes arc their leaders, intriguing oppressors and trouble -makers. 
    There can be objections to me that the Armenian ruling classes are the men of the same people, whose 
sons are the embryos of just the same plunderers. But, first, the upper classes arc not always the indices of 
nation spiritual level and second, the historical and social-economical conditions under which the Armenian 
people have found themselves, as fale willed it, favored and up to now favor raising to the surface and to the 
heights of local life mainly of worse, the most vicious and sly representatives of this race. 
   Who are the Armenians, after all? Their main origin is not clear yet. History indicates the merging of a 
large mass of Jews with them first during Babylonian taking prisoner and then after Jerusalem destruclion. From 
the anthropological point of view they are mainly extreme brachycephales, i.e. short-headed and bear the 
greatest resemblance with the mountaineer Jews and Siro-Khaldeis (Aisors), as it is seen from research carried 
out by Shantr, Erkert, Pantyukhov, ct al. English scientist Berlin thinks they are people of the same type as the 
Jews of pre-Palistian period. 
    Professor D.N.Anuchkin says that the Armenians are not the Aryan tribe but rather aryanized (in 
language). Apart from the above-said, not everybody, who considers himself to be an Armenian, belongs to the 
indigenous Armenian tribe. Armenian magazine "The Murch", speaking of a substantial ability of Armenians 
for" assimilation of other nations, in the late 905 points to the presence of rather large percentage of assimilated 
Gypsies among the Armenians. 
("The Murch ", 1897. Article entitled "The .Armenians from Gypsies”[40-41]        
 
    "In the world there are only two nations without national language and homeland: the Jews and 
Gypsies. Nether Asian tyranny, nor medieval cruel persecution, nor even present day humane culture could 
assimilate them with other peoples, and thus, all these powerful factors appeared to be helpless to suppress the 
material greediness of one nation and uncontrollable unlimited striving for wandering of another. Everywhere, 
in Asia or Europe, in Old or New World, a Gypsy remained Gypsy, a Jew - Jew. Only the Armenian nation 
alone succeeded in assimilation of the Gypsies, and this I am speaking, - the author of article adds, - not without 
any proof but on the ground of reliable facts. Erivan, Shemakha, Elisavetpol, Tiflis and other Gypsies, to 
existence of which history indicated 50 years ago, ceased to be Gypsies and merged with the Armenians, having 
kept only their surnames as a far reminiscences of their origin. From whatever aspect you study this question 
you draw one and the same conclusion - not a single nation could succeed in the matter of mass assimilation but 
Armenian. Even talented people are from the assimilated Gypsies - Armenians. For example Kerobe Patkanyan 
was of Gypsy origin and monk, poet Alamdaryan - as well, two of contemporary Armenian writers are also of 
Gypsy origin national poet Ganes-ogly, who has composed many poems, et.al..." 
     The acquaintance with both tribes gives an observer the substantial material to confirm the conclusions 
of the given magazine. Even more interesting conclusion concerning some Armenian groups has been drawn by 
the Caucasian anthropologist, doctor Pantyukhov, an honorable scientist took the advantage when Tiflis was 
flooded with half-savage refugees from Turkey and put a lot of Turkish Armenians to the anthropological 
measurement. A great pari of these unbidden guests turned out to be the pure-blooded Kurds in their physical 
quality. It makes possible to assume that some episodes of Armenian slaughter in Turkey arc the result of by-
gone family feud between the Kurd tribes of different faith. 
   It is also interesting the question on the Transcaucasian Albania or, in Armenian, Agvani. This country 
which also included present-day Elisavetpol (Gandja-A.M.) province and part of Tiflis and Dagestan were 
inhabited by peoples of not Armenian origin, who had got their Christianity from the Armenians. Before the 
beginning of the XIX century there existed separate Agvan or Gmidzasar Catholicos competing with 
Echmiadzin and from time to time quite independent on the latter. At present the Christians being in [41-42] 
old days the flock of Agvan Catholicos are thought to be Armenians and having mixed with them adopted 
their character. 
    The Armenians also had unintentional, forced interbreeding with other peoples. Persian hordes, 
Azerbaijan Tatars, the Turks, the Georgians and mountaineers, perhaps, did not stand upon ceremony with 
women of the nation, for long time having lost their Statehood and connected with it methods of proud and 
courageous self-defence. 
   Under such conditions it is clear that in the Armenian's veins there is a mixed blood. This accounts for 
the circumstance that the nation, whose cowardice in Near Asia became a proverb, from time to time produces 
talented and courageous generals as a bright exception on the dark background and it is clear that they have the 
blood of other martial peoples. But a pure-blooded Armenian , according to the Caucasian proverb existing in 
 21
some local languages , "is afraid of hares". No doubt, this feature is Semitic. In general, the Armenian nation has 
any amount of peculiar Semitic features, such as historical inability to the least stable state system, gradual 
disappearance of any authoritative ancestral aristocracy, long- standing transition to the underground policy of 
theocratic system , distinctive features of collectivism in utilization of areas requiring irrigation and a 
considerable race inclination to trade, usury and, in general, to insatiable grabbing. Arrogance and cruelty 
towards the weakest and slave servility before the strong and, at last, striking , phenomenal ability to 
advertisement and insatiable vanity - all these are the Jewish features, only the Armenians have them in more 
rough and intensive form. 
    The Armenians don't like very much to be compared with the Jews and instruct their protectors not to 
lose any chance of speaking as actively as possible about Aryan origin of Gaikanian, nation. Perhaps, forseeing 
such facts a Georgian proverb says: "Only a slave should contend, when he is ordered, that apples grow in the 
oak." 
   Alas, not few of such slaves can be found in our day of worship to the golden calf among employees, 
publicists and even scientists. 
   In addition to this, a lack of information is extremely spread among us concerning the Caucasus and its 
tribes, - and besides self-confident and irritating those who know their trade. By the way, that is what Warsaw. 
Honored professor D.I.Azarevich, whom 1 don't know personally, wrote to me concerning recent articles by 
Mr.Syromvalnikov: "Having no library at hand [42-43] 
I'll only remind you that at the last archaeological Congress in Moscow the anthropological department 
under the chairmanship of Virkhov listened to the report delivered by one Frenchman (it seems to me that his 
name is Fig'e) on the Armenians' semantism. It is not difficult to find the proceedings of the congress in the 
Imperial public library the report itself." 
    The honorable professor, I hope he won't consider it the immodesty that I refer to his authority, must 
have been confused by the careless treatment of science on the part of two brave protectors of the Armenians 
from suspicion of semitism. Some excuse for the latter can be a direct indication of the dictionary by Brockgauz 
and Efron to the fact that "the Armenians is a branch of Iran group of Indo-European tribe". But in this case you 
can hardly forget the expression: "calendars talk nonsense" successfully applied in particular to the dictionaries 
published by Jews... 
     It is noteworthy here that the Armenian maecenas from oil industrialists take much care of creation 
quite special Armenia history, of glorifying this small nation and its heroes ranging from chance generals 
deserving respect to not chance smugglers of any kind deserving... respect but from the other side. In particular, 
they don't lose a chance to put forward their historical "deserts" and present-day virtues in the parasitic way, i.e. 
at same time cast aspersions on the neighbor nations, who had more clear, undoubtful and worthy history. 
     In the historical-archaeological field they rob the Georgians in.the most shameless manner: they 
scratch away the Georgian inscriptions from the monuments, abandon ancient Orthodox chapels and deserted 
churches, invent historical nonsense and refer to as ancient Armenian estates sucfi regions, where every stone 
says about the past of the Georgian kingdom. 
     The first hireling of Armenians in the Russian literature was Senkovsky who , under the pseudonym of 
baron Brambeus, has written such things. Then - the Armenian "historians ". Emin (Moisei Khorensky's history) 
Khudabashev (Review of Armenia), later Eritsov ("The Caucasian old times", 1972, No.l) despite such 
significant witnesses of the past as monuments, worked in the same direction: for example, they tried to deprive 
Georgia of historical rights for the region Saatabago, i.e. atabek Jakeli's estates, now Akhaltsikh. Every 
Caucasian knows that in this district there are distinct traces for residence of tsaritsa Tamara the Great, that the 
Muslim population of the district consists of Turkishnized Georgians speaking Geor- [43-44] 
gian, and that the Armenians appeared there in a large number in the first half of the XIX century as the 
refugees from Turkey but not as the natives. 
    Professor Patkanov, a specialist in the Armenian philology, (the same professor, to whose Gypsy origin 
was pointed in the Armenian newspaper "The Murch") was also little ashamed of the facts citing such imaginary 
scientists as Senkovsky , travelling botanist Kokh, et al. Georgian writer Bakradze in proper time exposed him 
well, but that discussion did not reach greater part of the Russian Society; Patkanov's follower, Mr. Marr misses 
no opportunity to cut something from the Georgians in favor of Armenians and still promises to prove lhat a 
remarkable ancient Georgian poem "Panther's Skin" is an adopted work. . It is desirable for Armenian 
politicians because the Armenians have no and never had for the time of their being some great poetical 
composition, i.e. one of the obvious signs for flourishing of national spirit. 
    However hard these more zealous than talented literature nestlings like Jury Veselovsky and so on may 
try to convince the Russian public in existence of good Armenian literature they are still a long way from 
babble, as no matter how hard try, from nothing you can get only nothing. 
    A certain Mr. Ezov composed a book phenomenal in its impudence "Relations of Peter the Great with 
the Armenian people", where, regardless of common sense, he assigned some special diplomatic significance to 
 22
unfamiliar rogue Israel Ory, making an attempt to involve Peter the Great in the war with Persia just at the 
highest point of his war with Sweden, - thus Mr.Ezov from everywhere draws the quotations unfavourable for 
the Georgians and for the sake of this he goes too far. The same quotations are tendentiously thrust on a reader 
in the philanthropic collection "Fraternal help to the Armenians suffered from Turkey" with the epigraphy from 
Gladstone: "kindness, kindness and ... kindness! The kindness turned out to be rather biting, in the Armenian 
style. 
     Well-known Georgian poet and publicist Ilia Chavchavadze dedicated his very interesting booklet 
("Armenian men of wisdom and screaming stones") to this lie, to all these historical-archaeological 
encroachments and rapines of the Armenians. This booklet has been translated into Russian and is rich in 
characteristic facts. 
   In Tiflis while speaking of Georgian-Armenian intertribal relations, they mention correspondent of "The 
Temp", certain Kutuli.  He had scarcely ar- [44-45] 
rived in Tiflis when he was taken by a sly humpback, talented political propagandist Artsruni, the editor-
publisher of newspaper "The Mshak" 
     Armenian rich men began to humor and overfeed Kutuli, not letting him stir a step from their side. He 
completely lost his ability to look at the surroundings with his own eyes. The matter took such a turn that all 
beautiful women whom he met on his way were given out to be Armenian but ugly -Georgian. It was so comic 
that even the Georgians whose historical-archaeological self-respect was extremely sensitive, couldn't be cross 
when reading travel notes of trustful or complaisant Frenchman. 
It was very funny to see not long ago how the Armenian politicians and "makers of history" tried to 
seduce French scientist, baron de Bye, who had written a lot about Russia and how they were surprised at their 
failure. 
    He visited, by the way, Echmiadzin, the capital of the Armenian Catholicos, where he was shown some 
very old things: some crowns, cups, embroidered cloaks, etc. The experienced archaeologist noticed at once a 
great inaccuracy of chronological data given by the Armenians and not without humor he expressed it in press. 
It appeared, by the way, that some imaginary ancient patterns related to the decay of rococo style. The rage of 
local Armenian newspapers printed in Russian letters came to indecency. 
    Armenians morbid self-respect, vanity and the inclination to advertise their grandeur in the past and at 
present are explained and partly justified by the fact that they for many centuries have won bad reputation of 
which they wanted to get rid. 
   Impartial, humane and moral Tatsit, who can praise the enemies of Rome , the Germans, says the 
following: about Armenians in his well-known work: "... from time immemorial it is double-faced nation, both 
in character and in geographical situation". In book 12, paragraph 46 he indicates: "rather notorious treachery of 
the Armenians". 
   Out of numerous examples of such outrageous facts we cite two cases taking place during two month. 
"The Caucasus", 1897 June. 
  The parishioners of Dushet Church of St.Nickolas passed sentence, according to which two persons of 
them had to solicit the higher Caucasian authorities to take measures against appropriation by the Armenian 
clergy of the chapel "Bodavis-tsminda Georgis-kishi" with a plot of land belonging to it (within 1/2 verst of 
Dushet). The ancient icons out of this chapel were [45-46] 
stolen long ago and transferred to the Dushct Armenian church, the plot was joined to it in "unknown 
ways" on the 15-th of May and the chapel itself was renamed into "Surn-Geurk" and the orthodox priests were 
not allowed to serve there. 
   "Iveria", April 1897. Akhaltsykh. 
   Nor far from the city, on the other side of the Notskhovi river there is a medicinal spring, the water of 
which wonderfully cures headache. For a long time beside the spring there was a Georgian chapel and a small 
cell. The medicative properties of this spring were well-known, so sick people from various part of Georgia 
came there and recovered. 
   The water was used free of charge but in the chapel there had been piled up a lot of voluntary gifts. At 
the beginning of last March somebody put Armenian icons in the chapel, made the doors to it, locked them and 
took the keys away. Local clergyman D.Khakhutov reported about this appropriation to the Georgia ekzarkh. 
   "You are a slave, you are a coward, you are an Armenian" - said Pushkin by the words of an old 
mountaineer's mouth. 
("Tatsit", 1928, St.Petersburg.) 
   The Georgian people say: "an Armenian has come and brought misfortune". As regards the forcing out 
of Georgian nobles by Armenian tradesmen a number of popular provcrs have appeared: "thoroughbred horses 
have died out - expanse was left for asses", "a foreign hen drove out a stay-at-home hen out of its house", etc. 
   The Caucasian Tatars say: "set fire to your ten fingers like candles to light the way to an Armenian he 
won't thank you." 
 23
    For a long time Russian people are prone to call Armenians by humiliating names, expressing in them 
either disdain, or mockery . Nekrasov, a progressive and humane poet says: 
To fiance having a high rank 
She refused being cross with him, 
And to some Armenian 
She was married in church 
Without any permission. [46-47] 
 
   Not less humane Zhemchuzhnikov (Kozma Prutkov) sings like this: 
In the narrow-bed 
I am lying alone 
In the next ward 
An Armenian is shouting. 
   The word "to shout" is very typical of them: they are just inclined to shout in any case. It they are not 
allowed to come to somebody else's house if some of their tricks arc exposed or some thieves from their 
surroundings arc prosecuted - they not only shout but make foreigners, silly or mercenary people shout. 
   Our impartial fiction treats Armenians badly. In Leskov's "Soboryane", for example, there is a 
blackmailer Ter-Moscsov with developed hips. 
  France and Germany where there are Armenian "revolutionary" circles and where using Baku oil-
industrialists' money the strenuous propaganda in Armenian's favour is taking place people who are to the 
slightest degree acquainted with this question and besides impartial ones raise their voice against the latters. 
Count de-Shole, a French traveller throughout Armenia, Kurdistan and Mesopotamiya describing the life of 
these Turkish provinces with great skill and indignant at brutal treatment of Moslems to the mass of Armenian 
people, says about Armenians: "and nevertheless despite great compassion aroused in me by their poverty and 
sufferings, I could never become attached to them, so disgustful it was their trickery , so shameful.it was their 
meanness and so disgraceful it was their baseness." 
   Alfred Kerte , a German traveller in his "Anatoly sketches" which are dedicated to Kol'mar fon-der-
Golts, a German statesman in Turkey and where the author wouldn't dare to talk idly, says the following: 
"Almost everybody who deals with the main body of people, learns to respect the Turks, to put the Greeks 
in a mean position and to despise the Armenians... Everywhere the proverb proves to be true that a Greek can 
[47-48] 
deceive two Jews, but an Armenian- two Creeks. You can surely say that if you are cheated somewhere in 
Anatoly, - it means, you have dealt with the Armenians." 
   The same author cites the words of a big contractor in Eski-Shekhire: "When I agree on business with a 
Turk I can manage without a contract in written form, - his word is sufficient. With a Greek or any Levantin I 
have written contract as it is necessary and useful with them. But with the Armenians I have no business even in 
written form because even a written contract doesn't protect you against their falsity and intrigues." 
   Strictly speaking, the intelligent Armenians are for a long time aware that the reputation of their tribal 
name is unflattering. Not without reason only some time ago they tried to give themselves out before the people 
not acquainted with the Caucasus to be the Georgians and sometimes "Circassians" for some poetry. Up to now 
both they and publicists sympathize with them and are apt, where it is possible, to substitute the word 
"Armenian" by the words "aborigine", "Caucasian" and "Christianian", in particular this stress of "Christianity" 
is very typical both because the Armenians arc not against to enrich themselves at the expence of their 
neighbours - Moslems and as the name "Cristian" gives them a privileged position and very suitable for them in 
cases when comparison of them with Jews inevitably rises in the mind. 
   But they have so many Jewish features that if all the scientists of the world erroneously identified them 
with Aryans, the life itself would be indignant at such definition. 
   However inexact the written history of Armenia it is, there is much typical and instructive in it both in 
high familiarity of the narrators' tone and in the facts as well. 
   From Catholicos Ioann VI and to the latest time 
("The history of Armenia from origin of the universe to 925", translated into French by Sen-Marten) - the 
Armenian historians have a claim on the accuracy of information dated back to the fairytale period. The 
Armenians, they say, descend from Noi; his great grandson and Iaphet's grand-son was mythical Gaik. 
According to the Armenian Arcbishop Iosif who dedicated his book to Emperor Paul I - "the most reliable 
narration on the genealogy of Armenian tribe grandparents says like  that: Noi gave [48-49] 
birth to Aphet, Aphet gave birth to Homer , Homer - to Tiras , Tiras to Torkom, Torkom gave birth to 
Gaik, who together with Nemvrod undertook the babel so far as he didn't want to acknowledge Nemvrod's 
supreme power, lie returned to his land, Nemvrod declared war, in which Gaik defeated and killed Nemvrod. 
 24
That's why the people obeying Gaik and considering him to be their father and sovereign came to be called from 
his name as Gaikans." 
    Then it follows a number of such true and proved facts. The pages of history abound with "great" 
names, unfamiliar to any historians but Armenian and sometimes the figures of less dubious origin appear but 
greatly enlarged. If, besides the word fabrication, one needed lo write in Scriptures of the Armenian history the 
word exactly characterizing true facts, then "betrayal" couldn't be avoided. The dubious rulers of Armenia, the 
country with constantly changing frontiers, always depend on mighty neighboring monarchies and 
systematically betray them. Nobles (nokharars) betray tsars, people both. Cruelty of customs and unreliability of 
mutual relations arc phenomenal. As soon as the Persians, Romans, Arabs nominate somebody as a ruler of 
Armenia, this ruler starts to prepare a rebellion at once. 
  The Armenia itself, i.e. in the Armenian plateau any independent kingdom was abolished rather long 
ago, in the V-th century, when Armenia openly became the Persian province and, in fact, the theocracy with 
Catholicos at the head was established over the Armenian people as the nearest and organized power. Since that 
time the Armenian bosses, so to say, have trade in two directions: they sell their homeland and people 
sometimes to the Persians, then to Moslems, in general, sometimes to Byzantine and in an underhand way they 
conduct their line of struggle for trivial originality. 
   Some illusion of Statehood appeared at the end of the XI-th century in small Kilikiya and dispersed 
completely in 1375. 
    And, at last, here are some extracts out of memoirs of tsarist army officer, lieutenant-colonel 
Tverdokhlebov, later on the recommendation by Marshal of the Soviet Union Shaposhnikov joining the Red 
Army. These evidences are of special value, as the author was in the very midst of terrible and blood-shed 
events. It is true, he hasn't been stigmatized yet next in turn mark on the part of notorious Armenian authors of 
mythical, the so- [49-50] 
called, "genocide" enlarging with every day to immense dimensions. We shall note only the fact that the 
final pari of edition of memoirs by generals Odshelidze, Przhevalsky and Lebedinsky published in 1920 - 1925 
in Paris have been bought and destroyed by "Gnchak" and "Dashnaktsutyun" party members. 
   In the nearest future the author will be able to publish these historical documents as well by the amiable 
consent of London national library workers, presented microfilms from these books. 
   In the book of the authors mentioned above it is quite distinctly described the true picture of Armenian 
"genocide" in 1915. The whole world, the representatives of Europe and America having arrived in Turkey in 
1915 - 1916 with a great bias looked for the traces of notorious "genocide" to see with their own eyes and by 
means of Turkey discreditation to separate it once and for ever, because by the beginning of the II-nd century 
the Ottoman Empire was one of the largest and most powerful states in the world having its estates in three parts 
of the world. In Asia the Peninsula of Asia the Minor and all its South-Western part up to the Persia frontiers 
belonged to it, in Africa - all Northern sea coast including Algeria, Tunis, present-day Libya, Egypt and Sudan. 
In Europe all the Balkan Peninsula area belonged Turkey. It is quite natural that it was just the place where the 
interests coincided for England, France, Italy and Germany who often organized the crusades against Turkey. 
    "The very fact of being more than 100 projects to separate Turkey shows that all the countries of 
Europe had definite predatory plans concerning it. Ottoman Empire joined the World War not at once but after 
hesitations for a long time. On the Caucasian front it had to start fighting against Russian troops, in 
Mesopotamia and Ramst front - against English, in Syria - against French and in the Dardanelles - against the 
united Fleet of England and France and against land forces of these both countries." 
( N.Sokolsky. "Essays of the Present-day Turkey", Tiflis, 1923, p.7-11). 
    And when Russian troops of the First Caucasian army crossed the borders of Turkey on November 4, 
1914 the numerous Armenian committees of "Gnchak" party in the rear of Turkish troops began to arrange 
disorders, robbery, murders of peaceful people, attacks on State officers, mosques, etc. [50-51] 
     Under such critical conditions, when the appeals to the Armenian leaders had no any positive effect but 
aroused a new tide of violence, the decision was taken and the Government sent a part of troops against armed 
Armenian bands, at the same time having deported the Armenian and Kurd population inland, in the direction of 
Mesopotamia, as the bandits made short work not only of the Turks and Kurds but those Armenians as well who 
did not want to join their gangs. It was December 1914 and the beginning of 1915. 
    Alas, representatives of the European countries have not found "genocide" traces but most of them 
published in the pages of their newspapers and magazines information entitled "Armenians' crimes against 
peaceful inhabitants", "Murderous actions of Armenians in Erzerum", "Andronik is a werewolf", "Erzrum is a 
butchery", etc. 
    Here are some dates: 
Russian troops cross the Turkey border - November 4, 1914. 
Capture of Kepri-kei (Erzerum region) - November 7-8, 1914 
 25
Great victory of Russians near Sarykamysh (Armenian attribute this event to themselves. - A.M.) - 
January 3-4, 1915. 
Capture of Artvin and final retreat of Turks to the West - March 29, 1915. 
Capture of Erzerum - February 16, 1916. 
Occupation of Isfagan (Iran) -March 17, 1916. 
Capture of Trapezund -April 18, 1916. 
Victories of Russians in Khoy and Dilman regions, general attack between Van and Urmy lakes - May 2-
3, 1916. 
Capture of Erzidzhan -June 25, 1916. 
Capture of Mush - August 23, 1916. 
    Despite all reactionary character of the tsarist government and sympathies of some Russian circles to 
Armenians neither in a single newspaper nor in one document there was something reminding "genocide". 
There was none cither within next 50 years, though numerous attempts of chauvinists-bosses of "Armenian 
question" failed. Everybody needed facts [51-52] 
and only facls, which were abscnl. They will "appear" only in 1965-1989. But for the present we shall go 
back to Colonel Tverdokhlebov: 
    "In the middle of December, 1917 the Caucasian Russian Army left the battle-front without permission 
and agreement of Army commander and Commander-in-chief. 
   Erzerum fortress artillery regiment left together with them. From Erzerum artillery there have been 
stayed only officers from artillery department of the fortified position of Erzerum and Deve-Boinu and 40 
officers from the artillery regiment. These officers stayed to do their official duty near their cannons left by 
Russian soldiers. The rest officers have gone away. There were above 400 cannons in the fortified positions. 
They had no forces to withdraw these cannons, so they were attached to the position and the officers were 
attached to the cannons and stayed to wait when the Army Commander would give them an order to go away or 
give new soldiers. 
   At the same time, instead of the first regiment left it was formed the 2-nd Erzcrum fortress artillery 
regiment from the officers who stayed . 
   After leaving the front by the army, it was organized in Erzerum in the revolutionary way, the Armenian 
union which called itself "the Union of Armenian Soldiers". It gave to the Army Commander for the new 
artillery regiment about 400 quite untrained Armenians. Part of these people ran away at once but the rest were 
only sufficient to guard batteries in the position. 
   Some time before leaving of the battle-front by the army, just when the Civil War broke out in the 
Northern Caucasus and the Transcaucasus appeared to be cut from Russia, in Tiflis the Provincial government 
was formed that assumed the name the Transcaucasian Commissariat. This Commissariat declared that it was 
not separate independent government but only temporarily, and took place until the order restoration and that 
the Transcaucasus continued to be the part of Russia. 
   By the Decree on December 18, 1917 the Commissariat declared that instead of the army left there 
would be formed a new army and the national indication would be taken as its basis: there must be formed the 
Russian, Georgian, Armenian, Moslem corps and military units of other smaller nationalities - Greek, Aisor, 
Ossctic, etc. [52-53] 
     The artillery of fortified position of Erzerum and Deve-Boinu remained mixed until clearing up the 
question concerning its nationality. Almost all commanders were the Russians but the soldiers - the Armenians. 
The Commander of Artillery, Commander of regiment and main military cadres were the Russians, so nobody 
could think this artillery to be Armenian. Nobody has given an order to consider this artillery to be Armenian; it 
continued to have its previous Russian name. All of us served in it as in Russian artillery, we got our salary out 
of Russian Treasury, we obeyed to the Russian Army Commander and Commander-in-Chief, at the regiment we 
had the Russian but not the Armenian church and a Russian priest. 
    Nearly two months have passed since Russian troops' leaving. During this time there was no 
reinforcement, troops of other nationalities did not come to Erzerum either. The discipline was bad in the 
regiment, soldiers kept deserting, robbing civilians and even began to threaten openly the officers and disobey 
them. 
   The Colonel Torkom was nominated as a chief of Erzerum city garnizon; I heard he was Bulgarian 
Armenian - Torkomyan. 
   In the middle of January some soldiers of one of the Armenian infantry parts at night arranged robbery 
of one of the distinguished and very respected Turkish citizens of Erzerum and killed him; his surname I don't 
remember. 
  The Army Commander general Odshelidze gathered all the commanders of separate parts and very 
strictly demanded to find the murderer in three days; he told officers that such actions of soldiers Armenians 
disgraced the whole Armenian nation and the honour of the Armenian people, required to find the committers of 
 26
the crime; at the same time, he demanded to stop any outrages and violence, otherwise he would have to 
distribute arms to the Moslem population for the self-defence. Colonel Torkom felt hurt and answered that the 
whole Armenian nation was not like that at all, that some rascal robbers could not be reproach for all people's 
honour. 
  The Commanders of parts asked the Army Commander to introduce disciplinary regulations, drumhead 
court martial and death penalty. The Army Commander answered that it was beyond his power to do the latter 
but he had already applied for the disciplinary regulations. 
   Whether they have found the murderer or not - I don't know. [53-54] 
   By the end of January, if I am not mistaken on the 25th, Torkom organized parade of the garnizon 
troops with a ceremonial church service and salute of 21 cannon shots; he explained this by the necessity to 
encourage the garnizon and to show their power to the citizens. In parade, in the presence of the Army 
Commander, general Odshelidze, he read from the paper some speech in Armenian, which we didn't understand 
at all. 
    It turned out that colonel Torkom, as I had been told, proclaimed Armenia autonomy and himself as its 
reigning ruler. Having found it the Army Commander made him leave Erzerum. From this fact we understood 
that the authorities regarded any independence of Armenians as unconceivable. More than once I heard how the 
Armenian leaders were being instructed by officers of the Army Commander Staff that all equipment accepted 
by the Armenians from the Russian army in various store houses of Erzerum, its neighborhood and on the front 
- had not been transferred to the possession of the Armenian people at all but only temporarily passed to them 
for the superintendence, deposit and upkeeping due to the absence of another troops. 
   At the same time, rumors reached us that in Erzidzhan Armenians had committed the slaughter of 
civilians with all kinds of atrocity and then ran away from the Turkish troops attacking Erzidzhan. According to 
the Army Commander's and arriving officers' information there have been slaughtered about 800 Turks but from 
Armenians only one-has been killed during the Turkish self-defence. It became known that in Ilidzhe village, 
not far from Erzerum, unarmed city dwellers have also been massacred. 
   On the 7th of November, in the afternoon I paid attention that in the streets the militia and soldiers were 
taking away Turkish men somewhere. Answering my question they explained that these men were being taken 
away to clean the snow-bound railway tracks. 
   By three o'clock in the afternoon over the telephone one of the Russian officers of my regiment the 
second lieutenant Lipsky reported that in the barrack of my regiment some soldiers Armenians had caught hold 
of six Turks in the street, had driven them into corner of the yard and were beating them, may be, they would 
kill them. He couldn't help them himself as the soldiers threatened him with weapons for his wish to release the 
Turks and an officer armenian who was present there refused to counteract them.[54-55] 
   At once I gathered three officers living, next door to me and went to set the Turks free. Not far from the 
barrack I was met by the officer who had reported to me over the telephone and a representative of Erzerum 
municipal department Starovsky who was looking for his acquaintance Turk. 
  They informed that soldiers prevented them from coming into the yard. We went on. When we were 
approaching the barrack, about twelve frightened Turks ran out of the gates and scattered in all directions. We 
managed to detain one of them but without interpreter we couldn't interrogate him. I entered the yard of barrack 
without difficulty and demanded from the soldiers to show where the Turks were. I was told that there was 
nobody in the barrack. Having started the search I found at once above seventy terribly frightened Turks locked 
in the bath-house at the barrack. I held a short inquiry on the spot, arrested six Armenian soldiers, whom almost 
everybody pointed to as leaders and set free all the Turks. 
   At the same time I found out that side by side with the barrack an unknown Armenian soldier killed one 
sick beggar, without any reason. 
    Unfortunately, the records of all this with the names of people set free by me together with other papers 
of the artillery department were lost on the capture of Erzerum on the 27-th of February, by Turkish troops. 
Who of city dwellers were seized then - can be established by means of inquest of population, as even now in 
the street of the city I meet people whom I set free and who always express their gratitude for saving of their 
lives. Interpreter Ali-bei Pepenov knows them as well, he used to be a clerk and at that time, made lists with 
their names for records. 
   The inquest showed that Armenian officer Karagadaev was involved in this crime, according to the 
released Turks, he had guided their search and some things taken away by soldiers he had appropriated. 
Karagadaev was also arrested and put into guard-room until the day of his trial. 
    In the evening all this was reported to the Army Commander in the presence of the district Commissar 
Glotov and his assistant Starodsky. 
   During this day the Armenians have performed some single murders and the arson of one market place. 
All in all, over this period from various places of the city and its outskirts the information was received on the 
murdering of innocent Turks by Armenians. [55-56] 
 27
    The turkish citizens said that out of Turks who had been sent to work many of them didn't come back at 
all but disappeared somewhere. 
   The next day after this event we, the senior gunners, the chief of mobilization part of artillery 
department and me-gave the report of the Army Commander with a request to allow all the artillery men of the 
fortified position of Erzerum to leave Erzerum because we were quite useless there as wc couldn't resist the 
brutality of Armenians but to cover Armenian's outrages by their names they didn't want for a single minute. 
    From the Army Commander we found out that the Turkish army Commander, general Vekhib-pasha 
informed him by the radio-telegram on his order to the troops to occupy Erzindzhan and to advance on the 
territory having been occupied by the Russians up to the meeting with the Russian army , as the Armenians 
were committing atrocities and massacres in these districts among Turkish peaceable population. 
    In response to this the Transcaucasian Commissariat proposed to Turkey to conclude peace. The 
Turkish Army Commander answered by the radio telegram that he together with his army had accepted this 
peace proposal gladly, but a final decision depended on the Turkish government whom he had reported about 
this proposal. 
    At our request the Army Commander spoke over the telegraph with the Commissariat chairman 
Gegechkory and Commander-in-Chief general Lebedinsky. In answer they reported that doctor Zavriev and 
Antranik (read Andranik-pasha -A.M.) had been sent to Erzerum to set up order, that the Armenian national 
Council had been made an ultimatum demand to stop immediately all disgraceful things and it was in their 
power: that a final instruction would be given after getting a final reply on peace from the Turkish government 
but up to now we should stay in Erzerum. In conclusion they told us: "We want to express our deep gratitude to 
you and all officers for you common heroic deeds: we are completely convinced that you and all your 
colleagues will make one heroic effort more, when new disasters threaten to Russia." 
    After this the Army Commander issued an order in the written form that everybody had to stay at his 
post like sentries, that he had too much power and applying it he would let none of us to be killed for nothing. 
    This ,we have stayed in Erzerum again at the request of the Russian authorities and in favor of Russia. 
At this time it became known that the [56-57] 
Turkish government agreed to carry on peace talks with the Transcaucasian Commissariat: Trapezund was 
fixed as the place of talks, the beginning of talks was scheduled for February 17. 
    Orally the army Commander explained us that we had to stay in Erzerum up to the conclusion of peace, 
then in dependence on conditions of peace we either should have to evacuate from Erzerum all our artillery, 
with all stores or to give it to the Turkish army on the spot, if there was such condition of the peace talk 
.otherwise, we should have to destroy all cannons and to leave Erzerum ,as the Army Commander, wasn't going 
to have any battles near Erzerum in case of this necessity we should be informed seven days before. 
    But, in general, before a final decision of the question on our staying in Erzerum we shall have to 
defend Erzerum against possible attacks of Kurds, because even during the conclusion of a truce, the Turkish 
government announced that the Kurds didn't obey them. 
   With that end in view, as far back as the end of December by the order of the Army Commander the 
cannons were sent to halting places on the line Erzerum-Erzindzhan to drive Kurds away who began to attack 
these halting places to gel some food from storehouses. There have been sent some of such cannons a couple of 
them per a hailing place, together with officers. These cannons retreated with the troops having retreated from 
Erzindzhan and consisted mostly of Armenians. 
    By February 10 with the same aim to beat off the Kurdish band's attacks the Army Commander ordered 
to move two cannons in Beyuk-Kiremitli, over Trapezund gates and in Surb-Nishan. Later their number was 
increased by adding some cannons more in different places of the city. 
   All these cannons were put only against the Kurds, they were put quite openly and to fight with the 
regular forces, equipped with artillery, certainly, wc could not as wc would be shot down after two or three 
shots: but wc could repulse the Kurd's attacks successfully. 
   On February 12 in the railway station a crowd of armed to the tenth Armenian soldiers killed ten or 
twelve Turks. Two Russian officers happened to be there and made an attempt to prevent them from such 
atrocity ,but the brutal crowd reacted this by the threat to deal with them in the similar way. We failed to detain 
some of them. 
   On February 13 the Army Commander declared in Erzerum a state of siege and drumhead court martial 
following old, prerevolutionary Rules, i.e. [57-58] 
with application of death penalty: He nominated colonel Morel to the post of Erzerum fortress 
commandant and somebody of Armenians as the chairman of tribunal, but he himself went away that very day. 
Together with him the Commander of artillery of fortified position, Major-general Gerasimov has left to prepare 
the military base in case of artillery evacuation. I stayed to act as the Commander of Artillery of position. 
 28
   Colonel Morel's staff for the most part consisted of Russian officers. Just after the Army Commander's 
departure colonel Morel changed his tone. He declared that Erzerum garrison would stay there and defend it to 
the last, he would let go none of the officers capable of carrying weapon. 
    On the first day after the Army Commander's departure I told the colonel Morel at the council of war 
that there were officers who wanted to go away-an Erzerum commissary Sogomonyan, an Armenian, allowed 
himself to declare alout and frankly that he ,as a member of tribunal, would shoot everybody if he tried to leave: 
that in Gasan-Kale and Kepri-Kee powerful piquets had been set, they would keep off and send back those who 
wanted to go away without any permission. 
   I saw that we had been caught in a trap, and it would be difficult to get out of it. It was clear that a state 
of siege and drumhead court martial were directed more against Russians than against Armenians behaving with 
brutality. 
   Acts of violence haven't been ceased in the city. Russian officers invariably remained the protectors of 
defenseless peaceable Turkish people. There were cases when my subordinate officers by force set free the 
Turks being seized and robbed in the streets. Promises to execute rascals killing unarmed civilians have not 
been kept. Drumhead court martial didn't act-they were afraid of Armenian soldiers threats. Not a single 
Armenian guilty of the crime was hanged as it had been promised before the introduction of drumhead court 
martial. Meanwhile, it were Armenians who mainly and persistently insisted on this drumhead court martial. 
    The Turkish citizen said that the Armenians never executed an Armenian. We also have seen that the 
following Russian proverb demonstrated its value in practice: "Dog doesn't eat dog". Healthy Armenians 
capable of carrying arms went away to accompany their running families. [58-59] 
    Arrested ensign Karagadaev has been free without my permission. To irty question about it colonel 
Morel answered that they had prosecuted an inquiry and he turned out to be not guilty; meanwhile, at this 
inquiry nobody of us was interrogated, neither I nor other officers, though we were the main witnesses of that 
affair. 
   One more murderer arrested by me has not been put to trial cither, at least 1 know nothing concerning 
his taking to count. 
   Colonel Morel began to fear the revolt to Moslem population of Erzerum city. 
   On February, 17 Antranik (the same bloody Andranik-A.M.) came to Erzerum together with assistant of 
general-commissar of occupied region doctor Zavriev. 
    As we have never been interested in the history of Armenia and its internal political life, nobody of us 
knew that Antranik was a Turkish citizen and had been sentenced to death as a robber by the Turkish 
government. All this I found only from talk with the Commander of Turkish army on March7. 
    Antranik came wearing the uniform of major-general with the Fourth Class Order of St. Vladimir, 
Second Class Georgy Cross given for services in battles. The Chief of his Staff,armcd Forces Staff of Russian 
service colonel Zinkevich arrived in Erzerum together with him. 
   Before Antranik's arrival a telegram from him was received and published by Morel saying that in 
Kepri-Kee machine-guns had been put which would shoot all cowards running from Erzerum. 
   As soon as Antranik came to Erzerum he began to act as the Commandant of fortress, colonel Morel 
became his subordinate and we remained under Morel's command in a previous way. 
   On the day of Antranik's arrival one of my officers informed me that in Tada-Kei village the Armenians 
massacred all the armless civilian population without distinction in sex and age. I told Antranik about this on the 
very first acquaintance with him. In my presence he ordered to send twenty housemen to Tapa-Kee to catch at 
least one commiter of crime. Whether it has been performed and with what result I don't know yet. 
   Colonel Torkom appeared again. In a couple of days after Antranik, the colonel of artillery Dolukhanov, 
an Armenian, came to Erzerum. First I was said that he would be an inspector of artillery and my chief. After 
my [59-60] 
statement that I having the rights of division Commander object to any guardianship upon me and I shall 
have to go away immediately-the order has been given that Colonel Dolukhanov is trusted with organization of 
the artillery business of Erzerum fortress. 
   He began to be occupied with this and gave orders to me not on his behalf but on behalf of Antranik. 
   It became evident that Armenians under cover of this wish to serve to the benefit of Russia wanted to 
seize all the constitutive power in their hands but to leave dirty executive job to the Russian officers. 
   It was fell that the affair was coming not to the advantage of Russia but to independence of Armenians 
by Russian officer's hands: they tried to do their best not to show openly as in this case all Russian officers of 
artillery or most of them would go away immediately but they had none of their own. 
   The Armenians were afraid of artillery men's leaving. For example captain Plata, the acting commander 
of the Caucasian battery 4, told me the following case: On February 4 it was planned to send the mountain 
artillery from Erzerum to Sarykamysh. The Armenian leaders having learned about it, on February 5 in panic 
arrested the Commander of regiment of mountain battery: by the order of the Army Commander this officer was 
 29
set free: after it he was seized three-times, they threatened to flood all Erzerum with blood, in case if mountain 
artillery tried to leave Erzerum Certainly, they meant to shed Russian officer's blood. Every time the arrested 
officer was released following the instruction of the Russian staff officers. The Army Commander annulled 
sending of mountain artillery. 
   This event made me come to an agreement with acting Commander of mountain battery 7. Forseeing 
possible physical outrages upon Russian artillery officers after the army Commander's leaving ,we agreed to 
hold out a helping hand to each other, if the Armenians dared to raise their hands against us or our officers for 
purpose to compel us to serve Armenians' interests. It is natural , our agreement was secret. The real force in our 
hands were cannons, machine-guns and Russian officers. 
  At that time, following my advice captain Plata has located his officers nearer to our flats. As to me, 
from the very beginning of regiment formation I began to concentrate everything in the regiment nearer to the 
artillery department in the Moslem part of the city since the first day of Russian troops' coming to Erzerum. [60-
61] 
   With Antranik's arrival to Erzerum in the staff of colonel Morel the fear of citizens' revolt increased. 
   This fear grew every day. In three days nftcr Antranik's arrival I received an order from colonel Morel 
to appoint some experienced officers for firing at the Moslem part of the city from Medzhidie fort in case of 
uprising. All of us were ordered to move from the Moslem part of the city to the Armenian. We, the Russian 
officers, living side by side with Moslems for almost two years and knowing them perfectly did not believe in 
possibility of revolt and made fun of Armenian cowardice. 
   The artillery officers ,of course, openly declared that they refused to fire at the city as they served not 
for shooting guns at the peaceable city drivellers, women and children, but for honest fighting with an enemy; 
however, the present slate of affairs is such that they easily expect the Armenians their fear or by some reason to 
see an armed revolt in the place, where there is none and will demand to open fire. 
   We did not move from the Moslem part of the city because it was physically impossible to move for 
such a short period of time, second, because our moving would leave Armenians free to commit massacre in this 
part of the city and, third, because of moving there we would finally fall into Armenian's hands whom we didn't 
believe any more. 
  Colonel Morel's instruction on a possible fire at the city excited officers and made me organize general 
meeting of the artillery officers under my command. 
   The general meeting of officers took place in two stages with a break of one day between them. At the 
first sitting there have been present: artillery officers of the Erzerum fortified position, artillery officers of all 
other garrison parts, two English officers being present al that time in Erserum for some days, then colonel 
Morel, colonel Torkom, Antranik and doctor Zaviev. The English have been invited as people free of the 
Armenian influence and being able after their departure to inform the rear of front staff and foreign military 
missions on the mood of artillery officers and their relation towards Armenian murderous intentions. 
   Especially for the reason that I had neither post-office nor telegraph at my disposal and I couldn't be 
sure that my telegrams would reach their destination. To be more exact,1 was quite sure (hat my telegrams 
would not be delivered. [61-62] 
    At the meeting I gave a detailed account of situation and reasons of Russian artillery officers' presence 
in Erzerum ,I informed the meeting in every detail on all Armenian outrages and atrocity known to me from my 
personal observations,  from  stories  of the Army  Commander,  general  Odshelidzc. 
   I finished my report with a distinctly expressed thought that we are Russian officers and stayed in 
Erzerum not to use our name and uniform as a cover of the Armenian murderous deeds upon defenseless 
population: we stayed to serve Russia ,devoted to our duty and obedient to your Commanders: we stayed to 
serve Russian affair, but not Armenian massacre and robbery and in no case we were going to stain our good 
name throughout the world : but while we arc here, we demand to put an end to Armenian disgraceful practices, 
otherwise we'll insist on our immediate  departure. 
   Other officers confirmed my statement. Antranik answered that the Armenian people were indebted to 
Russia and they were only a part of great Russian nation and wanted to help Russia without any thoughts of 
separation from it. He added that massacre was the result of everlasting hostility of the Armenians with the 
Turks, that all disgraceful practices and outrages would be stopped and in future the violence upon the civilians 
was out of question: that he came there to put an end to all shocking things and he failcd-hc would leave this 
place the first. 
   The conversion took place with help of an interpreter. To the question whether those officers who 
wished could leave Erzerum, he replied that if weak-spirited people went, it would be for the better and he 
would "try" not to prevent them from going away. 
   Colonel Zenkevich persuaded everybody who was present that the cause we stayed to serve was Russian 
and he applied himself to it believing it. 
 30
   In conclusion the officers expressed their wish or intention to wait for seven or even tcntJays to sec if 
Antranik's promises were right, to sec their importance and to act according the situation. 
   It was February 20 or 21. After this meeting colonel Dolukhanov told me that he was astonished at that 
hatred which Russian officers had towards Armenians and was surprised at the reason of their hatred. The same 
he told some other officers as well. [62-63] 
    Antranik gave an order that everyone regardless of his nationality would be equally responsible for 
every murder. Notices were put up all over the city inviting citizens to open shops and to work without any fear 
as for murdering of every Turk taken to work the whole escort accompanying him would answer with their lives 
etc. The very next day after it I and one of my battalion commanders, an Armenian Junior captain 
Dzhanpoladyants rode on horseback in the street past the municipality. We saw a crowd of Turks, reading a 
notice and wc stopped. Junior captain Dzhanpoladyants explained to the people in Turkish that the authorities 
were taking every measure not to allow outrages upon the civilian Turkish population on the part of Armenian 
soldiers and if the inhabitants did not revolt no harm would be done to them. 
    People answered that for two years they had not any revolt and they weren't going to rise it and their 
only request not to offend them. 
   I asked Dzhanpoladyants to explain to people that I, a Russian Commander of artillery regiment, and all 
the Russian officers had always been and would be in future defenders of the peaceable Turkish population and 
we took every measure and did everything in our power not to allow violence and would require this from the 
authorities in future. 
   Many of them confirmed that knew about that and two or three men certified a fact that I had saved their 
lives. On February 7 Dzhanpoladyants took part in the work of the Armenian Committee. 
   At the second sitting of the general meeting of officers only doctor Zakiev was present out of outsiders. 
It has been told here that the 2-nd Erzerum Fortress artillery regiment is not Armenian as mercenaries and 
nobody has such a wish. We have made neither a sighed statement nor contract to serve in Armenian troops. 
The government must determine exactly whether this regiment Russian or Armenian: if it is Armenian ,they 
should allow Russian officers to go away to Russian corps but those who don't want to serve on the Caucasian 
front should be allowed to go to the Military command without consideration of the state of siege, that is the 
only formal obstacle. 
   In case of the Transcaucasus is separated from Russia, the news has already reached us that it is 
expected one of these days, we must go away immediately as in such state of affairs wc become foreigners in 
the Transcaucasus. It was found out that according to the existing decrees and orders everybody had a right to 
give report to be discharged to the Military [63-64] 
Command or to be transferred to a Russian corps. I declared that I should not delay these reports and 
should solicit for their execution. 
    At this meeting an officer of the 7-th Caucasian mountain artillery battalion junior captain Ermolov 
informed the officers society that he having no wish to serve in a newly formed Armenian battalion had sent in 
his papers with request to be discharged:first he was persuaded to stay and when be refused- Colonel Morel 
issued a written order that Ermolov was discharged to be at the disposal of the staff "according to the lack of 
correspondence", i.e. differently speaking, as quite unfit and harmful for service. Besides, he was given an order 
to leave Erzerum during 24 hours. 
   So they have treated a fighting officer ,with a perfect knowledge of his affairs and having several 
decorations for services in battles: they discredited him only for his act that he didn't want to join up in the 
Armenian military unit and has carelessness as to tell colonel Morel some words exposing him in his excessive 
devotion to Armenians. 
   Doctor Zavriev at this meeting convinced the officers' society that being in Erzerum they did purely 
Russian affair and only for the benefit of Russia but not the Armenian one; that the Armenian people were much 
obliged to Russia and in future they would be able to exist only under the protection of Russia; that the 
Armenians by no means intended to be separated from Russia; that the Armenian people was a part of Russian 
nation; that the economical and political interests of Russia persistently demand our staying in Erzerum till 
making peace; that morally as Russian citizens ,we can't say: "You, the Armenians and Turks settle your scores. 
Are you committing slaughter? Well, go on doing it. Damn you, it is your home affair and we Russians, have 
nothing to do here". 
   At last, if we are so philanthropic and demand so persistently to put an end to massacres of innocent 
people, then this philanthropy obliges us to stay in Erzerum not to allow the brutal Armenian rabble to commit 
massacre of Moslem population. 
   Doctor Zavriev's speech was a failure. After meeting he told me that the matter was hopeless and all the 
officers would probably go away. 
 31
   In ten days, after Erzerum seizure by Turks I had a chance to read some paper from which I understood 
that our apprehensions concerning organization of Armenian autonomy by the Russian officers' hands were not 
groundless at all: in this paper doctor Zavriev says quite definitely to [64-65] 
arrange the Autonomous Armenia This document dates back to the time before doctor Zavricv's arrival in 
Erzcrum. 
   In his estimation of officers' mood doctor Zavriev was not mistaken. In fact, their desire to leave was on 
hand. It was clear what the Russian officers were needed for. We have always been only soldiers and we had no 
wish to deal with politics. 
   We couldn't think that the Armenians partisan war was our affair. 
    Antranik's promises remained only promises. People didn't believe them. The markets were closed. 
Everybody was afraid. In streets in the Moslem part of the city there was dead silence; only near the 
municipality some shops were open and some Moslems gathered in the afternoon. Not a single Armenian has 
been executed: "There is nobody to be blamed: show us who is in fault and he will answer for it; how can we 
punish, if we don't know who is guilty". 
    They have been immediately replied that Russian officer pointed many times to the committers of 
crime, who go unpunished up to now, that Russian officers aren't obliged to be the Armenian criminal 
investigation department and if Armenian actually wanted to find faulty, they would find by all means a lot of 
them long ago. 
   The Armenians alienated us by their hypocrisy even more. Separate violence upon civilians didn't cease, 
only they were performed more secretly: the Armenians transferred their actions from the city to villages which 
were out of our sight. From the villages the Turks disappeared: I don't know how and where; and in the distant 
they began to defend themselves using weapon. 
   In the city under the pretence of counteraction a revolt the city dwellers began to be arrested. To my 
question to Colonel Morel - to what extend the life of arrested people was safe and if those arrests were not 
aimed at the organized massacre of people like sheep in the same way as in Erzindzhan. He answered that the 
arrested leaders of the supposed Turkish revolt would be taken to the far rear, Tiflis, safe and sound and some 
part of them would be kept like hostages as a firm guarantee against the uprising. I began to receive reports on 
unlawful actions of the Armenian supplying offices; for example, they refused to give butler to feed regiment 
people; if the request was made for electrical company and the sergeant major of this company being on friendly 
terms with Anlranik went to get it, then butter was given [65-66] 
by all means; grocery manager an Armenian, didn't issue sugar by the request to the regiment for that 
reason that Antranik had concentrated the whole sugar in his flat and regulated its issue himself. 
   During this period of time reinforcement from the rear was poor. The infantry being on hand was 
completely demoralized and obeyed neither his senior nor junior commanders. Infantry companies before 
Antranik's arrival refused to go to the positions and did not go; at present they went but ran away from the front 
in disgrace. Antranik himself drove them back to the positions with the help of his sword and fists. It was a petty 
adventure in which the Russian officers were kept under compulsion. I don't know may be Antranik was very 
experienced in the art of war but his orders concerning the artillery part transmitted to me by Colonel 
Dolukhanov very often stroke me by their absurdity. 
    It was evident that the Armenians headed by Antranik set their hopes on the Russian guns and Russian 
artillery officers taking into consideration neither technical aspect of the matter nor such a fact that near these 
guns there should be a well-trained personnel, good junior officers and soldiers and, first of all sufficient 
quantity of good and powerful infantry. 
   The main intention was clear: to cover the retreat in a rout. In fact, that was the case. The beginning of 
peace talks was put off. First it was scheduled for February 17, then February 20 and, at last, for the 25-th in old 
style. Such information we had through the staff of Erzerum detachment or fortress. I had no telegraph 
communication of my own. My staffs were in the opposite part of the city. Telephone communication with the 
fortress staff was very often out of order, so I had to be in the fortress staff 
personally twice a day. 
    According to the information received from Colonel Morel and his Staff-it could be seen that on the 
front we dealt not with regular Turkish troops, but with the Kurdish bands and inhabitants of neighbouring 
villages who rose in rebellion. Among them there had to be many well-trained soldiers stayed there after 
retreating of the Turkish army from Erzerum in 1916. They were supposed to be organized for self-defence and 
were trained by some Turkish officers and soldiers-instructors who came there. 
    They had only two cannons left by the army when retreating from Erzindzhan. According to the 
intelligence service the Kurds had to advance [66-67] 
in Fam, Erzindzhan and Olt directions. Colonel Morel thought the main danger to be in Oil direction. 
   The intelligence service, in my opinion, was awfully carried out by the Armenians. 
 32
   The Horse was occupied more with robbery or murdering people in villages, stealing cattle of villages 
but not with intelligence at all. 
   They often told lies in their dispatches. If it was reported that the detachment was being attacked by two 
thousand enemy then, in fact, it proved to be less than two hundred. One day an Armenian officer reported lo 
me over telephone that a detachment of four hundred armed people was approaching the battle part of artillery 
where he was billeted together with the soldiers guards keeping watch over cannons; in fact, it turned out that 
two men without arms went out of the opposite village and soon they returned. 
   After the second silling of the General meeting of officers I have been given some reports on discharge 
from the regiment to the Russian corps, to military commanders and other national units. 
   I informed Colonel Morel that probably many Russian officers and may be all of them would leave 
Erzerum. He got angry and said he would not allow this by force and drumhead court martial. I told him that 
cannons were still in my officers' hands and reply to violence could be made out of a cannon and under existing 
conditions every officer's leaving was a juridical right of everybody based on the government decrees. 
   I explained that none of officers wanted to leave unwarranted: everybody wished to have lawful 
permission to enjoy his right; otherwise they thought there would be no difference between them who stayed to 
do their duty and those who had left earlier unwarranted. 
   Colonel Morel replied that they had not any juridical right for leaving and he would give the same 
recommendation to everyone as he had given to Junior-Captain Ermolov, let them just make an attempt to leave. 
   After my objection that if was unnecessary to compel staying those who did not want, as according to 
Dolukhanov, in Tiflis and Batumi there were many wishing officers - Colonel Morel said he had already asked 
English officers who visited Erzerum to send sixty English artillery officers at his disposal and it had been 
promised to him. Almost at the same time with this talk I found out that one soldier, Russian or Pole, serving at 
the Erzerum [67-68] 
railway station as a civilian did not want to stay, he was arrested and compelled to stay by force. 
   Before leaving I asked junior captain Ermolov to visit Army staff Commander Vyshinsky in 
Sarakamysh and to tell him under what conditions we lived and to ask the Army Commander to set us free as 
soon as possible out of our false position among Armenians. Just the same I asked to tell the artillery 
Commander, General Gerasimov. Ermolov went away on February 25. 
   It seems to me, on February 24 a Turkish aeroplane appeared over Erzerum. Having made 
reconnaissance it went back. From this I drew a conclusion that Turkish regular troops had to be in Erzindzhan 
or even in Mamakhatun of that moment. 
   By that time Colonel Morel told me that the Turks had sent "a leaflet" with demand to leave Erzerum. 
After Erzerum seizure talking with corps commander Kyazimbei Karabekir I found out that it was not a leaflet 
at all but the most real letter signed by him, the Commander of Turkish regular army corps. 
    If a leaflet is looked upon in our society as an anonymous illegal letter, then in any case I think that 
Colonel Morel had no right and did not have to lead me into error and to call an official letter as a leaflet making 
a secret of the fact that it had been signed by the great commander of Turkish regular military forces. 
    According to the fortress staff information on February 24 and 25 the situation on the front was not 
precarious. It was known that near Teke Deresi a gathering of Kurds had been discovered who were held out by 
a detachment sent there. Beside Ilidzhi the troops from Erzerum threw the enemy, they said, some versts back. 
    On February 26 I learned that the Armenian detachment which went out of Erzerum to Teke Deresi had 
been surrounded, defeated and the survivors were running in disgrace; that Ilidzhi detachment was also 
retreating in a hurry. I received the oral order from Colonel Morel to open fire at the attackers. But there were 
not any attackers. From the Kharput highway broken ranks of retreating Armenians were running in panic ; 
along the Trapezund highway they retreated quietly, as if in march, in columns without stopping and turning. 
[68-69] 
 
   In the afternoon I found out that the enemy was within six versts, near Geza village, and soon the 
attackers themselves were seen, who were not more than one thousand and a half in my opinion. 
   The number was insignificant but they did not produce an impression on me of quite untrained Kurdish 
band. It was evident that they were well-trained and led by somebody. 
   But those who were retreating made a miserable and outrageously disgustful impression. They either 
scattered beside the highway in short thin lines or gathered again: it was seen that their principal feelings were 
fear and a dread of advancing. Antranik rode out in front of this line: they got up, walked a little forward, then 
dropped flat and did not set up any more. 
   The gun fire lasted up until the evening and was over at nightfall. It goes without saying that right from 
the start of defence from Kurd invasion any talk of learning was put aside and every officer honestly performed 
his functions required by field conditions. 
 33
   It was clear to everybody that to go away at that moment-it meant -to acquire the name of a coward and 
traitor. First we had to put an end to attacks. That day I paid attention to the fact that the soldiers running in 
panic nevertheless did not forget to steal cattle to lake people away from the villages and to kill single local 
people without weapon on their way. 
   Enemy's approach to the city appeared to be unexpected for the staff. There was not any disposition for 
the battle, may be there was, I cannot assure you, but I haven't seen it. I heard that an order of battle had been 
drawn up for the infantry in case of outside alarm but it did not fall into my hands either 
   My task was simple to hold up the Kurds within gun fire distance from the city fortification line. In the 
field together with infantry there were mountain cannons but they were not under my command. All day round 
and the day before in the city militia gathered not only men, the Turks able to work but old people and cripples 
as well. The militia explained that they gathered workers for cleaning snow-bound railway track. 
   In the evening I learned that one of such patrols under an Armenian student's command in the daytime, 
in my absence, made an attempt to break into my flat, though there was my visiting-card on the door and that 
student couldn't help knowing who lived there. After resolute rebuff on the [69-70] 
part of my people at home that student insulted my wife and then he and his company got away yet 
without my landlord, an old Turk and some workers-Kurds. According to the student's words this outrage was 
committed by Antranik's order. 
  After that incident I asked my landlord to make passage from his place to my flat for possible moving 
under my protection in case, if Armenians came to take the inhabitants away. 
  In the evening on that very day.I was called to the council of war in Antranik's flat. I went there together 
with head of technical and mobilization part, captain Zholkevich, whom lately I always invited with me to have 
an eye-witness of my actions. 
   When 1 arrived I learned that the Council had already taken place without me. My opinion was 
evidently not interesting to be taken into account. In the room there were: Antranik, doctor Zavriev, Colonels 
Zinkevich. Morel, Dolukhanov and some other persons. Colonel Zinkevich read the Army Commander's 
telegram to me. In this telegram Odshelidze reported that the turkish army Commander-General Vekhib-pasha 
by his radio-telegram informed him of his order to the Turkish troops to start attacking Erzerum and occupy it; 
General Odshelidze added his order to destroy all the guns of the fortified position and retreat. 
   I was given a written order signed by Antranik to destroy all the guns. General Odshelidzc kept his 
promise to give an order of destroying guns, but his order was late: some part of them could not be destroyed, as 
they were cut off from us by attackers; but more than half was still in our hands, which we could destroy. 
   The whole time Antranik shouted, cursed and damned somebody in Armenian. Doctor Zavriev tried to 
calm him and interpreted to us that Antranik was cursing those leaders and statesmen of the Armenian people 
who established themselves firmly in the rear; who had a chance to send tens of thousands of soldiers to 
Erzerum but up to now they had sent only three or four thousand; who did not want to go to the front and who 
had sold Armenian people. 
   At last Antranik announced his decision: for two days more to hold out in Erzerum; during this time to 
evacuate everything that was possible and then to retreat. After this feeling no shy before us, in our presence he 
took off his [70-71] 
clothes, washed, put on his night shirt and went to bed as if we were not present there at all. 
   I told doctor Zavriev that in the city there were arsons and fires; I informed him that on my way I had 
just seen a number of burning shops and nobody was extinguishing the fire; he answered that the measures had 
already been taken and an order had been given to put out fires. 
  Then I asked him why the militia took away Moslem citizens; he said that for cleaning railway track and 
then to my surprise-why they gathered at night, in the darkness and they took away mainly old people and 
cripples unable to work-he answered he knew nothing but promised to make inquiries about it. 
  After all those conversations with doctor Zavriev on the question of violence upon civilians I thought I 
had said much enough to rouse his anxiety and to tlake care of not letting massacre, as being a member of 
government he always demanded and tried to set the most blameless and natural relation of the Armenians 
towards Moslems. 
   Such relation I noticed not only on his part but on the part of some other persons of the Armenian 
intelligentsia in Erzerum, I do not know what was in the back of their minds and at the bottom of their hearts but 
the words of some persons always made an impression of sincere, noble intention not to allow disgraceful 
practices and slaughter. 
   Other Armenian's instincts doctor Zavriev had to know better than me. When Antranik was going to bed 
we moved to another room, clarified some questions connected with solution of the problem raised by Andranik 
and went away. 
  The task to hold out for two days was not something supernatural and extraordinary, as we had wire 
entanglements with perfect entrenchments in front of us, then the city fortress fence and, at last defensible forces 
 34
two or three times larger and it was easy to hold not two but forty two days and not only against Kurdish raids 
but against regular troops as well. 
   We were quite right to beat off an attack of Kurds , as the Turkish government when concluding a truce 
declared that the Kurds did not obey them and they could not make them to be at peace. Thus, we ourselves 
were entrusted with the care of our guard and defence. [71-72] 
   On my way back I saw that the fires spoken about me had been really put out and their spreading was 
limited. Judging by outer look it was still quiet in the city and nothing excited apprehension of possible 
massacre. 
   I returned home by two o'clock a. m. and went to bed. Between 2 and 3 o'clock a. m. I heard frequent 
rifle shots in the city; I heard somebody breaking doors by the blows of log: I heard footfall and voices of small 
Armenian detachments passing by in the streets like those which had appeared in the daytime and taken away 
people. No shouts for help were heard anywhere. It made an impression on me that the Armenians were making 
arrests among population but, may be, were preparing massacre. 
   Comparing and weighing all circumstances I have made a conclusion that: first, while we fighting 
against attackers in an honest battle and defending Erzerum with might and main - behind our backs the 
Armenians, these bloodthirsty and cowardly fighters for freedom, already begin to slaughter defenseless old 
people, woman and children, not in the least worrying that by these acts they meanly deceive us and disgrace 
not only themselves all over the world but disgrace the name of a Russian officer, about whom uninformed 
people can think that they agreed to help Armenians in their infamous deeds; second, among attackers there can 
be now the Turkish regular forces and if they have not come yet, they can come by the morning or in the 
afternoon: but a battle with the Turkish regular forces does not enter into plans of the Army Commander and 
into our task. 
    Accordingly, I made up my mind to come up to colonel Morel at day break and suggested that he 
should demand from the Armenians to stop the slaughter at once: if he fails to achieve this I shall offer to turn a 
part of cannons against the Armenians and by threat or, if necessary, by fire to make them doing so; then to 
cease fighting, send some truce envoys and to agree with the attackers that Erzerum will be evacuated within 2 
days without bloodshed. 
   To guarantee the Moslem population's safety on retreating of Armenians some plan should be 
developed, for example, to gather an independent detachment from Russian officers, some Russian officials and 
soldiers: or to help Russian officers and to give a small detachment of Turks at their disposal, etc. 
   At dawn captain Zholtkevich and I went to colonel Morel's place. On our way there, near the artillery 
field deport I learned from the manager of  [72-73] 
supplies, ensign Bagratunyants that an order had been received for retreat and he was going to blow up the 
depot but colonel Morel told him to act according to my wish. 
   I was surprised at such words as this depot was not under my command but colonel Dolukhanov's. 
   I explained to Bagratunyants that the explosion of depot was unnecessary and aimless cruelty towards 
civilian population of the city and a- criminal betrayal towards us - Russian as we knew nothing of the retreat 
order yet; all of us were near by the depot and inevitably we should have to die on explosion. My words had an 
effect on him and the depot remained. 
   Driving up to the Morel's staff I saw everybody running. Opposite the staff a house of American 
consulate, where some Armenian officers were placed, was on fire and in flames. In front of the staff there was 
a lorry and some carriages loaded up to the top and ready for leaving. Colonel Morel and Torkom were on 
horsebacks, ready for departure as well. It was about 7 o'clock p. m. 
   In reply to my question, what the situation was and what they were planning to do colonel Morel said 
that he had already given the order to retreat at 5 o'clock p. m. and was surprised why I had not received it yet. 
   It was the very case that I was afraid of, they were running using Russian officers and cannons as a 
cover. While Russians were charging and pointing guns in battle holding attackers, Armenian "warriors"werc 
committing slaughters behind their back and were running away safely. If I had not come myself, nobody of us 
would have learned that the order about retreating was given long ago. Before this, in cases much less important 
I was often informed even by he officer but this time they could do nothing of the kind.                                                        
   My first intention was to go to Medzhidie fortification and from that place "to thank" running along the 
Kars highway Armenian heroes by shrapnel fire for that they having deceived us, did not let me and my officers 
realize our task of destroying guns: that they had organized a disgustful robbery and for that they also deceived 
me, an old fighting officer and my subordinates. What kept me from doing this it is my understanding that 
among them quite innocent people will suffer; 
   In Erzerum there still stayed rather many Russian people, people of other nationalities, women and 
children. We went back immediately to the [73-74] 
artillery department, the streets were packed with crowds of running panic-striken Armenian soldiers. I 
haven't seen officers, the road was all over strewn with things thrown when running - greatcoats, accoutrements 
 35
and food. It was impossible to drive through the avalanche of running people and carriages, we wanted to go by 
some other streets and turned aside, but we were met with a severe small arms fire and human shouts. What was 
taking place in the street we could not see-the turn of the street was flooded with blood. I decided that a battle 
had already been begun there and ordered to turn back. Having driven to the cross-road we left our carriages and 
went half way on foul. At this time from the street where the fire and screaming were taking place, the chief of 
the town militia, an Armenian,   drove out, and I understood what the matter was. Later my supposition was 
confirmed. Having returned to the department I asked to give my order to the batteries to retreat together with 
infantry. I also ordered to provide the artillery officers with transport for leaving. But some time later I was 
reported that the transport of artillery department due to the Commander's carelessness had run away at night 
and the regiment transport, on which an officer was on duty at night, had just run away. 
   Seized by terrible fear the Armenian soldiers running along the streets took away these vans, sat down 
on them and drove on. Sometimes they unharnessed horses, mounted in pairs on them and in panic rode horses 
hard out of the city. They also tried to lake away the carriage abandoned by me in the street and when my 
coachman showed rcsistancc-thcy began to shoot at him, wounded one of the horses but they had not taken our 
carriage yet. 
   Out of all transport where there were about fifty vehicles, I was lucky to keep a couple of vans. Some 
officers used them, they loaded them in a haste and drove away. 
   Two carts and two phaetons more were left: I could make an attempt to use them and go away but at 
that time running Armenians opened the unsystematic, frequent and disorderly fire at the empty streets left by 
them: willy-milly we had to give up our intentions and to hide in the house. 
   The Turks guaranteed safely from the Kurds to us and our families. Afterwards it turned out that if we 
had tried to drive away, in spite the Armenian's fire at the city, we would not have succeeded as Kars gates were 
cut off at that time: junior captain Mitrofanov made such an attempt but had [74-75] 
to return despite the fact that he lived not far from these gates. Soon it became known that the Turkish 
troops had already marched into the city and only at that moment I found out that we dealt not only with the 
Kurds but with regular troops as well, that almost all the Armenian brave infantry at night, under cover of 
darkness ran away from the battle-field and hurried to save themselves.Their running had a hurricane character. 
No hurricane could  clear Erzerum  of Armenians so quickly as  they had cleared  it themselves. The fact that on 
defence lines and in the city there were almost neither killed nor wounded Armenians best of all showed how 
hard they defended themselves and how long they resisted: but the second fact that almost only Russian artillery 
officers have been taken prisoners testified not worse to the level of valour and nobility of Armenians.Having 
got an information on marching of regular troops into Erzerum, my aide-de-camp and I went to tell that we had 
been there, at that moment we learned about conclusion of peace between Russia and Turkey. 
  On our way there and back and the next days as well many townspeople hurried to me, kissed my hands 
and thanked me. they treated other Russian officers in the same way as they knew that if there had not been 
Russian officers in Erzerum, the Turkish troops would hardly have found so many alive there.Now, when I 
know that Armenians have done before their running away and how many defenseless old people, women and 
children they have killed I am grateful to God for such concurrence of circumstances that did nol allow me to go 
away together wilh those about whom old Roman Petrony wrote: 
   "Armenians are also people but at home they go on all fours" and whom Russian poet Pushkin 
characterized so neatly in his poems: "You are a slave, you are a coward, you are an Armenian" 
April 16/29, 1918. Erzerum. 
               Acting artillery Commander of the fortified position of Erzerum and Deve-Boinu and      
Commander of the 2-nd fortress artillery' regiment, prisoner of war Lieutenant-Colonel Tverdokhlebov". 
  Haven't these criminal murderous actions of "valiant'Armenian "patriots" of 1915-1919 anything in 
common with the events of 1988-1990. [75-76]

   More than 800 years ago the Armenians found shelter on the territory of modern Turkey, Iran and lived 
peacefully and quietly. They were mainly busy with usury, trade and brokering. By the beginning of the XlX-th 
century the Armenian aristocracy was formed , who enjoyed complete trust of governments and all the comforts 
of life. But the working people lived in complete agreement with the neighboring Turks, Kurds and Iranians.

    "Looking back at the history one can say with certainly that from the very beginning , we, the 
Armenians, have been instigated by the tsarist autocracy, Russian patriarchate...". 
    Present-day actions of such Armenian werewolves was Sero Khanzadyan, Bagrat Ulubabyan, 
Aleksandr Ambartsumyan, Victor Ambartsumyan, Vardges Petrosyan, Silva Kaputikyan, Karen Demirchyan, 
Sergo Mikoyan, deputies of Soviet parliament Zory Balayan, Genrikh Pogosyan, as well as Dadamyan, Ignatyan 
and many others are not accidential and under conditions of all-round support on the part of imperialistic circles, 
CIA and widespread diaspora are direct continuation of purposeful policy which was begun in the middle of the 
XIX century. 
    It would be naive to suppose that the anti-soviet and anti-national campaign of the Armenian 
chauvinists and extremists is some natural and spontaneous process. Not on the least! First by historical 
examples they set up "lobby", then by their provocative publications they attracted attention of uninformed 
public and having prepared public opinion they began active robbery attacks against authorities, open genocide 
of the peoples living on lands belonging to them since olden days. Every time they failed. And only in 1988-
1990 they succeeded and on what scales! And where has all this happened? I wonder ,how V.I.Lenin, the leader 
of the world proletariat, would appraise the treacherous fascist actions of Epigons of dashnaks, gnchakists and 
ramkarvars with the Communists party card? I think that very simple - counter-revolution! 
   It is striking that Alma-ata, Sumgait and Tbilisi events have been nipped in the bud, but in Erevan and 
Stepanakert at somebody's evil wish not only are not stopped but are systematically encouraged in order not to 
let the fog of lie and falsification clear away. 
    It is probably difficult to suspect ex-president of the USA R.Reigan and his assistant of their antipathy 
to the Armenians. It is very interesting his position stipulated by his ardent wish to win on the president 
elections. To collect more votes he in the year of president elections (April 15, 1980) and during the first period 
of his presidency (April 22, 1981) condemned "genocide" of 1915. However after his consolidation R.Reigan 
and the USA State Department under pressure of the broad public coast doubt on the fact of genocide, that made 
angry the Armenian circles in the USA. After this an [84-85] 
attempt has been made on his life! Afterwards all the influential and powerful Armenian circles of the 
USA organized obstruction to the President whom they hated. 
    Not a single country in the world, despite vain attempts of the Armenian history falsificators could 
admit the fact of genocide. It was the case in the USSR. And only in the time of L.Brezhnev, under great 
pressure of a A.Mikoyan and his associates the General Secretary during his visit to Erevan thanks to the 
importunity of his daughter Galina and being tipsy, he waved his hand: "A memorial? Well, put it!" It was 
enough in no time to rouse the memorial to victimes of genocide." And when in Moscow he was pointed out the 
 40
fatal consequences of his thoughtlessness, he being a little frightened said: Well, what is to be done, won't we 
pull it down?" Thus, "genocide" was legalized in the center of Erevan in 1965. And this memorial has played 
not the last part in speculation of young people already without any morals and ideals. 
     Acquaintance with historical facts shows that 1988-1990 events in Armenia and Stepanakert are an 
exact copy of 1890-1920 events. For more than 30 years, since 1880 the Armenian extremists carried out a 
crippling movement for achieving their aims and they attained it in 1918 when dashnak Armenia was 
established. Then for more than 60 years disguised enemies of the Soviet power have been going to the idea of 
"Great Armenia"and only after 1985, namely in 1988-1989 they attained a wide turn of known events with the 
help of some leaders of the country and large Moscow "lobby". 
    So in 1887 it was organized the Armenian petty-bourgeois party "Gnchak", "the Social-democratic 
party Gnchak". It was founded in Geneva by Aventig Nazarbekyan (Nazarbek, Lorents). Maro Vardanyan, 
Georg Garadzhanyan, Gabriel Kafyan and Ruben Khanazatyan (Khanazet). Their main program and aim was to 
exterminate the Turkish and Kurd population of Erzerum, Van, Zeitun, Sasun, Erzindzhan and other regions of 
compact residence of Armenians, on the territory of Turkey and as a part of it to make "Great Armenia" with a 
prospect to annex Erivan province, Karabakh, Zangezur, Kazakh, Akhalkatsi and some other lands of 
Azerbaijan and Georgia to it. 
   It is noteworthy that for 3 years the largest revolt of Armenians in Zeitun and Sasun (1890-1892), when 
as a result of actions of the Armenian armed [85-86] 
detachments about 65 thousand of unarmed Moslems - the Turks and Kurds were murdered. Terror-
stricken peasants, old people, women and children, inhabitants of villages could do nothing with the well-
trained and well-armed Armenian fighting men, at the head of whom there were officers of tsarist army and the 
Turkish citizens of Armenian origin. 
   The Turkish government made a protest to the tsarist autocracy and to governments of England, France 
and the USA and declared martial low in these regions. Many prominent leaders of "the Gnchak" were afraid 
unmasking and had to emigrate to Geneva and other European cities and later they joined RSDRP. 
It is interesting that V.I.Lenin long before 1917 being acquainted with "the Gnchak" leaders through their 
publications including S.Shaumyan as well, wrote to Russia from Geneva : 
    "I especially warn you about "the Armenian Social -Democratic federation". If you agreed to its 
participation in conference you had made a fatal mistake, which must be corrected by all means. It is a pair of 
Geneva desorganizers publishing here trifles without any serious relations in the Caucasus. This is a Bund 
creature, specially invented for feeding of the Caucasian Buddism. If you allow this public to be present at the 
Russian conference, i.e. conference of organizations working in Russia, you will get into a mess. All the 
Caucasian comrades are against this band of literary men-disorganizers (I know this from many people). You 
will only give rise to the protest of the Caucasus and a new squabble instead of "Unification". For goodness 
sake, now it is possible to ignore the Caucasian Union, thousands working in Russia and to keep company with 
scums of the Geneva sloughll implore you tearfully: Don't do this!" 
(Complete works by V.I.Lenin, ed.5, v.47, page 64) 
    In 1890 in Tiflis Khristofor Mikaelyan, Simon Zavaryan and Stefan Zaryan founded the bourgeois-
nationalistic party "the Dashnaktsutyn" - "the Armenian Revolutionary Union". 
   Out of large-scale aims of the party it has been partly achieved only one -when in Baku S.Shaumyan, 
A.Mikoyan and dashnak Tatevos Amirov declared the Soviet power with the help of inveterate ruffians-
Mauserists Amazasp and Dro and dashnak-army of 5 thousand people. In this period more [86-87] 
that 250 thousand of people from Baku, Shemakha, Kuba and neighboring villages have been massacred 
and murdered. From Baku A. Mikoyan and his assistant Tatevos Amirov have stolen 20 million roubles of 
public money in gold. 
   To understand the liberal and patient relation towards actions of Armenian extremists of those days 
during 1890-1916 one can trace step by step the contemporary events, i.e. visible part of the Armenian "iceberg'. 
   On February 20, 1988 a special session of the Soviet of people's deputies of NKAR adopted 
unanimously the decision: "On application to the Supreme Soviet of the Azerbaijan SSR and Armenian SSR for 
the handing over of NKAR from the Azerbaijan SSR to the Armenian SSR". 
   While the Azerbaijan leaders being at a loss were slow to grasp"what is to be done" (they got 
accustomed to do nothing), in Moscow the officials understood that a chain reaction can be started in the 
country and on February 21 in the evening Demichev and Rasumovsky arrived in Baku in a hurry. Meanwhile 
Erevan - Stepanakert airway increased a number of routes greatly. Weapons and ammunition were carried, 
artists-designers and experienced instigators arrived there to excite people for going on strikes, uprisals against 
officials and for deportation of the Azerbaijanians from Stepanakert and Askeran. 
   Arrival of alternate members of the political Bureau of the CPSU Central Committee in Khankendy 
(now Stepanakert) on February 22, 1988 somehow damped the extremist's ardour and in a shock slate they 
approved a resolution at the meeting of Nagorny Karabakh regional party organization on February 22 , 1988. It 
 41
ran: "THE TASK IS THAT THE PARTY ORGANIZATIONS OF THE REGION AND THE MOST ACTIVE 
MEMBERS OF IDEOLOGICAL INSTITUTIONS WOULD PLACE THE WORK ON A BROAD FOOTING 
IN MASSES, LABUOR COLLECTIVES CONCERNING QUESTIONS RESULTING FROM RESOLUTION 
OF THE CPSU CENTRAL COMMITTEE, WOULD BRING DIRECTIONS OF THIS DOCUMENT TO 
TOILER'S MIND AND HEART AND ACHIEVE THE SOONEST NORMALIZATION OF SITUATION". 
   The next day at the plenary Session of the Nagorny Karabakh Regional Party Committee where it was 
elected as the First Secretary G.Pogosyan, a righ-hand man of the former leader of (he Regional Party 
organization, [87-88] 
member of "Karabakh" committee and "the Dashnaktsutyun" party B.Kevorkov. A real face of the 1-st 
secretary was unmasked at the session of the USSR Supreme Soviet on July 18, 1988, when he with undisguised 
impudence, on the ground of fabricated historical facts demanded in the ultimatum form to transfer NKAR to 
Armenia. By the way , in the fit of fervour Pogosyan admitted that economically the region lives better than 
Azerbaijan! 
    I had a chance to speak to many people of Armenian nationality in Stepanakert and Askeran. Their 
judgments are different but opinions are the same: To speak frankly, in spite of Boris Stepananovich Kevorkov's 
support, we were afraid that we should be make answerable and so our "struggle" for just solution of "Karabakh 
question" would be suppressed. 
   When we saw that we were persuaded, asked and somehow even bewared, we plucked, our courage. We 
were especially bold when our comrades came from Moscow, namely: Deputy chief of International 
Department of the CPSU Central Committee Brutents academician Khachaturov, Chief of civil defence courses 
of the USSR Defence Ministry, general Arutynov, ct al. who passed the words of support on the part of Moscow 
comrades and assistant of the General Secretary of CPSU Central Committee academician Shakhnazarov (read 
Shakhnazaryan-A. M.) 
   But meanwhile ring-leaders of the "question" from Erevan and foreign countries understood well that 
they must not let put out "the bonfire" and just because of this the Republican Parly active of Armenia together 
with Vazgen I on February 23-24, 1988 being not ashamed of alternate members „ of Polit-bureau of the CPSU 
Central Committee V. Dolgikh and Secretary of CPSU Central Committee A.Luk'yanov began to persuade all 
the population of Armenia. 
   Simultaneously a plan has been developed of mass scale beating of the Azerbaijanians in Armenia and 
first hundreds of outraged, robbed and half-naked families fled away to Azerbaijan, they began to appear in 
Kazakh, Kirovabad, Mingechaur, Baku, Sumgait, arousing people's anger, accumulating fair indignation. 
Armenian ring-leaders understood well that they needed such action, which could distract public opinion from 
their foul plans and somehow justify their behavior. The Armenian fellows, speaking fine Azerbaijan, well-
armed, supplied wilh money and narcotics were trans- [88-89] 
ferred to Sumgait in a hurry. These "landing party" began pogroms first themselves and then having 
stuffed young people of the city with narcotics set them on the Armenian housing estates. 
   A familiar handwriting! 
   On February 25 in Askeran (NKAR) Deputy chief of militia, an Armenian, quite openly murdered two 
Azerbaijan fellows. In Baku, on March 3, 1988, a dweller of Khutor, Armenian in sight of numb people out of 
sporting gun shot a militiaman-Azerbaijanian, guarding Armenian's rest. 
  Tension was increasing. The Azerbaijan population was bewildered-where are officials? Why are not 
draslic measures taken?Why are not the address of the General Secretary of CPSU Central Committee and 
Resolution of CPSU Central Committee Politbureau concerning this question confirmed by concrete actions and 
do not dump ardour in Erevan and Stepanakert? 
   The fact irritated that talking profusely about support of the principal and true position of CPSU Central 
Committee, the leaders of one republic continued their criminal extremist policy, those of another showed 
complete helplessness and confusion. 
   Having studied the cowardice and helplessness of the Azerbaijan leaders of those days the way out was 
found - Sumgait! The city where social injustice has been concentrated, where people for years lived in hovels, 
breathed in chemicals and children were born with defects.         
  Raging of banditism lasted not for a long time, as M.S. Gorbachev said, the curfew was only 4 hours 
late. 
  One of pogrom organizer Grigoryan was caught red-handed when he hav-I ing raped an Armenian girl 
was cutting her to pieces, the second - Muradyan  escaped. The leaders of Republic allowed general Arutynov 
freely go about  peaces including Baku, Stepanakert, Askeran, Martuni, Gadrut and after it he was given 
possibly to leave for Moscow. 
  If the government had taken severe measures since the very first minutes of the developing events, there 
would have been neither beating of Azerbaijanians in Stepanakert, murdering of Azerbaijanians in Askeran, nor 
 42
attacks on Khodzhaly, raging of imported from Erevan and Stepanakert banditism -and, al last, inflamed 
atmosphere in Baku.[89-90] 
  Going back to the sources it is noteworthy that above 250 thousand of Azerbaijanians wouldn't have 
been killed if Stepan Shaumyan had relied on the Red Guard, on worker's detachments formed by Dzhaparidze 
but not the detachment of L.Bicherakhov and his assistant in the person of Gaik Nadzharov, socialist -
revolutionary, minister of justice of the Caucasus-Caspian government, Alexander Araxyan, dashnak, vice-
chairman of Baku Soviet, Artashes Melik-Kolchyan, dashnak, a member of government of dictatorships of 
Centrocaspy, Nerscs Dzhikityan, dashnak, chief of counter-espionage Bicherakhov, R. Bagaturov, one of the 
leaders of Baku Mensheviks, Grant Avetesyan gnchakist, A.Mikoyan's relative, as well as on dashnak's army. 
   As it is known, trial of 41 persons accused of shooting 26 Baku commissars was divided into 3 stages 
(?!). The first-in Krasnovodsk in 1921 (April, 19-26), the second-in Baku in 1926 (April, 17-27), the third - also 
in Baku in 1927 (March, 1-6). 
  I.Stalin was not interested in disclosing of Mikoyan's role (his classmate at theological seminary) in this 
case. So the main part of trial was 5-6 years delayed. You need not be a prophet to guess - why? 
  First, knowing Lenin's merciless unbiased attitude towards everything .that concerned revolutionary 
truth (let's remember "the Georgian matter" when V.l. Lenin gave a sharp appraisal to the actions of Stalin, 
Ordzhonikidze and Dzerzhinsky (A. M.), he did not want to loose a close friend as he hoped that his physical 
deficiency of which his friend had suffered since his school years in future will grow into a moral one and will 
serve him, I.Stalin, a good guarantee of his loyally and it was so up to 1953, when Stalin died. 
    Second, I.V.Stalin better that others knew of A.Mikoyan's true role in Baku events and in fate of 
commissars. 
    By the way, let's go back to the trial. Here B. Sheboldaev's evidence deserves attention: 
"BAKU SOVIET OF PEOPLE'S COMMISSARS HEADED BY COMRADE SHAUMYAN 
UNDERSTOOD WELL THAT BICHERAKHOV WITH HIS DETACHMENT IS ONLY AN ADVANCED 
DETACHMENT OF THE ENGLISH BUT UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF FAILURES ON THE FRONT 
(WHEN DASHNAK AMAZASP AND MAUZERIST MIKOYAN WERE BUSY IN ROBBERIES AND 
MURDERS OF CIVILIAN [90-91] 
POPULATION IN SHEMAKHA - A.M.) AND NECESSARY CONCESSION TO PUBLIC OPINION 
(MAJORITY COULD NOT UNDERSTAND WHY NOT TO USE SUCH A GOOD DETACHMENT, 
WHICH HAD RECOGNIZED THE SOVIET POWER IN WORDS) HAD TO DO IT".  
    To understand the puzzled public let's then listen to I. Agamirov: "We (!? - A.M.) had at our disposal 
20 battalions of soldiers, brought together into 3 brigades composed mainly of Armenians (it means deserters 
from thug Andranik's detachment - A.M.) and some part of Baku workers-Armenians, joining their squads 
according to their party sign(gnchakists, dashnaks) who later joined regular Military units. 
   The first brigade was under command of Amazasp, the second-of Aru-lyunov and third, if I am not 
mistaken, (probably, flows of Azerbaijan people's blood put S. Agamirov out of memory - A.M. ) under 
command of ex-officer Bcknazarov". 
    Thus S.Shaumyan and A.Mikoyan in the struggle for the establishing of the Soviet power in Azerbaijan 
were in close collaboration with deserters and dregs from Andranik's detachment, a desperate enemy of Soviet 
Russia Bicherakhov, relied on inveterate gnchakists and dashnaks Amazasp, Dro and Nzhde. It is noteworthy 
that such true revolutionaries, Bolsheviks-Leninists as Aljosha Dzhaparidzc, Ivan Fioletov, Meshadi Azizbekov, 
et al. who had been deceived and led into error by S.Shaumyan and Anastas Mi-koyan became involuntary 
accomplices of their evil deeds. 
   It is very sad to draw some conclusions which should be made, by all means, by historians. 
    How nice the Bolsheviks of Russia were if they would be supported by Denikin, Kaledin, Semenov and 
Kolchak and other anti-soviet elements in their struggle for establishment of Soviel power. But what were 
Amazasp and fighting "commissar" A. Mikoyan doing? 
  "When the troops were approaching village Akhsu near Shemakha I was called up on the phone by the 
officials of the 2nd brigade who tried to find commander Amazasp and his commissar. We sent a courier but in 
vain, they  could find commander Amazasp nowhere. Only by 5 o'clock p.m. he was found (together with A. 
Mikoyan - A.M.) in company of 3 nurses in a back carriage of the train". 
(Newspaper "Azerbaijan", March, 1918).[91-92] 
 
   "THE FACT THAT S.SHAUMYAN, AMAZASP, AVETISOV, MIKOYAN, TATEVOS AMIROV, 
ET. ALL WERE OPENLY CALLED AT THE MEETINGS' AS GERMAN SPIES' WAS THE RESULT OF 
SOCIALIST-REVOLUTIONARY'S INTRIGUES." (!? - A.M.). 
(From the evidences of Pleshakov). 
   On the other hand, being afraid of requital for the blood of innocent Azerbaijan population shed without 
any motive, Amazasp, Mikoyan, Avetisov, general Bagratuni, Arutyunov and Beknazarov implored soldiers - 
 43
Armenians to fight to the last man against Turks hurrying to help defenseless people, other wise, they said, 
everybody of you would be hung in the nearest tree. S.Shaumyan also understood that well. 
   It would not be extra to cite evidences of other witnesses at the trial to have some ideas of double or 
triple politics of gnchakists. 
  Thus, Ter-Gabrielyan said: "On July 30, 1918 general Bagratuni gathered us at the meeting to discuss the 
question on defence of Baku. At this meeting there were dashnaks Gyulkhandanyan and Rostom (Zoryan -
A.M.) who promised to send immediately 1000 of Armenian soldiers to the positions. 
   Then I went to the Soviet of people's commissars, according to S. Shaumyan's suggestion. By 4 o'clock 
in the morning.colonel Avetisov rang me up from Baladzhary position and informed me that dashnaks had sent 
21 soldiers instead of 1000 and even they went back to the city with the first shots (to continue robbing 
population - A.M.). 
    After that I rang comrade Shaumyan up, he answered that he would come at once and also asked 
Gyulkhandanyan and Rostom to come. When the latters arrived I began to reproach them for betrayal. Comrade 
Stepan interrupted me and offered to arrange matters (?!) quietly (with dashnaks! -A.M.) but Gyulkhandanyan 
declared: "Why don't you yield the power, well we'll manage without you". 
   HERE WE SAW THAT THERE WAS NOTHING TO SPEAK TO THEM ABOUT ANY MORE AND 
BY 11 O'CLOCK A.M. WE CALLED URGENTLY A SPECIAL COUNCIL, WHERE WE LAID DOWN 
OUR AUTHORITIES' AND INFORMED OF OUR LEAVING FOR ASTRAKHAN.[92-93] 
   Then we organized some separate meeting at Baku party committee, where we decided to evacuate all 
the valuables out of Baku (including 20 million of public money in gold, from which 10 million S.Shaumyan 
with the help of dashnak officer Vardanyan could convey out of Baku but traces of the rest 10 million were lost 
- A.M.) 
    Witness Artak said: "After overthrow of the Soviet power in Baku where there were the English and the 
so-called dictatorship of "Centrocaspy" the information was published in the socialist-revolutionary newspaper 
"Znamya truda" and in Menshcvik newspaper "Iskra" that the German spies had been arrested who arrived in 
Baku with a letter to Shaumyan (in fact, German emissaries came to Baku, who according to their words, were 
members of German mission concerning prisoners of war - A.M.) 
   Suren Shaumyan said: "In July I was sent to Moscow on business and returned on July 254, not earlier". 
(A.Rukshan "The last days of the Commissars of Baku Commune", Baku, 192S, page 68) 
   There should be given some explanation here when V. I. Lenin learned through N.Narimanov about real 
aims of S.Shaumyan and his evil deeds against the Azerbaijan people, when under pretence of struggle for the 
Soviet power he had for an object to make "Great Armenia", Lenin demanded strictly through Suren Shaumyan 
to stop immediately beating people and to tell Stepan Shaumyan that he would be brought to trial of the 
revolutionary-military tribunal. The whole hope of the latter was connected with the English and dashnaks who 
had hidden themselves in Krasnovodsk and he launched out on his last venture, into which he drew real. 
Bolsheviks, favorites of people - true Baku Commissars and when Suren on his arrival on July, 25 told the 
Chairman of Sovnarkom about that terrible demand S.Shaumyan had nothing to do but to seek the ways for 
flight and to get ready to leave Baku which was gushing blood. 
   However, at first he failed. Under pressure of people's fury he and his accomplices deceived by him 
were arrested to be put to trial. But S.Shaumyan was lucky to escape from Bailov prison. Knowing well what 
expected him, in fact he kept his partners surrounding him as hostages, who up to the last moments did not 
understand whom they were following! But V.I.Lenin knew that very well. [93-94] 
    And when the Soviet-German relations became better after humiliating but saving for Soviet Russia 
Brest-Lithuanian treaty (March, 1918) and Stepan Shaumyan could be ransomed, that had not been done. Now it 
becomes clear why!!! But Stalin all the same through his agents got A.Mikoyan out and later saving their face 
before the party, they skilfully concealed the whole truth about Stepan Shaumyan? 
    Zhukov, inspector of the Extraordinary commission of the dictatorship "Centrocaspy" said: "In some 
days after arrests I was called to the Extraordinary Commission and there vice-chairman Dalin showed me three 
or four brief-cases, THE PROCEEDING OF OPENING THE BRIEF-CASES AND THE CONFISCATION 
ACT OF 20,000 ROUBLES IN GOLD FROM S.SHAUMYAN... 
   I REMEMBER THAT IN SHAUMYAN'S BRIEF-CASE THERE WAS HIS CORRESPONDENCE 
WITH BICHERAKOV AND BARATOV (LAZAR BICHERACKHOV IS A COLONEL, COMMANDER-IN-
CHIEF TROOPS OF DICTATORSHIP GOVERNMENT, LATER THE CHAIRMAN OF THE CAUCASIAN-
CASPIAN GOVERNMENT, ENGLISH GOVERNMENT HENCHMAN, ASHOT BARATOV IS A 
MEMBER OF "THE ARMENIAN NATIONAL BUREAU"). 
   Then Dalin pointing to two men said that they had been sent by "Centrocaspy" for inquiry into the 
matter. One of them was Atabekov - a bank employee (I think - dashnak) the second - a naval pilot Bryzgalov. 
(Atabekov Arshavir - dashnak, attached to the Committee of inquiry on the case of arrested commissars, 
Bryzgalov - a representative of dictatorship "Centrocaspy" in the Committee of inquiry on the case of arrested 
 44
commissars - A.M.). I gave them the files and they began to look through all the papers taken away from 
commissars. What they have found there. I don't remember, to my mind, nothing. THIS FOLLOWED FROM 
THE FACT THAT ATABEKOV  WHEN   MEETING   ME  SAID:   "COMMISSARS   HAVE   EATEN 
WELL". 
   Isai Dovlatov (cooperative worker, keeper of entertainment house) said: 
    "As soon as I was summoned, Zhukov, investigator on the case of 26 (A.Mikoyan together with 
Amazasp escaped from the trial again) put such kind of question: "We have information that you often visited 
Shaumyan and others, what is their way of living? What kind of persons are they? Are they [94-95] 
connected with the Turks? What is the family status of Shaumyan, Amiryan and others? Is it true that they 
go on the sprees?" 
    In dashnak newspaper the article was published entitled "By the Soviet power" where it was written 
that Shaumyan had appropriated public money, that Tatevos Amirov wilfully took 175,000 roubles (gold) from 
food commissariat, Sumbat Markarov, the chief of water transport, also took public money..." 
From the evidences of Suren Shaumyan: "Before leaving the prison I had a talk with comrade Stepan, he 
was very thoughtful and said: "I'D LIKE TO MAKE THE LAST EFFORT, I DON'T KNOW WHAT WILL BE 
OUT OF THIS. AFTER DASHNAKS MADE SURE THAT THE ENGLISH HAD DECEIVED THEM I 
WANT AGAIN TO RAISE A QUESTION ON COLLABORATION WITH THEM. I HAVE LITTLE HOPE 
BUT MAY BE IN SUCH A WAY WE'LL SAVE BAKU" (from whom and for whom? - A.M.). 
   He wrote a letter and asked to give it to Rostom Zaryan, one of the founders of "the Dashnaktsutyun" 
party, who was in Baku at that time and who though was not practically at the head of the Armenian National 
Council, in fact, directed its policy. 
   Comrade Stepan explained dashnaks that they went wrong with the English, they were deceived and 
offered to collaborate. On that very day I gave the letter to Rostom Zoryan and Gyulkhandanyan - another 
dashnak swindler. The latter said that he would be able to give an answer after discussion of that question at the 
Armenian National Council and asked me to come the next day. 
    The next day he said that the question had not been considered yet but by his manner of speaking I felt 
that he would be glad if I did not come again. When I told Shaumyan about that he said: "DON'T GO ANY 
MORE, DON'T SPEAK TO THEM. IT IS CLEAR THAT THEY WANT TO DO NOTHING FOR US AND 
OUR COMMON PURPOSE." (It means, dashnaks and S.Shaumyan have a common purpose - A.M.). 
   Well, now everything is clear. Between two groupings of gnchakisls and dashnaks the frank struggle 
was taking place for Baku and so for Azerbaijan! You know, they have common purpose - TO MAKE GREAT 
ARMENIA AT THE EXPENSE OF AZERBAIJAN! The question was what grouping will realize it! [95-96] 
    Seeing that he did not succeed in concluding an alliance with dashnaks, the English and Turks, 
Mikoyan launched out on the last adventure, which could make it possible to realize plans for making "Great 
Armenia". There have been know close contacts of S.Shaumyan and A.Mikoyan with cutthroat Andranik, who 
in 1918 declared himself to be "a national hero" and supporter of the Soviet power. And what is more, the 
history has kept S.Shaumyan's telegram to Andranik, in which he greeted him as a national hero. And when 
"Ccntrocaspy" government has been presented the proposal signed by S.Shaumyan in the prison, where among 
other items there were such as invitation of Andranik's detachment to Baku, liberation of commissars and 
handing over the power to them, then the government discovered easily Trojan motion of compilers of those 
proposals. 
   That is how it was told about by Georgy Sturua, Bolshevik, one of the eldest members of Baku Council 
of the II-nd and III-rd convocations: 
  "I informed the government : Centrocaspy" on these requirements. They discussed them at the special 
meeting and declined them. On the ground that first, WE WANT TO INVITE OUR UNITS TO ORGANIZE 
AGAIN CIVIL WAR HERE LIKE MARCH EVENTS (1918)" (i.e. in fact, to continue annihilation of the 
Azerbaijan people - A.M.). 
   SECOND, FOR SAVING OF OUR ARRESTED COMRADES WHO WILL BE AT THE HEAD OF 
THIS GENOCIDE OF THE DEFENSELESS AZERBAIJAN PEOPLE. 
   At the same time they declared that our proposals will be probably accepted by them, i.e. BY 
"CENTROCASPY" GOVERNMENT ONLY IN THAT CASE, IF WE AGREE TO PASS FROM THE 
SOVIET RUSSIA THROUGH ASTRAKHAN THE RED ARMY UNITS TO DEFEND BAKU". 
   Here, a conclusion can be drawn that dictatorship of "Centrocaspy" wanted to see in Baku only 
Bolsheviks and the Red Army. But as far as the murderous actions of S.Shaumyan's support, on the one hand, 
and of Gyulkhandadyan, on the other hand, made it necessary to defend the Azerbaijan people and as a 
consequence of interference of the English and Turks, the government of "Centrocaspy" dictatorship had to 
leave Baku. Soviet Russia itself at that lime was having severe fighting for its existence and could not lend a 
helping hand to the Azerbaijan people. [96-98] 
   From the affidavit of witness Anastas Mikoyan to the interrogator:  
 45
   On the last day, on September 14, when "Centrocaspy" government were  already on the board of the 
ship and I was alone in their office waiting for Velunts, who had to come back from the front (front line in 
Baladzhary, where the Turkish troops were hurrying to help the bleeding Azerbaijan population) and who had 
been commander of the company (Velunts, Abram - gnchakist, organizer of massacre beating and murdering of 
Azerbaijanians, later on the government member of "Centrocaspy" dictatorship who joined socialist-
revolutionaries - A.M.). I began to scold him and told him either he would go with me or I would leave the 
evidences of his brutality to Turks. 
   Under the influence of my words Valunts went with me to the Committee of inquiry, where there was 
only Dalin with soldiers. 
   As a result they allowed me to evacuate the arrested under escort from Baku". 
   To my mind I need not comment these words of Anastas Mikoyan, this Bolshevist Gapon enjoying 
complete confidence of dashnaks, gnchakists, socialist-revolutionaries, the English and tsarist Okhranka. 
    The evidences of Dolgov, a member of Krasnovodsk revolt committee are very interesting: 
    "When all the Commissars were detained they were placed separately and brought to Krasnovodsk and 
before that they were searched... 
    During arrest they were pointed to by some short Armenian of plain appearance with broken nose." 
Here the following fact will be emphasized: within 50 years after the trial A.Mikoyan with the help of 
Suren Shaumyan and G. and B.Garibzhanyans in every possible way belittled his role in the tragic fate of Baku 
commissars. In this case some versions were composed first, he stayed in Baku; second he could be lost in the 
crowd of refugees: third, just on this version Mikoyan pressed himself being a headman of the ward was away 
to get food for the arrested so he said for that reason he was not among 26 , though he was very popular as an 
active organizer of murderous events in Baku and not less popular as a member of Menshevik socialist-
revolutionary Baku Soviet. [97-98] 
    In any case, later on Anastas Mikoyan and Suren Shaumyan systematically took out and destroyed 
Baku archives concerning the events of those times. 
    On the role of A.Mikoyan, having saved his life by means of betrayal, Suren Shaumyan testified, 
without understanding it himself. Later when the book by well-known Soviet historian A.S.Bukshan had been 
published, Mikoyan implored I.Stalin to with draw this book of 500 copies. In some years when A.Mikoyan 
with the help of L.Beriya has removed all the documents out of the Azerbaijan archives which compromised 
him and Lavrenty, that book was not included in the list of materials liable to destruction, as Anastas 
Ovanesovich Mikoyan was firmly convinced thai it was destroyed in 1928 together with its author. 
    But, thank God, one copy has been left whole by some miracle. 
    Thus, from the evidences of Suren Shaumyan on the trial: "Then comrade Tatevos Amirov tried to save 
the situation. He landed and told Kondakov (A.M.Kondakov is a vice-chairman of Krasnovodsk revolt 
committee -A.M.) and Alaniya (F.Alaniya - the chief of Krasnovodsk militia), who were standing nearby, that 
he had important secret information. Amirov took them aside and spoke to them for a short time. It was found 
out later that he wanted to prove that he was not a Bolshevik and he took part in the defence of Baku to the last 
moment in the ranks of dashnak army" (i.e. differently speaking, he admitted his criminal role against the 
Azerbaijan population -A.M.). 
   His objective was to convince them that as a military leader of Baku socialist-revolutionary army, as 
one of the subordinates of "Centrocaspy" he took into custody Bolshevik commissars and he must bring them to 
Petrovsk to pass them to Bicherackhov. But that trick did at work here. Kondakov and his company apparently 
had a very good information. (I should think so, they have shed so, they have shed so much blood - A.M.) 
   Amirov seeing that his trick did not work had to give an order to the rest of detachment to disarm. 
   When all the weapon was taken away they began to arrest my comrades one by one and search them. 
Nobody had any weapon but Mikoyan, he had "Kolt" revolver. The rest had no weapon because THEY HAD 
LEFT BAKU [98-99] 
PRISON (MIKOYAN HAD NOT BEEN ARRESTED, SO HE HAD WEAPON). 
    Well, Suren has not taken into consideration that such clumsy and hasty explanation will frighten 
A.Mikoyan so much later on. Something strange and mysterious is taking place. A.Mikoyan dismisses the 
arrested and leads them disarmed about the city!Tatevos Amiryan, whose detachment was armed to the teeth did 
not give arms to the discharged even if to resist hostile crew and above 400 refugees on board of the ship 
"Turkmen?!". 
    Being afraid of getting himself into trouble and deserved punishment for murdering hundreds of 
thousands of innocent people some "valiant defenders" of Baku showed their true face. 
    But, let us go back to Surcn Shaumyan:  
     "THIS CATCHING TOOK PLACE DURING APPROXIMATELY 3 HOURS, IF NOT LONGER, IN 
THIS CASE EVIDENT TREACHEROUS PROVOCATING PART WAS PLAYED BY AMIROV'S AIDE-
 46
DE-CAMP KEGAMYAN RUBEN, OUR BAKU CITIZEN" (since what time has great grandson of Tiflis shop-
keeper Lazar Shaulov become Baku citizen? - A.M.). 
   The Armenian part of population remembers this surname well, because his father was one of the most 
popular priests (Suren was telling the truth, yes, the Armenian residents of Baku remembered well evil deals of 
Ruben and violent instigation of his father, close friend of Mesrop - A.M.). So this Amirov's aide-de-camp to 
save his own skin, began to betray all our comrades pointing them to Alaniya and his fellows". 
("Last  Days of the Commissars of Baku Commune' ,Baku, 1928, p. 68-69.) 
   Thus "ALL OUR COMRADES!". By what price has Anastas Mikoyan survived? Since 1921 to their 
last days of life under Stalinist lock there kept silence Olga Shatunovskaya (S.Shaumyan's secretary), Varvara 
Dzhaparidze (Alyosha's wife). Olga Fioletova (Vanya's wife), Suren, Artak, Markaryan (a commissar of water 
transport), Karinyan (commissar of justice of Baku Commune), people's commissars Ter-Saakyan and 
Nuridzhanyan. But Anaslas Mikoyan was terribly afraid and perhaps, not without reason dashnak in the past, 
who in 20-s had become leader of Baku Communists. 
   In 1928 Mikoyan with the help of Artak, Suren Shaumyan and Olga Shatunovskaya made an effort to 
discredit L.Mirzoyan at the XVIII Baku Party [99-100] 
conference, but failed (read the short-hand account of the XVIII Baku conference , Baku 1928- A.M.) 
   In Moscow, Mirzoyan had a serious talk with Anastas, after which Levon was sent to party work in 
Central Asia. Well, living witnesses of his mean past did not suit Mikoyan, at any rate such as Levon Mirzoyan. 
After a set of fabricated forgeries Levon was isolated and murdered in 1937 in Lubjanka prison. It is noteworthy 
that A.Mikoyan shot him with his own hands (he had begged Stalin for this chance ravishing for him) as well as 
he shot the leader of Armenian Communists Khandzhyan in his study in the Central Committee of Armenia 
party, who being a member of "Dashnaktsutyun" knew much about Anastas Mikoyan's real past. Physical 
closeness of Stalin with Anastas transmitted to the latter the worst features of the first his pathological fear to be 
unmasked. Thus future enemies Stalin first praised. He said: "What do they want? Bukharin's blood? No, we 
won't give it!". It was in the 20-s. But in the 30-s Bukharin was trampled in a sadistic manner first morally, then 
physically. In this case Stalin never destroyed his future victim frankly, he did that with the help of others. 
Stalin's talented assistant adopted well his patron's habits. 
   From the evidence of witness Levan Gogoberidze, Bolshevik, worker of Baku Commune: 
   "When our party member, young Levon Mirzoyan, addressed the participants of working conference 
with declaration on behalf of Bolshevik party, his words were met with a storm of applause. LET COMRADE 
MIRZOYAN NOT BE OFFENDED BUT WHEN HE AND I WERE DRAWING UP THIS DECLARATION 
WE COULD HARDLY WRITE POLITICAL THINGS AND THIS DECLARATION WAS THE MOST 
LAME, THE MOST LITERATE AND UNIMPORTANT AS REGARDS TO STYLISTICS." 
  So Levon appeared to be an illiterate and worthless politician. Just these accusations were later the 
reason of Mirzoyan's reprisal by Stalin and Mikoyan. 
  A.Mikoyan could outlive 3 General Secretaries skilfully taking advantage of his natural ability to find 
his "place under the sun". And when the question of his burial at the Kremlin wall had been settled, the leaders 
of competent organs presented the appropriate documents and L.Brezhnev with a [100-101] 
heavy heart was obliged to order to bury one of the "evil revolution geniuses" in Novodevich'e graveyard. 
Thanks to the efforts of the Moscow "lobby" these unmasking documents have not been published yet. But time 
will come! 
   Openness and democratization of our Socialist society will be realized may be not very soon, but it will 
result in clarifying one blank space more (black or while? - A.M.) in the tragic history of our people and our 
revolution. 
    Separate examples from the history of the Azerbaijan people struggle for their free self-determination 
have been cited only to show how dark reaction forces wanted to suppress historically urgent problem and how 
life itself have thrown them away. 
   Let us hope that the dynamic development of our society, the objective prerequisites of its renewal will 
never make it possible to appear in the political scene of such sinister persons as Anastas Mikoyan, Lavrenty 
Beriya, Georgy Abakumov and others whom it had been implanted the virus of social- nationalism and 
chauvinism. 
   The present day leaders of "the Armenian problem" manipulating, figures rather free and easy call for 
public's sympathy. In fact, Ihe fate of the Armenian people is long-suffering and miserable like that of Gypsy 
and Jewish nation. They were scattered about the world and only by the IX-X-th centuries B.C. they found 
shelter on the lands of Turkey and Persia and assimilated among local population but keeping their customs and 
national traditions. 
    As N.Sokolsky informs in "the Essays on Modern Turkey" in 1923 in Tiflis the number of Armenians 
living in Turkey was 1 MILLION 285 THOUSAND in 1915. After the Armenian - Turkish, Armenian - 
Georgian and Armenian - Azerbaijanian wars unleashed by leaders of "the Gnchak" and "Dashnaktsutyun" on 
 47
the Turkey territory only about 380 THOUSAND, survived 600 THOUSAND have emigrated to Egypt and 
Syria, India and Pakistan, England and France, Australia and Indonesia, the USA and Canada, Ethiopia and 
Mexico, Cyprus, Italy, Rumania and many other countries. The deported part of Armenians to the inland of 
Mesopotamia numbered 100 thousand of persons. The rest part was killed during the above-mentioned wars. 
Nothing else is left but to guess how the so-called [101-102] 
"genocide" annihilated 2 million of Armenians. Genrikh Borovik, Galina Starovoytova, Andrei Sakharov 
and some others have to think over it. But we shall go back to history. 
   Armenian disorders in Turkey since 1906 to 1918 and in Azerbaijan (Karabakh) since 1965 to 1989 is a 
convincing illustration of one thing -TERRITORIAL CLAIM there and only there where they have been given 
shelter. And though I did not want to refer to origins in this part of the book, it would not be extra to refer to 
well-known Soviet historian, great specialist in Renaissance history and culture, a corresponding member of the 
Armenian Academy of sciences, author of many books on history of the so-called "West Armenia" Alexei 
Karpovich Dzhivelegov who wrote: 'Since 1982 to 1912 the Armenian population of Great Armenia left for the 
neighbouring countries, 612 thousand in number." 
    From 1893 the Armenian armed uprisals took place in Turkey as a chain reaction. 
    March 1893          - powerful uprisal in Ankara and environs 
     September 1984 - organized uprisal and massacre of peaceable 
                                   population in Ak Khisar (September-October), in Trab- 
                                  zon (October), Bitlis (October), Erzerum (October),  
                                 Arabkir (November), Diyarbekir (November), Malat’e  
                                  (November), Marash (November), Kaiseri (November) and in other regions. 
    Gnchakists and Armenian nationalists like Andranik were at the head of these actions. A typical feature 
was the fact that Armenian fighting men were armed with fire-arms, artillery and grenades but the population 
defended them selves with pitchforks, spades and cudgels (and nothing has been changed in the present-day 
events when Karabakh peasants and workers with the same pitchforks and spades defend themselves against 
well-armed emissaries - A.M.) 
    It should be mentioned that the European countries having violent desire to destroy Turkey still 
disapproved the policy of gnchakisls who had set themselves as an objects to murder the peaceable population 
and to slab the country in the back which had shctlcrcd them.[102-103] 
    That is what newspaper "Gnchak" wrote about in 1896: "The European diplomats starting with 
Solsbery and finishing with Lobanov Rosmovsky (minister of foreign affairs. - A.M.) are angry with us and 
reprimand us our small nation of which all Europe is neither hot, not cold... They scold us, why we are indignant 
at the internal policy of Turkey and expose to danger its existence". 
    Meanwhile, the extremist bosses of the "Armenian problem (like today's-A.M.) were looking for any 
ways and were not ashamed of any means for attracting on their side of the heads of any country. 
    So Constantinople patriarch, Armenian Movses Khrimyan just after Nickolas's II coronation in 1894 
arrived in Peterstburg and had a meeting with him. He hypocritically told the tsar that the Armenians in Russia 
were happy as they enjoyed Russian protection but the West Armenians go on suffering under the Turkey yoke. 
He expressed his hope that the time had come to put an end to "troubles" of the West Armenians and with the 
help of Russian tsar's blessing and weapon to do away with the long-standing Armenian problem i.e. in fact, he 
invited Russia to war with Turkey. In spite of his stupidity the tsar understood that the most ordinary 
provocateur was sitting in front of him and sent him away as he remembered well of Armenian's actions against 
Russians. Besides, he remembered well the report of ;   Russia Minister of Foreign affairs Sazonov: 
    "THE AIM OF DEPORTATION OF CERTAIN NATION (i.e. The Armenians. - A.M.) CONSISTS IN 
SECURITY OF PROSPERITY FOR OWN  STATE IN FUTURE, AS WHERE EVER THEY LIVE. THEY 
WOULD NEVER DECLINE THEIR REBELLIOUS PURPOSES, SO THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT TENDS 
TO DEPORT AS MANY OF THEM AS POSSIBLE AND TO LEAVE A RELIABLE PART". 
   Sazonov asked tsar about actions of Russian diplomacy. Nickolas II wrote on the report: "Do in Rome 
as the Romans do". 
    In January 1895 Nicholas II approved his ambassador's actions in Istambul and at the same time he 
considered it necessary a Russian delegate in the commission for investigation of mass-scale murders of Turks 
by Armenians to keep nearer to his French colleague but not English who "could pursue another aim". [103-
104] 
    However strange it is for some present day, "activists of Armenian problem" but V.I.Lenin, as well as 
the Bolsheviks of the Caucasus thought that "that Armenian problem had been created'AND SWOLLEN 
EXCLUSIVELY BY POLITICAL AGENTS OF ENGLAND" WHO UNDER COVER OF PROTECTION OF 
MISERABLE ARMENIANS SUFFERING FOR THE CHRIST "PURSUE ONLY ONE OBJECT-DISTRACT 
EUROPE AWAY FROM THE TRUTH OF LARGE VIOLENCE COMMITTED BY HERSELF IN 
IRELAND, INDIA, EGYPT AND OTHER COLONIES". 
 48
    It is known V.I.Lenin's position on this question cited in another part of the book. However, just as 
today, in Russia there were many literary and public men who having got some bribe passionately took the part 
of Armenians and published groundless theses, there were such people among foreigners especially the English. 
We shall give only some names Y.Veselovsky, L.Komarovskv, A.Mandelshtam (don't confuse with poet Osip 
M. - A.M.), K.Balmont, Gladston, Rollen-zhekmen, McCaul, Grin and Dillon. These marionettes served for 
long-term plans of the English policy to carry out the division of Osman empire to strengthen dominion of 
Albion over this region, legitimate the capture of Egypt and to become firmly established in the region of 
Persian Gulf and Mesopotamia. Russian diplomacy has guessed long ago a "sly" plan of England and adhered to 
a position of status quo. 
   On the whole the English policy in the "Armenian problem" was a masterpiece of political cheating into 
which the English tried to draw Germany, Russia and the USA. 
   To disavow their protectors-the English, on August 15, 1898, correspondent of newspaper "Armenia" 
wrote from Istambul about English consul in Van: "We aren't sure that THIS CONSUL WILL GIVE HIS 
GOVERNMENT FAVOURABLE FOR ARMENIANS INFORMATION AS, TO SPEAK THE TRUTH, HE 
IS RATHER A TURKISH TOADY THAN AN HONEST OFFICIAL". Just the same has been also written 
about consuls in Tigranakert, Erzerum and other cities as if the English depended on the Turks. All these 
stratagems and demagogic fabrications were directed by London in order to distract the Turkish powers. Let us 
cite a typical example of such games.[104-105] 
    English ambassador Filipp Karri, a close friend of patriarch Mkrtych, asked an audience with the 
TURKISH sultan where he declared that the Armenian movement was caused by the outrages and persecution 
in the Turkish Armenia. The sultan rejected this otherwise, he would be, according to his words, informed by 
patriarch Mkrtych. The sultan asked the ambassadors to put an end to Armenians' instigations, to give an advice 
and to convince their ringleaders that their future unlawful and inhuman actions would not bring any good. 
Filipp Karri being embarrassed by the sultan's frank "march"left the residence but promised to "think". Thus, 
with the best will in the world the English diplomacy failed to annihilate the artificially made up "Armenian 
problem". At the same time, to give more truthfulness to the Turks, "evil deeds", gnchakists and dashnaks 
organized letters-petitions to the embassies and consulates of European countries from almost illiterate peasants 
of such villages as Bakhsha Kniat, Khusseinan, Abo, Cherek, Gureshan, Keza-Khassar, Salekan and many 
others. However, the fact was striking that manner of writing was the same, the requirements were the similar 
and "brutality" of the Turks was described as if using copying paper (Let us remember the address of the 
Armenians of NKAR and Armenia. -A.M.). 
    A Russian ambassador in Constantinople wrote to Petersburg concerning this "THAT WITH ALL THE 
MOST EFFICIENT ORGANIZATION OF THE ARMENIAN COMMITTEE MEMBERS THEY WERE 
SHORT OF RICHER IMAGINATION". (Haven't the acts of those committees much in common with the 
present-day "Karabakh" and "Krunk"?! - A.M.). 
    It is interesting the changeable position of some European statesmen towards the Armenian hysteria 
swollen artificially. So minister of Germany Foreign affairs baron fon Byulov said: "AS I BELIEVE MY EYES 
MORE I PREFER NOT TO BE ENGAGED IN THE ARMENIA PROBLEM". 
Well-known German journalist Vilhelm Libknekht in the newspaper "Forverts" in 1895 characterized the 
Armenian committees and first off all "Gnchak". 
   Jean Zhores published his sharp article on the pages of newspaper "La petit Republique" where he 
expressed his opinion that "the Armenian nationalistic movement was the fruit of instigation on the part of 
tsarism". Later on under the influence of the Armenian millionaires he changed his [105-106] 
point of view. But the cases took places when in Germany the clergymen Ioganes Lepsius and Lohman 
collected donations for the Armenians. They collected only in 1896 about 565 thousand of marks, bought and 
sent arms to the Armenian committee members to Turkey and the Transcaucasus (the latter is very important, 
we shall be convinced in it when we diccuss the events in Baku and Stepanakert) 
    In 1800-s large groups of Armenians left for the USA. They settled down in New-York, Ustra, Boston 
and some cities of New England. The American Armenians discussed actively the problems of international 
politics, loading everybody around with presents. It came to wives of heads of the Governments, especially 
European. It is interesting when in 1902 a group of Armenian millionaires sent a tiara studded with large 
diamonds to the Russian tsarina then Nickolas II by consent of his indignant wife called Baku millionaire 
Lalaev to his place (do not confuse him with bandit S.Lalaev -A.M.), held out the Armenian present to him and 
said: "Mister Lalaev, are you really oppressed?!". Lalaev was confused and left the place in a hurry. Meanwhile, 
with the help of the Armenian lobby having set up in the USA, the public opinion of the senate leading top was 
tilting in the Armenians' favour. 
   A special activity showed well-known Armenian public man in the USA Musheg Gabrielyan and some 
public figures grouped around newspaper "Aik" edited by him. On December 3, 1894 the USA senate adopted 
the resolution concerning the Armenians' oppression (let us remember the USA senate decision in 1989. - 
 49
A.M.). In this document it was condemned the policy of the Turkish authorities and it was suggested to the 
powers to send a joint address to the Sultan government. However, the president did not support the senate for 
reason that he had no information except publications in newspapers and two telegrams from the ambassador in 
Constantinople. At that lime in revenge it has been organized the arson and robbery of the Armenian college in 
Marzvan. President Klivlend required explanation, especially as, newspaper "Aik" described the Turkish 
brutality in the most refined lone! AND WHEN THE TURKISH GOVERNMENT ORGANIZED THE 
PUBLIC TRIAL AGAINST INSTIGATORS NERSES ARTSRUNI AND GEVORG KHURSHUDYAN 
HAVING BEGIN CAUGHT (but third could escape) AND INVITED CORRESPONDENTS [106-107] 
OF EUROPEAN NEWSPAPERS THEN THE SOURCES OF THIS MALICIOUS PROVOCATION 
BECAME EVIDENT. Even newspaper "Aik" could not comment what had happened. Knowing very well the 
habits of committee members the Sultan government invited the USA consulate representative for watching in 
the commission where there were England and France representatives. It would be advisable for some statesmen 
dealing with problems of present-day international relations begun since 1985 to adopt the historical experience, 
to establish closer links with people but not to give incompetent and not clear recommendations silting in their 
armchairs and showing in this case one-sided sympathies. 
    In December, 1985 the USA senate under the influence of misinformed public demanded explanations 
regarding encroachment of the Turkish authorities on properly of Armenians and already Armenians living in 
Turkey. 
    THIS TIME KLIVLEND MADE UP HIS MIND TO SEND A GROUP OF SENATORS TO TURKEY 
WHO AFTER A MONTH'S STAYING IN TURKEY HAVE MADE A STATEMENT THAT 
"INFORMATION IN PRESS ON MASSACRE AND ROBBERIES OF ARMENIANS TO A GREAT 
DEGREE ARE EXAGGERATED, IF NOT FALSE". Having failed once more, the Armenian committee 
members organized an unexampled slaughtcrof Moslems in Sasun in 1895-1896. 
   "Boston Gerald" newspaper wrote in February 1894: "AN OVERWHELMING MAJORITY OF 
ARMENIANS CANNOT READ OR WRITE AND ARE HARDLY READY FOR SELF-GOVERNMENT, 
EVEN IF ARMENIA WERE AN INDEPENDENT COUNTRY INHABITED ONLY BY ARMENIANS. IT IS 
FELT THAT THEY ARE RULED BY WELL-DISGUISED AND COMPETENT LEADERS". 
   Such turn aroused sincere indignation of Armenians in the USA. The same M.Gabrielyan wrote: "It is 
difficult to read such articles without anger." 
   In June, 1895 in New-York "The Armenian Patriotic Union" organization was set up, it had the aim of 
making "Great Armenia". Refined actions of the Armenian parties, committees had no desirable effect. But in 
August, 1895 dashnak Salakh Gulyan reported from Paris that "at present from the point of view of diplomatic 
interests the Armenian problem, perhaps, can be considered completely settled".  The time of self-delusion and 
complacency [107-108] 
has come. In fact, the leaders understood well that they should not stop half-way. To make the Armenian 
"liberation movement" universal an active job was taking place in Baku, Karabakh, Akhalkalaki and other 
regions of Azerbaijan and Georgia. In this case, the Armenian committee members with all their strength 
persuaded a certain part of such nations as the Abkhazians, Adjars, Assets and Lezghins. But let us go back to 
Turkey. 
    In 1904 Khrimyan Airik with the help of bishops O.Saranchyan and S.Aivotyan sent a messenger on 
the Armenian question to the European courts. The aim was the same "by hook or by crook!". 
     President of the French republic Lups answered that in case of emergency FO would take the 
appropriate measures.King of England Eduard VII refused to accept instigators. 
    The USA president Ruzvelt answered that he had enough of his own Armenian informers. The same 
attempts were made in 1907, when all representatives of the States refused even to meet Catholicos's 
messengers. Nothing remains but to be surprised at the long-suffering of the Turkish powers, behind the backs 
of whom such factual and frank demolition work was being led. Will any other country tolerate this. All of them 
had their home problems and they did not want "only for love of Christianity" to get mixed up in an evident 
adventure of gnchakists. And when in 1894 the Armenian organizers turned to the active diversions, the west 
had already known that in Turkey not only the Armenians suffered but the Osmans themselves as well (let us 
remember the developments in the Nagorny Karabakh. - A.M.). I think it is interesting to look at the Mejlis 
membership of the "brutal" Turkey in 1908: 
The Turks- 107 places

i.e. the Turks numbered less than a half of the total number of deputes and all this at the time when 
throughout Turkey beatings of Turks were organized, at schools and monasteries (Armenian) a large quantity of 
arms and ammunition were found. 
   When the Balkan war of 1912-1913 broke out the largest public man Pogos-Pasha Nubaryan whose 
points of view were known well made a statement at one of the meetings that "the Armenian party (he meant 
"Gnchak. -A.M.) which counteracted "Ittikhad", was the Armenian's enemy and struggled against the Armenian 
nation". 
    IN OCTOBER, 1912 I.I.VORONTSOV-DASHKOV, A VICEGERENT IN THE CAUCASUS IN HIS 
LETTER TO NICHOLAS II ADVISED HIM "TO GO BACK TO A REAL RUSSIAN POLICY - 
PROTECTION OF THE TURKISH ARMENIANS". 
    Illarion Ivanovich at the age of 75, (1837-1916), did not prevent from lia-son of his young wife with 
bishop Mesrop who by the right of an active member of the family dictated his terms to the old cuckold. 
    The Armenian historians and instigators exciting young people's minds publish much on the genocide. 
And with every decade a number of "the murdered" increases in the geometric progression. Manipulation of 
figures, rough misrepresentation of historical facts - it is a principal weapon of the Armenian falsificators whom 
as long ago as the beginning of the century unmasked above-mentioned Ilya Chavchavadze in his book "The 
Armenian scientists and screaming stones" (stones scream because of their lie and perverting of historical facts. 
-A.M.). 
   Well, reader now we shall think of the following! The state (any state. -A.M.) is having an internecine 
battle with invaders but at this time in the rear there have been found people undermining the rear with armed 
uprising and favouring defeat of the country where they live. Any state is obliged to take safety measures. The 
measures are extreme but forced and justified for the future of their people. History will tell us more about this. 
But we shall cite the authentic document: 
   "AS IT IS EVIDENT FROM THE RECENT INTERFERENCE OF THE ARMENIAN, ENGLISH, 
FRENCH AND RUSSIAN EMBASSIES IN CONSTANTINOPLE AND IN SOME PLACES THE CONSULS 
OF THESE EMBASSIES IN SECRET RECEIVE FALSE INFORMATION IN [109-110] 
SPITE OF OUR ANSWER THAT THE ARMENIANS' DEPORTATION TAKES PLACE IN 
COMPLETE SAFETY AND QUIETNESS. IT IS NOT ENOUGH TO PERSUADE THEM. 
    TAKE ALL SAFETY MEASURES AND DO YOUR BEST THAT AT THE MOMENT WHEN THE 
ARMENIANS FROM CITIES, DISTRICTS AND CENTERS ARE ON THEIR WAY THE EVENTS WOULD 
NOT TAKE PLACE ABOUT WHICH THE FOREIGNERS AND ARMENIANS THEMSELVES SPEAK SO 
MUCH. IT IS VERY IMPORTANT FROM THE POINT OF VIEW OF OUR PRESENT-DAY POLICY THE 
FOREIGNERS PASSING THROUGH THESE PLACES TO BE CONVINCED THAT THE ARMENIANS' 
DEPORTATION IS REALLY WITH THE AIM OF TRANSFERAL. AS REGARDS THOSE WHO GIVE 
INFORMATION CONCERNING THIS QUESTION I RECOMMEND YOU TO ARREST AND GIVE THEM 
TO THE COUNCIL OF WAR." 
November 18. 1915, Ministry of Internal affairs ТALAAT. 
    In spite of the fact that the Armenian plutocracy within the last 60 years has been destroying all the 
archive documents exposing their predecessors' swindles, still they cannot reach all the archives. Side by side 
with this it should be reminded that the Armenian leaders of committees and parties like "Gnchak", 
"Dashnaktsutyun" and "Ramkavar" since 1880 have never been true to the governments who intended lo help in 
making "Great Armenia". 
    On December 29, 1917 Soviet government issued a decree "On the Turkish Armenia". By this 
document Soviet government recognized officially "the right of West Armenia for free self-determination up to 
complete independence". 
    V.I.Lenin made Stepan Shaumyan responsible for realization of the decree and establishment of the 
Soviet statehood in Armenia, he was given a special warrant. Having got it he did not hurry to his native 
"Armenia" but taking advantage of the trying conditions and poor information of the central government and 
with the help of dashnak troops and Andranik's thugs he pandered to the orderly annihilation of the 
Azerbaijanian population under the flag of establishment of Soviet power in Baku.[110-111] 
   Being a clever man S.Shaumyan and his close assistants in no case could confuse the so-called "Turkish 
Armenia" wilh Azerbaijan where he had been sent by V.I.Lenin to execute the decree. 
   It is not by chance that neither S.Shaumyan nor A.Mikoyan, nor G.Amiryan intended to go to the so-
called "Turkish Armenia" to perform the commission of the world revolution leader, as they knew well whal 
cxpccfcd them there!

   The volume of the given book does not allow to cite many thousands of examples of vandalism and 
genocide of Azerbaijanians by nationalistic detachments of Armenians but still we shall remind some of them. 
   THE DEVELOPMENTS OF MARCH - APRIL, 1918, on the Azerbaijan territory. From the eye-
witnesses' accounts: "Since early morning the dashnak detachments, who have already become a skilled hand at 
murdering in neighbouring villages, burst into Baku. People hid themselves in houses and cellars. With wild 
shouts: "Kill, kill dammed Turks" they pursued after people about the whole city. People were dragged out of 
houses, cellars and killed by shooting, flows wilh sabres and lances. They broke the doors and gates, 
disemboweled pregnant women, groups of 10-15 persons raped young women juvenile girls and old women. 
Everything has been done before eyes of nearly mad men. 
   Then they gather people in a house, pour kerosene on il and set on fire first having collected all the 
jewelry. Il lasted for a month. It is unbearable lo describe the piclurcs of massacre and terror. Baku was in the 
power of people who had nothing human in them. 
    In such a way, with unbelievable cynicism the Azerbaijan nation was being annihilated. 
    The Armenian bandits killed men not at once, they tied them by feet head first and cut by sabres like 
carcass in a slaughlcr-housc. The others were tied lo the wooden beds, wrapped in carpels and set on fire. Many 
of them the bandits nailed down to the floor, doors and tables. They collected Holy Writ - Koran and made huge 
fires, where they threw moollahs alive lied by hands and feel. All this was taking place before the eyes of local 
Armenians who applauded to beatings and murders. 
   Horrible il was the picture when a dashnak detachment surrounded the building at the entry to the 
Fortress, where there were about 2 thousand of [111-112] 
the wounded and sick Azerbaijanians, Russians, Lezghins and Jews. By the order of Amazasp, whose 
right-hand man was Anastas Mikoyan, some persons poured much kerosene from the roof into windows and 
doors and another group set fire on the building turned into a large flaming bonfire from where heart-tearing 
cries were heard and the environs was filled with pungent, suffocating smell of burning human bodies". 
     According to another eye-witness, Baku citizen who watched this brutality from the roof of some 
remote building: "Through a large opening on the heap of dead bodies having already became charred I saw 
people who were crawling with wailing, they were battering, writhing with pain in awful sufferings. Then I saw 
nothing: a terrible vision disappeared in a whirlwind of smoke, spark and flame. The Armenian soldiers 
standing around this bonfire shot everybody who tried to escape. In Shemakha Amazasp and Stepan Lalayev 
committed atrocities. All the women, girls, children were outraged, dishonored, hung in the trees and smashed 
against stones. If some woman's necklace could not be taken off, her head was cut off by the blow of a knife. To 
get earnings the ears were torn off and to take bracelets the girls' hands were cut off and the girls were killed in 
their mother's arms." 
    So it has been executed V.I.Lenin;s decree "On the Turkish Armenia" and establishing of Soviet power 
in Armenia.! 
    Meanwhile, the Russian officers and soldiers having seen themselves the Armenian's brutality towards 
the Turkish population and being aware of their own responsibility began to leave the Caucasian front in mass. 
    Colonel Tverdokhlebov truthfully describes in his memoirs events of those days and you, reader, 
already know about it. 
     Butcher of the peoples Andranik, who was an outlaw by the Turkish government, at the meeting of the 
Armenian National Council on December 15, 1917 made a statement: 
   I THINK, IF THE FRONT WILL FALL TO PIECES LIKE THIS, PERHAPS WE SHOULD BE 
RECONCILED WITH THE TURKS". 
    But on December 19 he said there: "If you consider me a son of Armenia, tomorrow I'll go to 
Erzerum... I'll go with my valiant-detachment (read, with a band of thugs. - A.M.) for annihilation of the Turks 
and Azerbaijanians, Kurds and Jews and nobody will stop me".[112-113] 
   As a result of his campaign tens of thousands of people have been killed. But the tsarist army 
withdrawal in 1917-1918 made anxious the Armenian nationalistic parties and some separatistic tendencies 
began to be felt in their actions. And then on April 1918 the Turkish troops arrived in Erzindz-han, Bairut, 
Mamakhatun, Erzerum, Kars and other cities, they saw an awful picture of Armenian's atrocities. The journalists 
and photo-correspondents have been invited from England, France, the USA, Belgium, Spain, Germany, 
Austria-Hungary and other countries to get acquainted with the result of Armenian's claims on "free self-
determination". 
    ARMENIAN PARTIES NEEDED DECADES TO TURN TRUTH INTO LARGE-SCALE LIE AND 
ONLY SINCE 1960 TO TRUMPET ABOUT THE MYTH OF ARMENIAN'S "GENOCIDE". 
    Dashnaks, gnchakists, ramkavars were afraid of fair revenge on the Turk's part for innocent blood 
having been shed by them. One of the active gnchakists, later on vice-people's commissar of Foreign affairs of 
Soviet Russia L. Karakhan (Karakhanyan) being able to persuade G.Chicherin as well sent a telegram on April 
13, 1918 (i.e. at the moment of violence of the Azerbaijan's butchery in Baku and other cities. - A.M.) to the 
 52
German consul in Tiflis and demanded that Germany would warn the Turkish campaign against Azerbaijan and 
Armenia. Here is the text: "THE TURKISH ARMY IS MOVING TO BATUM, KARS, ARDAGAN. 
RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE FUTHER FATE OF ARMENIANS RESTS ON GERMANY, AS AT ITS 
URGENT REQUEST RUSSIAN TROOPS HAVE BEEN WITHDRAWN FROM ARMENIAN REGIONS 
AND AT PRESENT IT DEPENDS UPON IT TO HOLD THE TURKISH TROOPS FROM USUAL 
EXCESSES. ON THE GROUND OF REVENGE AND ANIMOSITY. (For what-revenge and animosity? - 
A.M.). It is difficult to reconcile oneself to the thought that such civilized state as Germany having every 
possibility to influence upon its allied Turkey allowed the Brest peace treaty to serve for the Armenian people, 
who had been induced to participate in the world war, as a source of disasters". 
   One can understand Levon Karakhan's feelings, his fear of inevitable revenge for mass-scale evil deeds 
and genocide of the Azerbaijan nation, committed by the Armenian "patriots". [113-114] 
    Unfortunately, while mass beating and murdering of Azerbaijanians neither a stale nor public men have 
been found in the civilized cultural Europe who would stand up for the tormented, long-suffering Azerbaijan 
people. 
    At this hard time Stcpan Shaumynn said that only Armenian dashnak forces were sufficient to repulse 
the Turks and to continue the policy. 
   Nevertheless on May 27, 1918 the Turkish army commander Khalil-pasha at the request of Kachaznuni 
and Khalisov received them and asked to inform the Armenian National Council that the Turks arc not against 
"making" Armenia in the Caucasus but on one obligatory condition - to put an end to mass-scale murders of 
civil population. Later on A.Khatisov wrote: "BAKU BECAME THE SUBJECT OF LONG MEETINGS. THE 
TURKS DEMANDED AN ACTIVE INTERFERENCE TO PUT AN END TO ANNIHILATION OF 
PEOPLE". 
   On June 4, 1918, A.Khatisov and Kachaznuni signed the peace treaty with the Turks having betrayed 
Soviet Russia again. 
    REGARDING THIS AT THE END OF OCTOBER 1918 A.IOFFE (AMBASSADOR) IN BERLIN 
MADE A STATEMENT TO THE ARMENIAN DELEGATES THAT THE COUNCIL OF PEOPLE'S 
COMMISSARS COULD NOT RECOGNIZE THE GOVERNMENT OF ARMENIA, AS THE LATTER HAD 
NOT RECOGNIZED THE SOVIET GOVERNMENT OF MOSCOW. 
   Thus, the Armenians repaid in ingratitude to V.I.Lenin. You cannot help shuddering while reading 
materials of those davs. 
    "WHEN NOTORIOUS HEAD OF THE BAND OF ROBBERS DEAL ING WITH KIDNAPPING OF 
CHILDREN TATEVOS AMIROV (one of 26 Baku commissars?! A.M.) HAVING BECOME A HEAD OF 
"SOCIALIST" ARMY HAS SLAUGHTERED ABOUT SIXTEEN THOUSAND OF DEFENSELESS 
MOSLEM POOR PEOPLE IN BAKU AND MARTY-NOV'S BOON COMPANION, CUR STYOPA 
LALAEV AT THE HEAD OF DASHNAK (ALSO "SOCIALIST") BANDS HAS CLEARED SOME 
BLOCKS OF MOSLEM INTELLIGENTSIA REPRESENTATIVES WHOM HE DRAGGED OUT OF 
HOUSES AND KILLED IN THE STREET, SHAUMYAN AND OTHER "LEADERS OF DEMOCRACY" 
SIMILAR TO HIM FOUND THIS PROBATION TO BE BRILLIANT FOR THEIR COM- [114-115] 
MANDERS AND AMIROV WITH LALAEV WERE NOMINATED TO SHEMAKHA WITH A 
SELECTED DASHNAK DETACHMENT TO STRUGGLE WITH COUNTER-REVOLUTIONARIES". 
(Newspaper"Azerbaijan", Octobers, 1918, No.4), 
     We don't know what has happened to Shemakha, but we know that "red-socialistic" detachment with 
"socialists" Amirov and Lalaev at the head have slaughtered the Moslem population of the whole Shemakha and 
smashed up 40 villages. 
   All terrors seen by us over this war period pale by the side of atrocity performed by Lalaev upon 
Shemakha Moslems. 
    This crime was so terrible that could nol-remain in secret like other actions of dashnak bands. It was 
spoken about and even the report from Shemakha was published in Bolshevik newspaper, where Lalacv's evil 
deed was characterized by the expression: "... AND HAS BEEN ALLOWED SOME INJUSTICE TOWARDS 
CIVILIANS. GENERAL ANNIHILATION OF MOSLEM POPULATION, DISEMBOWELING OF 
PREGNANT WOMEN, MONSTROUS OUTRAGES UPON GIRLS, BURNING THEM ALIVE IN 
MOSQUES, ETC. - ALL THIS DASHNAKTZAKANS CALL "SOME INJUSTICE". 
   However hard Shaumyan's government tried they could not conceal Shemakha crimes. 
   It has been set up an Extraordinary military-investigation commission headed by Kozhemyako, one of 
the members being a Moslem. THE RESULT OF THEIR WORK WAS AN INDICTMENT AGAINST 
S.LALAEV AS ORGANIZER OF EXTERMINATION OF INNOCENT CIVILIANS AND ARSON OF THE 
TOWN. This criminal had to be arrested. But "Baku socialists" appeared to have "short arms" for dashnaktsakan 
bandits. 
 53
... WHEN KOZHEMYAKO INVITED S.LALAEV TO COME AND DE GLARED ABOUT HIS 
ARREST, HE CURSED HIM, RANG S.SHAUMYAN UP WHO CALLED KOZHEMYAKO TO THE 
TELEPHONE AND SAID THE FOLLOWING: "TO ARREST LALAEV IS NOT CONVENIENT. WHAT 
PRANKS ARE THESE?BY SUCH WORDS "AN IDEOLOGICAL LEADER OF DEMOCRACY" STOOD 
UP FOR A CRIMINAL AND LALAEV, AS IF NOTHING HAD TAKEN PLACE WENT FOR A WALK 
[115-116] 
ALONG VELIKOKNYAZHESKY PROSPECT ACCOMPANIED BY HIS BODY-GUARDS FROM 
DASHNAKTSAKAN BUREAU. AND WHAT ABOUT TRIAL? IN 3-4 DAYS IN NEWSPAPERS THERE 
WAS INFORMATION THAT THE EXTRAORDINARY MILITARY-INVESTIGATION COMMISSION 
HAS BEEN ABOLISHED." 
(Newspaper "Azerbaijan October 21, 1918 the article "From the recent past. Shaumyan and La- 
laev"). 
    Some months later the same newspaper wrote: 
    "WHEN RETREATING OF THE TURKISH TROOPS ON THE CAUCASIAN FRONT THE 
TURKISH ARMENIANS JOINED THE CAUCASIAN AND TOGETHER THEY BEGAN TO ATTACK ON 
THE RETREATING MILITARY UNITS AND TO PURSUE THEM. ON THE ONE HAND, ANDRANIK'S 
DETACHMENTS ACTED, ON THE OTHER-OF DRO, KERI, MURAD. ALL THE DESERTED MOSLEM 
VILLAGES WERE ROBBED AND DESTROYED... " 
    AT THE SAME TIME DUE TO SHAUMYAN'S AND AVAKYAN'S PROVOCATIONS IN 
SHEMAKHA EVENTS RAN HIGH. THE LETTER WRITTEN BY SHAUMYAN CONCERNING THIS 
FELL INTO THE HANDS OF GANDJA COMMANDANT. IT IS CLEAR FROM THIS LETTER THAT 
SHAUMYAN AND AVAKYAN ARE DASHNAKS OF THE FIRST WATER... (Later A.Mikoyan managed 
to steal the original letter from archives but the newspaper has been kept! - A.M.). The band headed by Stepka 
Lalaev at nights attacked on Moslem houses, took away the arms from people and beatcd them. JUST THE 
SAME SAILORS DID. SUCH SITUATION WAS GOING ON SINCE JANUARY UP TO MARCH. TILL 
MARCH 21 THE MOSLEMS WERE ANNIHILATED AND BEATING WAS OVER AFTER DEMAND OF 
THE 36 TH TURKESTAN DETACHMENT AND INTERFERENCE OF DZHAPARIDZE, A REPRE-
SENTATIVE OF THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE. MILITARY SHIP "ARDAGAN" AND 
"KRASNOVODSK" CAME UP TO THE EAST DOCKS AND THREATENED TO OPEN GUN-FIRE AT 
THE ARMENIAN PART OF THE TOWN IF THE MOSLEM'S MASSACRE WAS NOT OVER. THUS, 
DARK FORCES HAVE BEEN RESTRAINED.[116-117] 
     Says another witness: "On March 20, I saw Tatevos Amirov with 3 armed Armenians entering the 
building "Ismailiye" and soon I saw the flame and the building was burnd". 
    AND AGAIN ONLY INTERFERENCE OF DZHAPARIDZE: PREVENTED TATEVOS FROM 
SETTING FIRE TO THE BUILDINGS ,     OF GIRL'S SCHOOL AND MUNICIPAL DUMA. 
                                                                             (Newspaper"Azerbaijan", March 17, 1919). 
    Still under pressure of Armenian millionaires and gnchakists on August 27, 1918 it was signed an 
additional treaty (to Brest) between Soviet Russia and Germany. According to this treaty the German 
government was obliged to influence on the Turkish government and to withdraw their troops out of  Baku and 
its adjacent regions. But it could mean only the following – to leave the Azerbaijan people to the mercy of fate, 
in other words-to be torn to pieces by the frantic gang of dashnaks-gnchakists. 
    Side by side with this the Armenian circles tried to do their best to disavow the shameful events in 
Azerbaijan with hope to conceal their crimes. 
   So on July 23, 1918 when the Armenian delegation in Istambul was waiting for answer of the 
government of Turkey and Germany, Pogos Nubar-pasha published in Paris a letter to Klemanso, the Prime 
Minister of France. Thus, on the one hand, Avetis Agaranyan and others asked in Istambul on behalf of tire 
Armenian people to be recognized by Turkey, on the other hand-Pogos Nubar connected the problem of "Great 
Armenia" existence with the government of England, France and USA. 
    Double-faced policy of Armenians has come to light. Petersburg, Istambul and English newspapers and 
state circles expressed their perplexity and indignation at the fact that Armenians made a fool of their states. The 
situation was going to the evident discredit of the Armenian committee members who had already bad 
reputation. 
    Then Alexander Khatisov had to make a statement that only officials of Armenia could speak on behalf 
of the Armenian people. 
   Public opinion of Europe was gradually polarized and not in favour of Armenians. The active anti-
popular Armenian's position in revolutionary Baku, criminal actions of Andranik, activity of Pogos Nubar in 
Paris, diplomatic activity of Armenian representatives (Ogadzhanyan, Zurabyan) in [117-118] 
Berlin, displaying of anti-Russian attitude - all this persuaded European states that the "Armenian 
problem" would be for ever, at any rate, at least, for hundred years. 
 54
    In these tragic days for the Azerbaijan people, at last, the people's democratic parly "Musavat" has been 
organized, it existed only for two years and saved their nation of complete annihilation. 
   Meanwhile, Andranik who could not blockade Baku at the call of A.Shaumyan, began even larger 
massacre of the Azerbaijanians and Georgians in Nakhichevan, in all the regions of Erivan province, Zangezur, 
Arazdan, in Akhaltsy, Akhalkalak, Borchaly districts of Tiflis province. 
   Dashnaks and gnchakists felt the imminent end of their adventure and on June 1, 1918 on behalf of 
Baku Soviet they published address to the workers and peasants of the Transcaucasus and called not to allow 
moving of Turkish troops towards Baku. It is not clear how the signatures of S.Shaumyan, Avakyan and 
G.Korganov were found under this address. 
   But they failed to deceive people once more, for there have not been clotted yet rivers and lakes of 
blood, where they ruined above 400 thousand of Azerbaijanians, 120 thousand of Georgians, 15 thousand of 
Kurds, 22 thousand of Lezghins ct al. The facts of violence, vandalism and genocide were so evident that when 
on August 31, 1918 the government of Armenia in Erivan gave a ceremonial reception to Commander of 
Turkish troops Khalil-pasha, THE HEAD OF DASHNAK GOVERNMENT BEGGED HIS PARDON AND 
PROMISED TO PUT ON TRIAL OF PEOPLES THE LEADERS AND ACTIVE PARTICIPANTS OF MASS-
SCALE MURDERS. 
    Moreover, in November 1918 to separate themselves completely from Andranik, Manukyan, 
Kachaznuni and Saakyan-the most influential statesmen of the Armenian government promised Moscow, 
Istambul and Berlin that IF ANDRANIK "ENTERED ARMENIA TERRITORY HE WOULD BE DISARMED 
AND COURT-MARTIALLED". 
   After this Andranik, an English and Armenian agent taken valuables robbed by him, settled down in 
America where he lived till his death in 1927 guarded by his thugs, 680 in number. 
   Dashnak Armenia tried to do their best to pose as a fighting country, "a small ally" of Anlanta. These 
refinements had a single aim-to snap off "a piece of pie". The question is of the following. [118-119] 
 
   In January - June, 1919 in Paris the Conference took place on the changing of Osman Empire frontiers 
by Antanta States and two Armenian delegations were sent there. One of them was headed by Pogos Nubar-
Pasha, on a commission from Catholicos, the second - Avetis Agranyan as a representative of Armenian 
Republic. Both delegations had not got the right to take part in the conference, as Armenia was not recognized 
as a fighting side. With the best will in the world the countries did not want to soil their name as supporters of 
atrocity committed by Armenians against the Kurds, Russians, Turks, Azerbaijanians, Georgians and other 
nations. 
   But at the conference the allotment was taking place al full speed: England seized the domains of 
Bagdad and Mosul (now Iraq) Palestine, present Jordan, was struggling fiercely for its control over Istambul and 
straits. 
   France captured Lebanon and a part of Syria, Kielikiya. 
   The USA also had a claim on Istambul, straits and present Armenia territory. One can understand and be 
convinced in Armenian chameleon policy while reading the letter by Ovanes Kachaznuni to Alexander 
Khalisov: 
   "Dear Alexander Ivanovich! I have learned about the course and result of negotiations with very clever 
messengers of Nubar. I am sorry that they haven't come to an agreement but I am very glad that youO'd like to 
say-wc)arcn'l faulty. In truth and with conscience you have gone by the way of concessions so far that there is 
no way farther. You arc completely aware of responsibility resting on You and you have done your best to 
eradicate the internal conflicts hampering our business. SHAME ON THE HEADS OF NUBAR 
SUPPORTERS, WHO .COULDN'T UNDERSTAND THAT WHILE THERE IS RUSSIAN AND SOVIET 
DIPLOMACY, WE, THE ARMENIANS, SHALL BE USED IN EVERY POSSIBLE WAY. 
   THE NECESSITY OF COLLABORATION WITH WISE PEOPLE, HAVING PATRIOTIC 
FEELINGS BOTH IN THE MOTHERLAND AND ABROAD REMAINS VALID. 
   WE MUST CONTINUE ACHIEVING THIS COLLABORATION. IT IS NECESSARY FOR US NOT 
ONLY NOW BUT IN FUTURE AS WELL, WHEN WE ESTABLISH INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS, 
MAINLY, FINANCIAL-ECONOMIC. 
   THIS WE MUST REMEMBER WELL AND TO HAND THE BATON TO FUTURE 
GENERATIONS.   (And they have handed to the Mikoyans,  [119-120] 
Shakhnazarovs, Brutyans, Sitaryans, Aganbekyans and other adherents of "the Armenian problem. - 
A.M.) 
   BUT SO WELL WE MUST REMEMBER THAT NEITHER NUBAR, NOR HIS CLOSE ADVISER 
MUST BE ADMITTED TO POWER IN INDEPENDENT ARMENIA. TO THESE TWO NAMES I'LL ADD 
ONE NAME MORE, NAME OF ANDRANIK, THIS IMPUDENT MAN AND A MURDERER WHO HAD 
 55
STOLEN 46 MILLION ROUBLES. Such people must be shot as national criminals and broken with once and 
for ever. 
   Ramkavars without Nubar, Zhogovurdakyans without Papadzhanov and the Turkish Armenians without 
Andranik - such must be our program of agreement in future. February 7, 1920. Yours O.V.Kachaznuni". 
   When on August 10, 1920 in Tiflis Boris Vasilevich Legran, (1884-1936) - head of the mission of 
Soviet Russia in Armenia on the one and representatives of dashnak government A.Dzhamalyan and A.Babayan 
- on the other hand, entered into an agreement on ceasing military operations between the Red army units and 
dashnak troops it became evident even for Moscow that Armenian Republic government behaved like the most 
greedy merchant whose goods was the fate of long-suffering Armenian people. 
Namely for this and other reasons as well by V.I.Lenin's instruction Soviet government gave military and 
financial help to Turkey. 
   In summer, 1920 about 6 thousand of guns, above 5 million of gun cartridges and 17600 shells were 
sent at the disposal of G.K.Ordzhonikidze, a member of Revolutionary Council of War of the Caucasian front 
for the subsequent passing them to the representatives of Great National meeting of Turkey. In September, 1920 
about 200.6 kg of gold in billions was handed over to the Turkish government and Commanders. 
   In January - February 1921 a representative of Turkish mission in Tuapse was handed over 1000 of 
bombs, 1000 of detonating fuses, 1000 charges, 4000 garnel and 4000 of shrapnel cartridges. 
   When concluding Soviet-Turkish treaty in Moscow on March 16, 1921 the agreement was reached on 
giving a gratutous help to Turkey. Accordingly the Soviet government sent in 1921 at the disposal of the 
Turkish government 33275 of guns, 57986000 cartridges, 327 of machine-guns, 54 pieces of ordnance, 127479 
of shells, 1500 of sabres, 20000 of respirators and a large amount of another military outfit.[120-121] 
    On October 3, 1921 the Turkish Military Command in Trapezund was given two fighters. The Soviet 
government (read - Vladimir Ilych Lenin -A.M.) in 1921 handed over to the Turkish National meeting 6.5 
million of roubles in gold, in April - 4 millions, in May - June -1.4 million, in November -1.1 million. In May, 
1922 the Turkish government was handed over 3.5 mln. of roubles in gold. In 1922 the Soviet government 
continued to supply Turkey with arms and military stuff. 
("Documents of the USSR Foreign Policy", vol.III, Notes, page 675). 
  When on April 26, 1920 (i.e. in three days after opening the Great National meeting) Kemal Atatyurk 
sent a letter to Moscow for V.I.Lenin, where he set forth the main principles of foreign policy of new Turkey, 
asked to help it and offered to establish regular diplomatic relations, V.I.Lenin on behalf of the Soviet 
government confirmed the act of mutual recognition of both states and made a statement that "the Soviet 
government is happy to lay the foundation of friendship, which had to unite the Turkish and Russian peoples". 
  Note that there was not a single word about "genocide", perhaps a myth about it had not been composed 
yet, as well as about Sumgait. It will take place later when for "genocide" substantiation fabricated books, 
publications, false witnesses are required. 
   Such are the historical facts which must be known not only to the Boro-viks, Sakharovs, Staraovoitovas, 
Gamzatpvs, Popovs and Kazannikovs but all those who want to know the truth, let it be even bitter and 
distressing for the authors of myths who had composed them. 
   And only with establishment of the Soviet power on November 29, 1920 the Armenian people have 
achieved peace and at last could begin their creative life 
   However soon, i.e. on January 12, 1921 George Chicherin wrote I.Stalin that dashnaks were carrying 
negotiations with the Turks and could be at the head of power again. Then in January, 1921 Anastas Mikoyan 
complained to V.I.Lenin with G.Chicherin and informed him that "Simon Vratsyan is a staunch Communist and 
adheres to our (it is interesting to which. - A.M.) ideas, the fate of the Soviet power IS IN QUITE RELIABLE 
HANDS". [121-122] 
   Present-day "patriots of Great Armenia" prefer keeping silence of this fact, as already on January 15, 
1921 "this staunch Communist" Simon Vrat-syan headed anti-soviet uprisal in Armenia and again blood began 
to be shed of hundreds of thousands of Azerbaijanians and honest Armenian patriots. 
   Urgent drastic measures had to be taken. AND THEN, BY V.I.LENIN'S INSTRUCTION IN 
MOSCOW IN 1921, THE SOVIET-TURKISH TREATY WAS CONCLUDED. 
   Representatives of already Soviet Armenia ignored these negotiations and despite numerous invitations 
they did not come to Moscow, thereby they frankly displayed mistrust and hostility towards V.I.Lenin's govern-
ment. 
   According to Moscow treaty the indigenous Turkish lands, such as: Kars, Ardagan, Kagyzman, Oltin 
and Arlvin districts, south part of Batum district, Surman district of Erivan province have been left to Turkey. 
Knowing the Armenian extremist tricks, to suppress in future territorial claims some special article was included 
into treaty, according to which Nakhichevan had to form "autonomous territory under protectorate of 
Azerbaijan, on condition that Azerbaijan did not cede the protectorate to some other country". 
 56
   V.I.Lenin was anxious about position of Soviet Armenia leaders and at his urgent request on October 
13, 1921 in Kars with participation of RSFSR the treaty was concluded between the Armenian, Azerbaijan and 
Georgian Soviet Socialist Republics on the one hand and Turkey - on the other hand. 
This treaty repeated all the clauses of Moscow treaty. It may seem that i's have been dotted. 
   However, some group of extremists could manage in every possible way to convoke the International 
conference dedicated to national minorities. 
   In one of the conference resolutions it was said that the League of Nations must guarantee the safety of 
national minorities. The conference participants slated the fact of 950 thousand of Armenians living in Islambul, 
Izmir and other parts of Asia Minor and Syria. A row has been made. Well, according to the statement of 
ringleaders of "the Armenian question" after that notorious genocide not a single Armenian out of 1 million 285 
thousand had to stay in Turkey and other countries. [122-123] 
    Where have these 950 thousand come from? Unfortunately, "genocide" myth skilfully fabricated gets 
support and understanding of some trustful and naive-people in our country too, among whom there are such 
ardent heralds of "genocide" as Genrikh Borovick, academician Sakharov and his wife - Alikhanyan. Some 
present-day historians of Armenia do not lose the chance to use broadcasting for discussing unpunished 
atrocities of the Turks, Azerbaijanians, Georgians and "tsarist Russians" (it is something new! - A.M.) and 
peoples of these countries, in general, against" oppressed "Armenians". Let it be so. But it is beyond any 
understanding how Atalurk having come into power condemned such criminals and bandits as Javid-bcy, ex-
minister of finances Nazym-bey, ex-minister of education, Khilmi-bcy, former deputy of Mejlis Nail-bey, 
former member of "Iltikhad" party. 
   In Izmir some members of party "Ittikhad" have been hung, general K.Karabekiri and Ali Fuad Jebesoi - 
close companions of Mustafa Kemal were prosecuted, altogether 49 "Ittikhad" members were tried for deport-
ation carried out in some estates. 
   Any nation is not free of their own scoundrels and rascals. Have Russian people general Vlasov's 
betrayal on their conscience? Have the German people been condemned by the International Court in Nurnbcrg? 
The conscience of a nation in the person of its best sons has always been embodiment of people objectivity and 
wisdom. It is because of this the best sons of Turkish and Azerbaijan nations V.I.Lenin and Mustafa Kcmal lay 
down the foundation for close friendship of two peoples. 
   It is should be added to the abovesaid that neither dashnak nor Soviet government of Armenia 
condemned a single criminal who had steeped his hands in blood of peoples. By the way, not a single extremist-
chauvinist of the events in 1988 - 1989 has suffered, on the contrary, the most ardent provocateurs of national 
hostility, such as Genrikh Borovik, Andrei Sakharov, Zory Balayan, Genrikh Pogosyan, Sergei Dadamyan - 
became the USSR people's deputies. 
   It is striking that all honest people, Communists, internationalists are indignant their best feelings are 
profaned, but they can do nothing. If it goes on like that, we won't be surprised at the election to the USSR 
Supreme So- [123-124] 
viet of the members of nationalistic society "Pamyat". I think that the history will tell its objective word. 
    In 1926 Andranik-pasha published his interview: "I shall return once more" where he in the most 
impudent manner calumniated the USSR, held up to shame its policy towards Armenians. 
   Here is one example from his "revelations": "We should always know and never forget that the most 
malicious enemy of the Armenian people is the Russians and the Communist regime". 
    As events of 1988-1989 show there is no difference between embittered and violent antisovietchiks 
abroad and their secret followers in the USSR. 
    And what is typical: liberal and indulgent relation towards Armenian plutocracy's trick then and at 
present have resulted in tragic consequences. I think it is too early to dot "i". Is it necessary to speak about the 
extremist appeals and actions of the Aganbegyans, Balayans, Petrosyans, Khachatu-rovs, Vazgcns who led to 
the tragedy of whole nation and were a chain reaction for national-chauvinistic uprisals in other regions of the 
country. 
   What for do we intentionally let the evil spirit out of bottle and then by all means including repressive 
ones up to mass-scale murdering of demonstrators (developments in Sumgait, Tbilisi, Fergana, Kokand in April 
- May, 1989) we try to drive it in. 
   Is not too late the decree of the Supreme Soviet Presidium on punishment for state crimes is stirring up 
of national hatred? And if it is late then it is high time to leave off occupying observation indifferent position 
afld instead of appealing to senses to punish by the sword of revolution all the dregs of society attracting us 
away from solution of important economic, social and political problems. 
   If it docs not take place in the nearest future then one should not wonder that this misanthropic process 
will still oroaden and deepen infecting new regions of the country with incurious bacilli. 
    Our country historically grew and became powerful not under hothouse conditions but in the struggle 
with frank and secret enemies of socialism. 
 57
Has really our weapon- internationalism become dull? [124-125] 
 58
CHAPTER III 
 
OUR POWER IS IN INTERNATIONALISM 
 
"Historic merits, — arc judged nol by  
the results which political figures have  
hot yielded in comparison with modern  
requirements but by what new they  
have revealed in comparison with their 
 predecessors." 
(Complete works by V.I.Lenin, v.2, p. 78) 
    The Communists, Soviet people, all progressive mankind welcomed the decisions of the XXII Congress 
of the USSR Communist party, XIX All -Union Party Conference, of the 1—st Congress of the USSR people's 
deputies having traced an innovatory, really Leninist course for cardinal acceleration of social—economic 
development of the country in all the fields of life including improvement of social— class and inter—ethnic 
relations. In the Congress and in the Conference documents there is a long — term program of actions 
ircalization of large—scale problems confronting our people and party. [125-126] 
   And no doubt, these important tasks will be settled. However, it is necessary, as it was stressed at the 
All—Union forums, for every citizen who was grown and educated on our Communist ideology and morals and 
enjoying all welfares of the society, to devote their life to the common cause and successfully to overcome the 
events of national narrow—mindedness. 
    As it is known, already V.I.Lenin printed to inadmissibility for any displaying of nationalism, attempts 
with the help of falsification of facts to glorify "own" history by keeping silence and frank insult of national 
feelings of other peoples. 
   At the dawn of the Soviet power he wrote: 
    "Who wants to serve the proletariat, he must unite the workers of all nations, steadily struggling with 
bourgeois nationalism both with "ours"and foreign. Who defends the slogan of national culture — his place is 
among nationalistic phillislincs but not among the Marxists... 
    Marxism is irreconcillablc to nationalism whether it is the most "just" "pure", refined and civilized. 
Marxism puts forward internationalism -— union of all nations — instead of nationalism." 
(V. I.Lenin. "Critical notes on the national problem", Cospolilizdat, 1988, p.8, 
  Mikhail Sergeevich Gorbachev in his political report at the XXII Congress expressing the Communist 
party wish demonstrated his steady adherence to Leninism principles: 
   "Our party tradition following Lenin is a special tactfulness and discretion in everything that concerns 
national policy, that touches interests of every nation and nationality, national feelings of people and at the same 
time it is a principal struggle against national narrow—mindedness and conceit, nationalism and chauvinism, 
whatever forms they take. We, the Communists, must follow Lenin's wise behests, apply them under new 
conditions, to be to the utmost attentive, principle in the national relations for the sake of further consolidation 
of fraternal friendship of all peoples in the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics". 
   In this concluding remarks at the I-st Congress of the USSR people's deputies having been elected as the 
president of the country M.S.Gorbachev on behalf of all Soviet people said: [126-127] 
   "Only on the ground of reason and law, and, I am repeating once more, of wide—spread dialogue it is 
possible to resolve the accumulated problems in this critical at present sphere of human relations. But towards 
those who don't heed the reasons of mind and the norms of right the law must be applied firmly and resolutely". 
   Thus, when the position is defined, now wc need concrete revolutionary actions, as during two years the 
admonition and appeals to extremists have not yielded and do not yield any results. But in Alma-Ata and Tbilisi 
since the very first days such decisive measures have been taken that all the peoples shuddered from the 
efficient, organized and resolute primitive actions of the army. 
   In the light of these directions, as a Communist and citizen of the USSR, I think that a principle party 
lawful estimation must be given henceforth to any kind of nationalistic actions as they arouse morbid feelings, 
play into our ideological enemy's hands, pairing the way for shameless slander of various transoceanic and 
European "voices" on the Lenin's national policy of the CPSU. Unfortunately, in our country within last 20—25 
years a number of publications has been still growing of some Armenian writers and journalists in the pages 
both of Republican and Moscow newspapers, magazines and others with statements of frankly nationalistic 
character. 
   In them they reset the program directions of the bourgeois—nationalistic parlies"Dashnaklsutyun" and 
"Gnchak" on establishing of "Great Armenia from the sea to the sea" and make demands of revision the USSR 
territory-state structure. 
 59
   In this case, they adopted experience of last decades when "the protectors" of interests of some part of 
the Armenian plutocracy but not people by their unreasoned and unsubstantiated statements provoked 
unruliness, armed uprisings, robbery and bandilism. 
   Even A.I.Volsky, the Chairman of NKAR special management by reasons known only to him says: 
"...Well, we can't deny that in the national—territorial structure of our country there is also such a thing: in 
many cases we deal with the consequences of Stalinism, anti—democratic, anti-national settlement of people's 
fate. To recognize the stability, inviolability of contemporary territorial system of the country is to recognize the 
justice and substantiation of that regime which has led socialism in other spheres to hard deformations. And if 
today we are restoring historical and political jus- [127-128] 
tice in relation to separate citizens, it means moreover we must restore the same justice towards whole 
nations". 
(newspaper "Socialist Industry•", April 10, 1989). 
     Two months have passed since that shameful statement when a new wave of events appeared. There 
have begun mass beating of the Azerbaijanians in NKAR, murdering of children, armed attacks on villages. 
    The USSR people's deputy from Azerbaijan, A.I.Volsky seemed to understand his main task in 
retaining tensity and dangerously explosive situation in order to keep the balance of his status. Having studied 
well history of the region, nevertheless, flirting with Moscow lobby, as it is on his future service will depend, A. 
Volsky made a statement: "...Discrepant, ambiguous order of the Transcaucasus at the beginning of 20-s have 
resulted in the fact that Nagorny Karabakh with its Armenian population became a part of Azerbaijan (?! — 
how to understand A.I.Volsky's perverting of available historical documents where it is distinctly written to 
leave as a part of Azerbaijan - A.M.). 
(newspaper "Izvestiya", 1989). 
    However we must remember that he has been sent to NKAR by the party and Government and he is not 
a circus actor who can give pleasure to public by his stunting. 
   Having been brought to light by glasnost and democratization political businessmen and "ideologists" of 
anti—Soviet provocation in Armenia and Azerbaijan prepared widely and deeply , namely: Abel Aganbekyan, 
Sergei Mikojan, Gcvorg Garibdzhanyan, Sero Khanzadian, Sylvia Kaputikyan, Vardges Petrosyan, Suren 
Aivazyan, Bagrat Ulubabyan, Zory Balayan, general Arutyunov and many others are a new and younger 
generation of producers and managers in the hackneyed and disclosed long ago play entitled "the Armenian 
problem". At the beginning of the XX-th century a powerful stimulation of stirring up national hatred of the 
Transcaucasian people became THE ARMENIAN SOCIAL—DEMOCRATIC PARTY, the founders of which 
were the Armenians who were from Tiflis, Karabakh and Baku by birth. Having settled down in Berlin, Geneva 
and other European cities they published newspapers of nationalistic type. In fact, the Armenian Social—
democrats were puppet mouthpiece of "the Dashnaktsutyun" and "the Gnchak". Sincerely supporting party 
demand on inadmissibility of [128-129] 
"blank spaces" in history I must remark that some time S.G.Shaumyan, A. O.Mikoyan, Melikyan, 
Vardanyan, Andranik—pasha and other "patriots of Great Armenia" edited and contributed these newspapers. 
    Their program was characterized by the following: 
   1.Establishment of "Great Armenia from the sea (Mediterranian) to the sea(Black and Caspean)", owing 
to this it was suggested annexing of the lands belonging from the time immemorial to the Russian», Georgian, 
Azerbaijan and other peoples of the Crimea, Asia Minor and the Transcaucasus, namely: 
   a)  establishment within the Turkish Empire—Armenia, governed on the autonomic basis; 
    b)  reservation of Turkey sovereignty, which would be expressed only in approval of governor—
general elected by the Powers. Some interference into home affairs of Armenia or keeping of the Turkish army 
there would not be admissablc; 
   c)  the protectorate over Armenia on the part of three Powers of Antanta; 
   d)  the territory of Armenia that would include six Armenian vilayets (excluding some parts in the West 
and South inhabited almost only by the Moslems) and Kilikiya with a port in Mcrsin, excluding the whole 
Aleksandret gulf with Yumurlalik..." 
("International relations in the imperialism age", V, VII, p.457) 
   From Nakhichevan and Karabakh lands it was "mercifully" suggested only the capture of Khankendy 
village (now Stepanakert — A.M.), as in the rest part of Karabakh the Azerbaijan population prevailed. And 
only in Khankcndy about 70 thousand of the arrived Armenians lived. By the way, before the migration of the 
Armenians to Karabakh about 350 thousand of the Azerbaijanians lived them. It is not a secret for everybody 
that the Azerbaijan population in general and in Karabakh, in particular, grows due to the natural increase. And 
here is the disastrous policy of Stalin, Mikoyan and Beria within some decades has brought about sad results. 
The Azerbaijanians were driven away from their native and historical Motherland. This was favoured to a great 
extent by the leaders of Azerbaijan. As extremists with A. Volsky benevolence did not allow the State 
 60
Committee of Statistics in 1989 to carry out the census of the population that had taken place in the whole 
Soviet Union, it is possible only to suppose that at present only about [129-130] 
60 thousand of Azerbaijanians and 110 thousand of Armenians live in NKAR. 
    e) — understanding that newspaper publications were not sufficient to achieve their aim, "the 
Dashnaktsutyun" in 1912 organized" the Armenian National Bureau" to take an active part in the war on the part 
of Antanta. 
   A. Lalayan, a well—known historian writes in his work "The Counter— revolutionary Dashnaktsutyun 
and the imperialistic war of 1914—1918": 
"National bureau"being an actual instrument of the "Dashnaktsutyun"included: 
BISHOP MESROP, the chief and leader of Tiflis Armenian bourgeois and lover of wife of Vorontsov—
Daskov, tsar's vicegerent in the Caucasus. 
ALEXANDER KHATISOV, one of the most active leaders of dashnak party, later on the head of 
dashnak government (1918—1920), a butcher of the Transcaucasian peoples. 
DOCTOR ZAVRIEV (Akop Zavaryan), the chief of foreign affairs of "the Dashnaktsutyun". 
SAMSON ARUTYUNOV, the leader of the dashnak armed band, THUG DRO and ADVENTURER 
ANDRANIK." 
("Historic notes of the USSR Academy of Sciences", 1936). 
   Lenin's genius as if foreseeing their subsequent and present—day impudent and provocative actions 
even then warned true Bolsheviks of the Caucasus of harmf ulness of these organizations. 
   V.I.Lenin saw that these parties being a weapon of the church and bourgeoisie were gaining much force. 
    Just therefore the Bolsheviks—Leninists were indignant when they found out that Catholicos of all 
Armenians Gevorg V on August 4, 1914 addressed to bloody butcher of Russia — tsar Nicholas with request to 
guarantee Armenia territory and autonomous self—government when the war was over (i.e. annexing of other 
people territory in favour of the Armenians - A.M.) 
    By the way, something about the Catholicoses! They have always served the Armenian plutocracy and 
represented their interests. It excites surprise a frank instigating speech of Vazgen I who during the Great 
Patriotic War kept in touch with fascist general Antoncsku at any rate Antonesku made a decision to deport the 
Armenians from Romania, however, first bishop [130-131] 
Usuki and then Vazgen arranged matters with fascist butcher of the Rumanian people. 
("New time" magazine, Moscow, 1988) 
    Since what time did the Armenian church in the USSR begin to interfere into state affairs? And what 
will happen if after the example of the Armenian church some mosques, kirks and synagogues go in for politics? 
I should like to notice that a great part of instigating propaganda belongs namely to Vazgen I and his assistants 
and thus, the developments in Erevan, Stepanakert, Mardakert and Gadrut became a natural and inevitable result 
of that psychology which SOME PART OF THE ARMENIAN PEOPLE HAD ABSORBED FOR DECADES. 
THERE IS NO DOUBT THAT THIS ; PSYCHOLOGY HAD TO FIND ITS REALIZATION AND HAS 
FOUND. On days sorrowful and hard for all the Soviet people some more refined ring leaders of inter—ethnic 
discord were rubbing their hands with joy. They are the above mentioned Sergo Mikoyan, Vardges Petrosyan, 
Sylvia Kaputiky-an, academicians Aganbekyan and Garibdzhanyan, Surcn Aivazyan, general Arutyunov, Scro 
Khanzadyan, Bagrat Ulubabyan and Zory Balayan. You see, these hypocrites and Paruir Airikyan, Igor 
Muradyan, Sergei Grigoryants having joined them, showed their adherence to reactionary and chauvinistic ideas 
of the church and "diaspora". 
    It is noteworthy that they, like their remote ancestors, always become active in difficult periods for that 
country where they live. Instead of helping the CP Central Committee of Armenia to draw correct conclusions 
from the critics heard at the June plenum of the CPSU CC (1987) and doing their best to struggle with 
corruption, bribery, protectionism spread in Armenia like the rust, they took the only road applicable for them: 
to undermine the society, to attract the party and state away from the urgent economic and international 
problems. So they were preparing! So they were waitingJAs well as their ancestors abroad. While all our 
country was taking measures to ensure world peace, dashnaks and gnchakists were rejoicing and calling all the 
Armenians for "unity". 
   Let us listen to "the Dashnaktsutyun" of those days: 
   "In future great armed clash of nationalities everybody, without exception, will have to take part either 
directly or indirectly. We belong to the first group of nationalities. No doubt, in case when storms come, by all 
means, they will also have an echo in our country (Armenia is meant — A.M.) and  [131-132] 
will influence on our fate as well. The historical events have connected our fates with the country (the 
USSR — A.M.), WHICH WILL BE THE AXIS OF FUTURE GREAT CLASHES. Political storms are going 
to run high around it and IT IS SILLY TO THINK THAT THE STRUGGLING NATIONS CAN LEAVE 
RUSSIA IN PEACE. On the contrary, THE STRUGGLE WILL TAKE PLACE AROUND ONE THE SIXTH 
PART...".  
 61
("Uisaber" newspaper, organ of "the Dashnaktsutyun" in Egypt, November 11, 1935). 
    For the sake of objectivity, it should be noted that these words appeared to be prophetical, the events in 
Erevan, Stepanakert, Martuni, Gadrut are striking confirmation to this. 
    Dashnaks, gnchakists and other anti—Soviet raskals in every possible way praised Hitler, his "historic 
mission" towards the USSR, deposited millions at a fascism treasury. But Hitler "deceived", "did a bad turn" to 
fawning oracles twice, first, he was heavily beaten by the Soviet people, second, he gave not very high praise to 
them in 1943 when he was offered to set up the Armenian division like general Vlasov's: "Those who have 
betrayed three times (he meant Russia, Turkey and RSFSR — A.M.), will betray for the fourth time as well". 
   February — December developments of 1988 as a result of the whole dashnak politics clearly and 
distinctly reflect the position of present day ringleaders of " the Armenian problem". And how all their 
declarations, addresses and appeals have in common with theses of desperate enemies of the Soviet Power! 
   Close relative of Catholicos Gevork V, the bitterest anti— Sovietist Pirumov wrote in his book "The 
Dashnaktsutyun abroad": 
   "According to the decisions of their highest body — the Xl-th Congress of the party — 
"Dashnaktsutyun" with joint forces is preparing for the events to come, as the only political leader of the nation 
and the only organized force. THE DASHNAKTSUTYUN" IS PREPARING BUT NOT WAITING." 
     "On the way of our struggle the main force with which we have conflict is Soviet Russia. A necessary 
condition of the political, economic and spiritual liberation of Armenian people is OVERTHROW OF THE 
SOVIET POWER IN RUSSIA" (!!!) [132-133] 
     These lines were written more than 50 years ago. And here what is written today by Epigoni of 
"Dashnaktsutyun": 
    "Taking into consideration dangerously explosive character of the moment and feverish efforts of 
Moscow to rouse inter—ethnic clashes, we shall call the Armenians and Azerbaijanians to show their maximum 
restraint, to boycott nationalistic appeals and actions of state patriots and to lay down other initiatives. THEY 
MUST UNDERSTAND THAT THE PRESENCE OF RUSSIA IN THE CAUCASUS IS TEMPORARY BUT 
OUR NEIGHBORHOOD IS FORTUNATELY EVERLASTING. Let us understand that being mutually 
deprived of statehood and independence in foreign policy we can't carry on negotiations at state level for A 
FAIR SOLUTION OF NAKHICHEVAN AND KARABAKH PROBLEM IMPOSED ON US, (just imagine 
how much blood could be shed — A.M.), then while continuing boycott of new Armenian — Azerbaijan 
instigations let's consolidate our neighborly relations. 
    Let's understand that THE ARMENIAN — AZERBAIJAN MUTUAL UNDERSTANDING AT 
PRESENT MEANS SHAMEFUL DEFEAT OF MOSCOW IN THE LARGEST PART OF THE 
TRANSCAUCASUS...". 
(from the appeal of strike center in Erevan). 
   And what is surprising this appeal has been accepted in Erevan and Stepanakert as a fact that stands to 
reason. 
   And as if echoing the leaders of "National self—determination " unity Zory Balayan, a prospering in the 
USSR national—chauvinist over the radio station "The Voice of America" also made them a statement about his 
support. Is it forbidden for Zory Balayan to speak in the USSR? Has he poisoned the masses by his fascist 
publications and at last isn't Zory Balayan the CPSU member? May be he does not know its rules? The play 
begun by dashnaks at the beginning of century is going on. It is a pity that the stake in this dirty play is the fate 
of long—suffering, hard working and talented Armenian nation! In this case, they counted on the indulgence 
and benevolence of authorities, support of the powerful Armenian lobby in Moscow. And today the following 
words of Bolshevik—Leninist Sergei Mironovich Kirov are particularly actual and burning: 
   "The more cruel we shall be towards our enemies, the more cruel we must be in our Communist midst 
in relation to those who try to undermine our unity. And believe me, comrades, that the workers' and peasants' 
Russia [133-134] 
became great Soviet country just because that the communist party directing the whole work is not 
company of the Petrovs and Sidorovs as separate persons but forms an integral unit, the Communist rock to 
which the Central committee gives orders so firmly and surely that not a single military leader has ever 
commanded his armies. LET NOT FRIGHTEN US THOSE WHO SPEAK THAT WE SHALL CHOKE WITH 
NATIONAL HATRED. WE KNOW THAT WE HAVE THE LENIN'S PROGRAM BEFORE WHICH NOT A 
SINGLE DAMMED DASHNAK OR DISGRACED MUSAVATIST WILL DARE TO UNSHEATHE HIS 
SWORD. IN SOME TIME THESE PEOPLE WILL FORGET THEIR OWN NAMES". 
(S.M.Kirov, "The selected articles and speeches.", "Gospolitizdat", 1939, p. 146) 
    Is not too much honour done to rolling in luxury Zory Balayan and Sylvia Kaputikyan having salvoured 
in front of the crowed in Erevan in details of one—hour conservation as if taking place between them and 
General secretary of the CPSU Central Committee M.S.Gorbachev at the beginning of February, 1988. And that 
is not clear at all how they succeeded in talking during three hours with A.M.Yakovlev who also supposedly 
 62
approved the actions undertaken by them. When reading their speeches in front of misinformed crowed of 
million people having gathered near the Opera House in Erevan, you wonder at seeing that there is no difference 
in fact between their speeches in February, 1988 and the theses of dashnaks and gnchak-ists. And if everything 
that they were hysterically speaking to the million crowd was, according to academician G.B.Garibdzanyan, "a 
lesson on democracy and here the mistakes are inescapable" (?!), ("Pravda" newspaper, April, 2, 1988) then 
how this "elite"interprets in their language — anti—Sovietism, strike, the threats to tear the Party — 
membership cards, etc. Or do they and their accomplices think that these overgrown "pranks" will be forgiven 
by history?! They can be really forgiven by the former and contemporary party and state leaders of Armenia, 
such as Arutunyan, Demirchhyan, Voskanyan, Sarkisyan, Mandalyan, etc., but the history has already put them 
in the pillorу of national—chauvinism! Is it possible to listen quietly to this gibberish similar to the Sermons of 
ringleaders in fascist Germany: 
    "WE ARE MASTERS OF THE MEMORY OF ALL OUR LOST PEOPLE. BOTH THE EVENTS OF 
1965 (IN EREVAN A MEMORIAL WAS ES- [134-135] 
TABLISHED TO THE VICTIMS OF "GENOCIDE", THAT SERVED FOR FORCING 
MISANTHROPIC FEELINGS TO THE RISING GENERATION. - A.M.) and present- day events showed that 
people remembering their tragic past grew stronger, became wiser and more solid and have their ideals. But 
people who have their ideals (?!) are immortal, they must not be lost, they must achieve their aims!" 
   Well, the former and contemporary leaders of "the Dashnaktsutyun", "Gnchak" and "National Bureau" 
abroad can be quiet. Their business is in reliable hands in the USSR!!! 
    Just therefore the party remained true to Lenin's instructions, never had any relations with nationalistic 
rubbish and mercilessly unmasked it. The Armenian nationalists, dashnaks, as well as the Azerbaijan 
musavatists and Georgian mensheviks fully displayed their bared teeth in complicated situation of the civil war, 
when they managed to seize power in the region for a short period of time. All of them have left a bloody trace 
in the history of fraternal peoples of the Transcaucasus. 
    Under the cover of national struggle slogans of dashnak government poisoned masses with chauvinism 
and set them» against other people's living in the Transcaucasus. The fratricidal Armenian — Azerbaijan, 
Armenian — Georgian wars provoked by dashnaks and gnchakists had to solve "vexed" territorial questions on 
Akhalkalaki and Borchaly, upper Karabakh and Nakhichevan, on which dashnaks had their eyes. 
    Participant of Baku Commune Arsen Amiryan (don't confuse him with his brother Tatevos 
Amirov,,dashnak, head of band of robbers, a commissar as well — A.M.) as long as in 1918 wrote: 
   "When at the beginning of Imperialist war "the Dashnaktsutyun" party in alliance with murderous 
Nicholas and his vicegerent Vorontsov— Dashkov began their crazy adventure (he means their predatory aims 
similar to the present—day events in NKAR — A.M.) we warned them by such words: "Your policy will bring 
you to the annihilation of the Armenians in Turkey". "Orizon" — the Central organ of "Dashnaktsutyun" 
answered the following: "Let just one Armenian stay in the world but Armenia must be autonomous." 
(Bakinsky rabochy" newspaper. May, 28 (15), 1918)  [135-136]. 
     In fact, according to the evidence of the same Arsen Amiryan: "In Erivan province 200 Moslem (read 
Azerbaijan — A.M.) villages has been destroyed. The inhabitants were left without bread and a roof over their 
heads. 
   Bright light is thrown on the savage character of the modern Armenian extremists acquaintance with 
article "The Armenian problem" volume III of the first edition of Large Soviet Encyclopedia edited by 
O.Yu.Shmidt (1926). It is noteworthy that much later when L.Shaumyan with the help of Anastas Mikoyan 
became the first editor of this Encyclopedia, then this section was "torn out", or to speak frankly, stolen out of 
history. 
    However, earlier N.I.Bukharin, V.V.Kuibyshev, M.N.Pokrovsky, G.I.Krzhizhanovsky and other 
greatest theoreticians and historians of that time wrote: 
   "1. The Armenian Republic of dashnaks has received from their allies (i.e. Antanta) the Kars region, 
some parts of Erivan province taken away from it in 1918 and the population made up to 1.51 million (795 
thousand — the Armenians, 575 thousand - the Moslems (read, Azerbaijanians — A.M.), 140 thousand other 
nations (read, the Russians, Kurds, Jews, Persians, Aisors, Udines, Georgians, etc. - A.M.) 
   Being not satisfied with it dashnaks claimed their rights to the territories of Akhalkalaki and Borchaly 
(parts of Georgia), Karabakh, Nakhichevan region and Southern part of Elisavetpol province (parts of 
Azerbaijan). Their attempts to annex these lands by force (during English occupation of the Transcaucasus) 
brought to the war with Georgia (December, 1918) and long bloody war with Azerbaijan, as a result of which 
the population of these regions was 10—30% decreased and some were razed to the ground. 
...AS OPPOSED TO GEORGIA AND AZERBAIJAN REPUBLIC MAINTAINED FRIENDLY 
RELATIONS WITH DENIKIN'S ARMY TO SUCH AN EXTENT THAT HELPED TO ORGANIZE THE 7—
TH CORPS OF DENIKIN'S ARMY OUT OF ARMENIANS. 
 63
   Dashnaks have committed mass—scale pogrom of the Moslem population of the whole Kars region and 
ERIVAN PROVINCE having turned into ruins districts of Shurugai, Sharuro—Daralagez, Kagyzman, etc." 
[136-137] 
    Notorious Andranik—pasha has shown his worth as the most unruly butcher of the Azerbaijan, 
Georgian and Armenian peoples. The same butcher about whom General Consul of Russia in Erzerum, 
Mayevsky wrote in his memoirs: 
   "At the beginning of winter, 1901 the Armenian band of a certain Andranik appears near Musha ..." 
And here I should like to pay attention to the following. There are some high ranking official who reason 
like that: "Who is Andranik? If you go to Armenia he is praised there, you come to Azerbaijan on the contrary!". 
And it never occurred to some executives from the Central organs of Moscow (for example, comrade Yashin 
from CPSU CC that they need not go anywhere. Well, there are archive documents! It is sufficient to open them 
and to see the historic truth. But what about logic? I insist that this notion is completely allien and unacceptable 
for the Armenian "scholars and scribes". "A fighter for justice", "a national hero", "a standard bearer" of the 
Soviet power, Stepan Shaumyan's close comrade—in—arms having felt that the Soviet power will win a victory 
in the Transcaucasus runs away, runs without turning his head but leaving behind himself the sea of blood. A 
little later he sends his sabre to Armenia, he says he will come as soon as the Soviet power becomes unsteady. If 
the situation is such that by the efforts of some writers having settled down in Moscow in different publishing 
houses great Pushkin is perverted ("Tatsit" poem, 1828), the text—books are published with nationalistic 
"mistakes" and in this case, every time these respected publishers apologized to readers, then it is not surprising 
that Vardges Petrosyan in the magazine "Druzhba narodov" ("Friendship of peoples", No. 1—2, 1968) is again 
touched by thug Andranik and praises "Gnchak" as a progressive foreign party (is not a mockery at the feelings 
of friendship of peoples? ). By the words of his heroes V.Petrosyan adheres to his chauvinistic idea:"There is no 
Urartu and it has never been. Urar-tu. A—ra—rat. It is the same word. It is the same Armenia. Urartu cuneform 
one should read in Armenian. Even it is better in Vaskuran dialect...". 
   Why is V.Petrosyan so careful? Well, because some great scientists and, first of all, our Soviet 
outstanding scientist Boris Piotrovsky in his fundamental works has unmasked this falsificated hypothesis of 
certain Armenian scientists insisting that the Urartu monuments are Armenian! Why? In order to have priority 
in everything and delude young people to win over to [137-138] 
their side new "defenders" of long—suffering nation, for example, academician Andrei Sakharov, his wife 
Alikhanyan—Boner and Galina Starovoitova. 
   "The Gnchak" is known as an Armenian petty—bourgeois nationalistic party and it was founded abroad 
in the 90—s of last century and in words they recognized class struggle of the proletariat and internationalism 
but in fact it represented the interests of nationalistic reactionary circles of Armenians and propagated 
organization of workers according to the national sign. This party concentrated their main attention on the so—
called "Armenian problem" and helped counter—revolutionary "Dashnaktsutyn" (see A.Lalayan, "Historic 
notes", 1937) 
   And here what was written by the well—known Soviet historian A.Myasnikov (Ashot Myasnikyan — 
A.M.) as far as 1925: 
   "At any rate it is not "Gnchak" that started our party (he means the Communist party of Armenia — 
A.M.). "The Gnchak" is the same dashnak but more and earlier shrouded with a false haze of socialism..." 
(A.Myasnikov "The Armenian political parties abroad", "Sovietskii Kavkaz" Publishers, Tiflis, 
1925, p.93) 
   For 2 years of their ruling the dashnak government reduced the population of Armenia from 1, 200 
thousand in 1918 to 774 thousand by 1920, above 300 thousand of Armenians went away abroad. A number of 
Armenians decreased by 22% (184, 5"thousand persons), Azerbaijanians — by 77% (200 thousand persons), 
Kurds — by 98% (20 thousand). A.A.Lalayan reports this in his article "The counter—revolutionary role of "the 
Dashnaktsutyun" party" published in "Historic notes of the USSR Academy of Sciences", (editor—in—chief 
B.D.Grekov, 1938). And that was a natural result, as according to the same A. Myasnikov: 
    "...DASHNAKS HAVE LEFT THEIR OWN BEHESTS TO AN ARMENIAN—OWNER. THEY 
ARE: THE RUFFIAN, MERCENARY, ROBBERY VARZHAPET AND MISANTHROPIC SPIRIT, 
HATRED TO THE TURKS (read Azerbaijanians — A.M.). 
(A. Myasnikov, "The Armenian political parties abroad", "Sovetskii Kavkaz" publishers, Tiflis, 
1925, pages 17—18) 
   In the ocean of people's blood it was drowned an attempt to stop the revolutionary movements of 
peoples and to suppress any efforts to unite with [138-139] 
great Russian nation, a historical friend and brother of Armenian, Georgian and Azerbaijanian peoples. 
Having seen this Lenin's policy in this question is firm and stable, dashnaks were transformed at once (just 
remember their slogan "non—Party" republic — A.M.) and by 1920 changed their orientation when they 
 64
understood that they had nothing in common with Lenin's policy proclaiming internationalism, friendship of 
peoples and their unity. 
   "IF THE ARMENIAN PEOPLE, IT WAS WRITTEN IN DASHNAK NEWSPAPER "AGACH" 
(No.225, November, 1920), -WANTS TO LIVE AND ENSURE THEIR STATE AND LIVING, THEY MUST 
HAVE NOT RUSSIAN BUT TURKISH ORIENTATION". 
   Only assistance of great Russian nation in the person of the XI Red Army has saved peoples of the 
Transcaucasus and, first of all, the Armenian people of final annihilation. Al.Starovsky writes in his book: 
"Thus, the Armenian working people always have been a suffering side, while the Armenian leaders, such as 
Andranik received the generalship from the tsarist government". 
(A.LStarovsky, "The Transcaucasus after October", Gosizdat, 1925, p. 7) 
   The Transcaucasian people — the Georgians, Azerbaijanians, Armenians — always lived in close 
friendship, they united in their struggle against common enemies. History of the Transcaucasian nations is the 
history of their really international friendship and unity. 
   Prominent representatives of literature of three nations often wrote in languages of their neighbours—
brothers. Sometimes they took pen—names, as if stressing by means of them close relationship of three nations. 
   The treasury of their musical culture has been enriched by common efforts. Many outstanding 
performers of their folk music were an equal success on the Azerbaijan stages, in mountainous regions of 
Armenia and valleys of Georgia. 
   Impartial works by M.Lermontov, A.Duyma, V.Vereshzhagin and many other prominent people of 
native and world literature reflected the close friendship between Armenians and Azerbaijanians in Karabakh, 
Shemakha and Shusha [139-140] 
   At present the importance of a contribution of EVERY SOVIET CITIZEN, EVERY NATION AND 
NATIONALITY to the consolidation of social—political and ideal unity of our people is increasing. Nobody 
can have another life, another behaviour or psychology. However, as it is shown by the unprecedented events in 
Erevan, Stepanakert, Askeran, Gadrut, Mardakert and Sumgait we have surely missed the underground activity 
of a certain part of the Armenian intelligentsia who has been preparing the events of February — December, 
1988 for decades. Like their predecessors from "the Dashnaktsutyun" and "Gnchak" these people tried to use the 
new, frank and brave policy of the Communist party to perestroika for their own dirty, dishonest, chauvinistic 
and anti—Soviet aims. 
   The directive bodies of the country arc overwhelmed by the letters confirming the Armenian's 
"uncommonness", their "extraordinary role" in history their "oppressions" by other peoples and, first of all, 
Russians. Is it so? 
   The fact worries me, like many others, that a great part of statesmen of Armenian nationality working in 
the CPSU CC, the USSR Soviet of Ministers, the USSR Procurator's office, MVD and KGB, the USSR 
Ministry of Defence, in editorial offices almost of all Moscow publishing Houses for books, newspaper and 
magazines used their official position, took part in the above events and tried to turn them into nationalistic 
course. Without any shame (why they must be ashamed when they have such a powerful invisible support — 
A.M.) they signed their potentials. Among them there are: Major—General A.A.Arutuynov, Lieutenant-General 
A.A. Vartanyan, academicians T.S.Khachaturov, A.G.Aganbekyan, I.Z. Knynyants, M.Kh.Chalikyan, 
A.S.Sarkisyan, Kh.S.Bagdasarov, I. G.Atabekov, Lieutenant—General A.A.Mikoyan, Major-General A. 
I.Bagramyan, People's artist of the RSFSR Z.A.Dolukhanova, People's artists of the USSR P.G.Lisitsyan and 
G.Gasparyan, Peoples artist of the USSR N.B.Nikogosyan, notorious Sero Khanzadyan, Sylvia Kapulikyan, 
Gevorg Emin, Grant Matevosyan, Bagrat Ulubabyan, Akop Akopyan, Genrikh Mayan, Vardges Petrosyan, Zory 
Balayan and some other people whose heads seemed to go round and who had confused the notions "glasnost" 
(openness) and "democracy" with anarchy, sabotage, diversion and anti—Sovietism. 
   What did they try to achieve? Blood? IT HAS BEEN ALREADY SHED. Historical truth? And again I 
have to refer to some facts. In 1911 well— [140-141] 
known Russian historian N.N.Shavrov published his book "New threat to the Russian business in the 
Transcaucasus: the forthcoming sale of Mugan". To make things clear I shall cite some extracts: 
   "...When the war of 1826—1828 was over, during two years, 1828— 1830, above 40 thousand of 
Persian and 84 thousand of Turkish Armenians were moved to the Transcaucasus on the BEST PUBLIC 
LANDS of the Elisavetpol (ancient Gyandzha) and Erivan province, where the Armenian population was 
sparse, and to Tiflis, Borchali, Akhali and Akhalkhala districts. For settlement they were given 20 thousand of 
dessiatinas of public lands and privatcjands were bought from the Moslems for the sum of 2 million roubles. 
The mountainous part of the Elizavelpol (read Gyandzha — A.M.) provinces and banks of the Gokcha lake 
(now Sevan - A.M.) were settled by these Armenians. It should be mentioned that together with the official 
migrants a great deal of unofficial ones came there, so the total number of migrants was much more than 200 
thousand. 
 65
   After the Crimean campaign some number of Armenians again comes to those places. 1864—1867 
period is characterized by our strenuous activity on the settlement of the Black sea coast by the Armenians and 
Greeks, who had been brought at the public coast from Asia Minor, and by the Letts and Czechs. The new 
settlers were given the best public lands. 
   The Turkish war (1877—1879) with a happy end presented us with a stream of new settlers: about 50 
thousand of Armenians and 40 thousand of Greeks came to Kars region. Besides, GENERAL TER—
GUKASOV (an Armenian) brought to our place, Suramli district, 35 thousand of kibitkas with the Turkish 
Armenians who stayed with us. 
    After this the continuous flow of Armenians from Asia Minor begins, they come with families or 
single. They migrate even in larger number in 1893-1894 during Armenian disorders in Turkey. By the time of 
Prince G.S.Golitsyn's arrival in 1897, who was appointed as a new chief of that district, the newly come 
Armenians numbered not 10 thousand as in 1894 but about 90 thousands. Golitsyn's application for their turning 
out had no effect the Turks did not accept them and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs was not persistent enough 
and thus, these Armenians were declared that if they did not become Russian citizens(?), they would be turned 
out. Certainly, all of them have become Russian citizens and they dissolved among Armenian [141-142] 
population. After that the flow of people from Asia Minor goes on and at present only in the Kars region 
thero-arc about 35 thousand of Armenian families striving for getting public lands to settle down. 
    Besides, some number of Aisors and Moslems came to our places but the largest amount of migrants 
fall to Armenians:so from 1.300.000 Armenians living in the Transcaucasus at present MORE THAN 1 
MILLION DO NOT BELONG TO THE NATIVES AND WERE SETTLED BY US. How many Armenians 
have migrated to our places for 13 last years it is seen from comparison of the following figures: in 1896 
Sheremetyev in his notes counted 900 thousand but in 1908 they were more than 1 million 300 thousand of 
persons of both sexes, i.e. for this time their number grew not less than in 400 thousand. If we take into 
consideration the natural increase, then it appeared that we settled about 300 thousand of Armenians for 13 
years. 
      Unwarranted migration of aliens to the Transcaucasus is expressed in figures in the following: 
Armen
ians 
about 1000000 persons of both 
sexes 
Poles about 17264 persons of both 
sexes 
Czech
s 
about 20014 persons of both 
sexes 
Letts about 4561 persons of both 
sexes 
Molda
vians 
about 272 persons of both 
sexes 
Greeks about 82043 persons of both 
sexes 
Jews about 30890 persons of both 
sexes 
Esties about 5241 persons of both 
sexes 
Aisors about 5028 persons of both 
sexes 
Total  1147922 persons of both 
sexes 
      The Armenians out of landless new settlers have seized extensive public lands"  
(Shavrov N.N., "New threat to the Russian business in the Transcaucasus.the forthcoming sale 
of Mugan to aliens", 1911, pages 59-61) 
 
    Then A.S.Griboyedov in his "Note on migration of Armenians from Persia to our regions" as far as 
1828 wrote: 
   "The Armenians have been settled mainly on lands of Moslem landowners (read Azerbaijanians - A.N.) 
The migrants arc overcrowded themselves and crowed the Moslems who grumble at them. The local 
Regional chief said that he wanted to settle a large number of newly come Armenians on the other side of the 
Araks river but they asked your permission to stay in those places where THEY HAD BEEN GIVEN A PLACE 
TEMPORARILY. And they got your consent." 
   Knowing the habits and character of the Armenian plutocracy concerning the appropriation of lands the 
Azerbaijanians expressed their fear: well the time will come and our lands will be the "Armenian". 
 66
   A.S.Griboyedov wrote as regards this: "Prince Argutinsky and I (general Argutyan , together with 
generals Madatov, Bebutov, Loris-Melikov, Lasarev, Alkhazov, Ter-Gukasov was one of the sponsors or the 
settlment of Armenians in Azerbaijan and Georgia - A.N.) discussed that the Moslems had to be persuaded to 
resign themselves with their present-day burden as it would not be long and not to be afraid that THE 
ARMENIANS FOR EVER WOULD TAKE POSSESSION OF THE LANDS WHERE THEY HAD BEEN 
LET FOR SOME TIME." 
(A.S.Griboyedov, "Pravda" Publishers, Moscow, 1971, pages 339-341) .  
    There would be no harm for Gevorg Bagratovich Garibdzanyan, whom "Pravda" (No.93, April 2, 1988) 
once more has given a chance to speak on its pages on behalf of the Armenian people and Erevan inhabitants, to 
tell the truth, but not to falsify Griboyedov's words and not to concentrate an All - Union reader's attention on 
the fact that he, as an Armenian , took offence of a curfew, that the words about people's friendship had been 
depreciated. Well, whom? Such people as the Garibdzhanyans, Kaputikyans, Balayans, Vazgens having sown 
the wind reap the whirlwind! If to look back, then since the time after the settlement of Armenians on the lands 
of Georgia and Azerbaijan and especially after establishing of the Soviet power in the region these peoples have 
never even mentioned the expulsion of new comers. There was not a hint of their settlement in some book or 
article. 
    The Soviet power put an end to the national hatred having been roused by tsarism and nationalistic 
circles of the Transcaucasian peoples. However, since the early 60 s the Armenian church and "diaspora" with 
its branches in [143-144] 
the USA, France, England, Canada, Lebanon, Syria and other countries became active and under their 
venomous influence just since the 60-s the "fanfares" of ideology of nationalistic Armenian parties "the 
Dashnaktsutyun" and "Gnchak" sounded again in the pages of our Soviet Communist press, to say nothing what 
was taking place abroad. 
   In 1983, 1985, 1986 and 1988 I considered it to be my duty as a Communist to inform the CPSU CC on 
the propaganda of national-chauvinistic ideas by some journalists, writers and historians of Armenia. 
    The publications permeated with nationalistic ideas gave rise to the similar reaction both in Azerbaijan 
and in Georgia being the nutrient medium for ideologically unstable people and separate social groups. 
Apparently the comrades had no time to be engaged in such "trifle" or being afraid of their chiefs did not 
bring this trouble to their notice, as first of all, they bore the responsibility for these and some other blunders 
and serious mistakes in their work. 
   Such instigating publications of some group of "scientists", "men of letters" and journalists of Armenia 
and their home and foreign supporters do a great harm to the subsequent democratization of the society and 
consolidation of Lenin's principle of the USSR people's friendship. 
    It should be frankly said that only attempt to break this friendship to shake one nation's faith in another 
is harmful to the whole of our society. 
   Unfortunately, there were people in Armenia having supreme Party and State power, who did not want 
to understand or did not understand this, they approached a question in one side and created unhealthy attitude 
of mind of some working people. Probably, they have forgotten that only in friendship and on its basis one can 
find solution of all arising problems. 
   Differently it cannot be explained the following fact that when on February 21, 1988 the CPSU Central 
Committee published the resolution on the question of Nqgorny Karabakh, on February 23, 1988 the meeting of 
the most active members of the party organizasion of Armenia in their resolution published really crying 
paragraphs, as if they had not looked through the party document of the country. Thus it ran: 
"3. TO ASK THE CPSU CENTRAL COMMITTEE WHILE PREPARING THE PLENARY SESSION 
ON THE NATIONAL POLICY PROBLEMS TO CONSIDER THOROUGHLY THE QUESTION OF 
NAGORNY KARABAKH TOGETHER WITH OTHER PROBLEMS" [144-145] 
 
    What is this? The political blindness? The party naivety? Besides the di-dactive tone of the paragraph it 
is also surprising the common irresponsibility of the leaders of Armenia's CC. If the members of the Bureau of 
Armenia CP CC and the First Secretary Demirchyan K.S. were so helpless in realization of directives of the 
CPSU CC, then apparently they had to think over in advance the question of conformity to post held by them. 
However as the subsequent events showed, this seeming helplessness was simulated and one-sided, because 
already on February 24, 1988 the State Committee of TV and Radio Broadcasting of the Armenian SSR not 
without consent of the Armenia CP placed TV programm at the disposal of Catholicos Vazgen I, who expressed 
his "special" opinion about this provocative question. That is what he is saying: 
    "I am also greatly depressed (?!) by the settlement of the question of the annexation of Nagorny 
Karabakh to Soviet Armenia. I CONSIDER THIS PROBLEM NATURAL, LAWFUL AND 
CONSTITUTIONAL. I believe that on these days of perestroika and democratization the Soviet government 
will treat this question seriously (?!)." 
 67
   You can suppose that "the holy father" does not read Party documents at all as well as he does not 
apprehend them. But how to explain the fact that already on february 26, 1988 the first secretary of the CP 
Central Committee of Armenia K.S.Demirchyan, after the plenary session of the Central Committee where the 
Secretary of the CPSU CC comrade Dolgikh had announced the text of M.S.Gorbachev, addressed to the 
working people of Azerbaijan and Armenia, appeared in front of the crowd in Teatralnaya Square and made a 
statement that the Plenary Session had made a decision"to ask the CPSU Central Committee of setting up a 
special commission for consideration of the question on Nagorny Karabakh. His words were met with a great 
ovation and rejoicing.And quite naturally the next day the organ of. CP of Armenia, Supreme Soviet and the 
Soviet of Ministers of the Armenian SSR published a number of "responses"of the working people among 
which there was even such phrase -"WE SHOULD LIKE TO BELIEVE THAT THIS LAWFUL REQUEST 
WILL BE PERCEIVED WITH COMPREHENSION." 
("Kommunist" newspaper, No.48, February 27, 1988). 
   And all this after Resolution of the CPSU Central Committee and address of the General Secretary of 
the CPSU Central Committee! I think it is [145-146] 
high time to call things by their proper names. If Armenia's party, press authorities deliberately did not 
want to be efficient and sabotaged carrying into life the decrees of the CPSU Central Committee, this must be 
appraised as - an ANTI-PARTY BEHAVIOUR. Is not Party discipline equally binding for all the CPSU 
members all over the USSR? The consequences of these tricks are known. They are alarming and tragic. Really, 
the people living in Azerbaijan could not look quietly at all this anti sovietism and without indignation to 
receive the first parties of refugees having been beaten and driven away. 
   Murdering of two Azerbaijanians in Askeran on February 22, 1988, uninterrupted strike in Stepanakert, 
provocateur activity of general Arutynov who was busy in frank instigation in Sumgait and then in Stepanakert, 
Mardakert and Gadrut regions on February 28-29, declaring that "our cause is just"and he , among 35 persons of 
the Armenian nationality, living in Moscow, addressed to the CPSU Central Committee with request to settle in 
the positive the question on annexation of Nagorny Karabakh to Armenia and he and 4 persons more were 
received with great comprehension at the CPSU Central Committee. 
    Who is this "Flying Dutchman"? Major-General Arutyunov is the Chief of the courses for civil defence. 
Why hasn't the Central political administration of the USSR Ministry of Defence given the proper appraisal of 
their general's provocateur activity? Isn't it because that some officials took his part, including assistant chief of 
the General Staff at the USSR Ministry of defence Ter-Grigoryants and some others. 
    This impudent provocateur accompanied by two Armenians with sub-machine guns drove around 
villages and with the help of a tape recorder repeated the instigation-extremist speech of Sylvia Kaputikyan and 
Vazgen in Erevan, whereby he provoked the most unruly riots of chooligan criminals, when the innocent 
people, mainly representatives of the working class were murdered. Has only one person from "elite" become a 
victim? No, and it has always been so. For years this enigma will remain on the name of honest, courageous and 
hard-working Armenian and Azerbaijanian peoples! 
    But all this would have never happened if the CP Central Committee of Armenia, some part of 
executives, cultural and art workers of Armenia and Azerbaijan had shown their political maturity and Party 
discipline. [146-147] 
 
    The fact is that in October 1984 the CPSU Central Committee discussed the question "On execution of 
the decree of the Plenary Session (June, 1983) in the Armenian republic Party organization" and passed an 
appropriate Resolution. 
("Pravda", October 21, 1984, No.295/24186) 
    It goes without saying that this Party document was aimed at rendering assistance to the Central 
Committee of the Armenia Communist Party to eliminate large defects in the ideological work having been 
accumulated for years and to put an end to the growth of the nationalistic elements among population, especially 
young people. 
   One would think that the Party organization of Armenia having got complete and long-term program 
will place the work on a broad and deep footing and in the next 10-15 years it will be absorbed in this work. 
Here are some extracts from the resolution: 
   - there are serious shortcomings in the atheistic education of population; 
   -  in some scientific research, works of art it is observed non-class approach when appraising historical 
events and personalities; 
   -  leading Party cadres are poorly attracted for ideological-educational work, many of them have no 
Party-political education; 
   - ideological work has not become yet the business of every Communist; 
    -to increase the responsibility of the first secretaries, branch departments 
 68
of Parly Committees, republican ministries for the political work with people, for ensuring the close unity 
of ideological, organization and economic activity; 
   -  more strictly to make leaders answer for breaking of Party life norms, evasion from personal 
participation in education of the working people. 
I, as a Communist, at that time quite sincerely believed Karen Demirchyan's speech at the Plenum of the 
Armenia's CP Central Committee when he said: 
  "...The resolution also revealed serious shortcomings and neglect in our work, the elimination of which 
requires many efforts of Party organization and all the Communists of the republic for improving of the whole 
matter of the communist education... 
   As you know, the question for discussion at the CPSU Central Committee were prepared for a long time 
and naturally many defects, which had been [147-148] 
revealed, were eliminated in the course of study with the competent assistance of comrades from the 
Commission of the Central Committee." 
   To speak the truth, the fact made me anxious that, according to K.S.Demirchyan, the profound 
shortcomings, mentioned in the Resolution of the CPSU Central Committee, were eliminated too fast and his 
optimistic words made me quiet that "we must achieve improvement of our work, absolute execution of the 
Resolution of the Central Committee". 
("Kommunist" newspaper, January 10, 1985) 
   Unfortunately, the truth and real value of these statements by K.S.Demirchyan were found only during 
events of February-March, 1988 and especially in his pathetic-nationalistic speech on February 26, 1988 in front 
of the crowd, when he gave to understand once more that he would not depart from the taken course and would 
do his best for his nation to be well! (He meant the secession of lands, change of territorial structure of the 
neighbouring republic - Azerbaijan - A.M.). 
   Intoxicated with the support of the crowed of many thousands, K.S.Demirchyan continued in the same 
way. I am sorry, the most honest Communists, members of the Central Committee Bureau and other officials 
did not dare to rebuff him. 
   Meanwhile, when in October 1986 at the Regular Plenary session of Armenia's CP Central Committee 
Demirchyan K.S.reported again on the state of affairs on the ideological front, the Communists heard nothing 
but pompous and idle phraseology (or did not want to hear? - A.M.) It is said that a very simple question has not 
been put at that time but what have they done for realization above mentioned Resolution? By the way, one 
need not ask about that. Everything was clear! Nothing to the point! 
    LENIN'S DEMAND-TO GIVE THEM THE TRIAL OF THE CENTRAL COMMITTEE - should be 
applied in time but not with great delay to such leaders and their followers who had shown their true 
nationalistic-chauvinistic inside. 
   After the XIX-th Аll-Union Party Conference of the USSR Communists where the extremist actions 
were quite clearly estimated, it seems to me that this question must be thoroughly thought over in order to 
discourage everybody from committing such crimes and double-dealing before nation and [148-149] 
 
Party!   Here it should be mentioned again V.I.Lenin's words who warned the Central Committee and 
Party: 
   "To look into the Party struggle you must not take somebody's word but study not only what the parties 
are speaking but what they are doing". 
    We should always remember a catch-word from the Communist Manifesto: "The Communists consider 
it to be contemptible to conceal their aims and convictions." 
   And it is natural that this Lenin's indication was fully reflected in section V of the CPSU Program - 
"Ideological-educational work, education, science and culture", where it is said: "The unity of a word and 
business is AN IMPORTANT PRINCIPLE OF THE WHOLE PARTY AND STATE ACTIVITY - IT IS AN 
INDISPENSABLE DEMAND FOR THE IDEOLOGICAL-EDUCATIONAL WORK". 
    No wonder that only some months after the Resolution of the CPSU Central Committee of Armenia's 
Communist Party in the bookshops and libraries there were again the ideological publications permeated with 
nationalistic poison. Book "By tourist routes of Zangezur" issued in 1985 by "Aiastan" Publishers in circulation 
of 10.000 copies misrepresents the history and present life of this region in the Caucasus Minor, situated not 
only in the Armenian SSR, as it is, stated in the book, but also in Azerbaijan (Zangelan, Kubatli, Lachin, 
Kelbadzhar districts). Stepan Kurticyan in his novel "Fire, I shall tell nothing!" (Literalurnaya Armenia, No. J, 
1986) speaks at the top of his voice of Andranik?! 
   Study of situation in this region shows that the actions of some leaders of the Central Committee of 
Armenia's Communist Party and representatives of Armenia's public continue to differ with their words, that is 
illustrated by ignoring of the CPSU Central Committee Resolutions. You cannot explain differently a new 
appearance and even on greater scale Of "tags" with dash-nak meaning.

   First, the question is about extolling of the Armenian people and making ancient of their history due to 
the diminishing in the part of other fraternal peoples of the Transcaucasus, second, provocative territorial claims 
to the Azerbaijan and Georgian SSR and third, glorifying bloody butcher of the Caucasian nations, Antanta's 
fawner", tsarist general, and then Turkish citizen Andranik-pasha, whom the memorial has been established in 
Goris. 
("Kommunist" newspaper, May, 28 1989, Erevan)[149-150] 
 
  The name of this villianous hireling of counter-revolution, unfortunately, sounds enthusiastically not 
only from the pages of some separate Armenian writer's works but in the Party press as welL 
("Kommunist" newspaper, October 10, 1984, No.235/15314) 
   I wonder what will our ideological enemies think of us if in our press we begin to celebrate such double 
- dyed enemies of revolution as Kornilov, Kolchak, Denikin, Makhno, Kaledin and set monuments to them? 
Then why isn't it nipped in the bud the activity of authors who are extolling Andranik, this general murderer 
who escaped fair revenge by the Caucasian people and had changed his bosses three times (!). 
   Having shown allegiance to tsar Andranik left the tsar' service, served with the Turks, then slipped away 
from them as well. Having taken an occasion of bustle of the civil war in the Transcaucasus he declared himself 
and his robbery detachment to be the Soviet power advocate, fraudulently tried to worm himself into the ranks 
of fighters for it. At first he managed to do this. He could cheat S.Shaumyan, who welcomed him as a national 
hero. 
   In fact, Andranik was a paying agent of Antanta and soon it was clarified. Just at that moment the 
unmasked counter-revolutionary ran away abroad. And quite naturally, it was forbidden to bury him in the 
USSR in 1927, in spite of the numerous attempts of some Armenian circles. 
   The bleeding wounds delivered to the Armenian, Azerbaijan and Georgian working people in an 
underhand way were too fresh. Up to now they shudder with horror when remembering black deeds of this 
"national hero", up to now the witnesses of'his crimes are alive. Till now, to the Armenian public men's regret, 
the crying archive documents "live", which unmask completely this double dyed bandit. 
   For example, here it is the confession of one of the "heroes of the unconquerable" dashnak detachment 
of Andranik: "I have annihilated the Tatar (read Azerbaijan - A.M.) population in Basar-Kechar (it is former 
Azerbaijan region) indiscriminately. The best means against these dogs - to gather all still alive, to fill wells 
with them and from above to press by heavy stones until they die. I have done like that: J have gathered all men 
, women and children and put an end to their life, casting stones at the wells where they had been thrown...". 
(A.Lalayan, "The Revolutionary East", No.2 -3, 1936) [150-151] 
 
    Your are horrified while reading the statement of another "hero" from Andranik's detachment, who 
approved dashnak government having given an order to destroy villages on the north bank of the lake Gokcha 
(Sevan). He wrote: "Thanks to the measures taken by our (read Dashnak - A.M.) government the population of 
these villages (Tokhlidzha, Agbulag, Ardanish) left Armenia borders. They left potato, wheat and rye crops." 
(Newspaper "Zhogovurd"-an organ of the Armenian bourgeoisie, No. 105, 1920) . 
   Such policy resulted in sharp decreasing in areas under grain crops in Armenia. In 1913 it was 345.7 
thousand of ha, but in 1919 - 72.7 thousand of ha. In 1913 in Armenia it was 15.3 thousands of ha under cotton 
crops and in 1919 only 0.6 thousands of ha. (Statistic collection book, Erevan, 1940, p.64) . By dashnak 
government and their fawner Andranik there have been killed true sons of the Communist party, ardent fighters 
for liberation of the Armenian nation, for their happy life - S.Agaverdyan, S.Musaelyan, B.Garibdzhanyan (a 
relative of academician G.Garibdzhanyan - A.N.), O.Sarukhanyan, G.Gukasyan, Yu.Batisyan, B.Sevanyan, 
E.Mkrtumyan, V.Alekseev and many others. There are lots of such examples. 
    Therefore, for a long time no rehabilitation of Andranik could take place. Even in church the name of 
this violator and butcher was under a ban. But after 1960 it begins to be mentioned more often in the sermons of 
priests who try to prove his innocence to clean him of blood and dirt. And little by little they managed to get 
some changes in public consciousness of a certain group of people. It is through church Andranik's 
rehabilitation has come. In the 70 -s, publishing of the book "By the road of struggle" by Anastas Mi-koyan 
(Moscow, 1971, page 42) as if opened the locks through which it came a whole flow of books containing 
attempts to acquit Andranik's evil deeds, to represent him as a supporter of the Soviet power. It is noteworthy 
that those werewolves set the fashion of that dubious campaign, who had been convicted not once of non-class 
approach to the history, to the estimate of historical personalities, namely - S.Khandzadyan, S.Aivazyan, 
B.Ulubabyan, S.Kaputikyan, V.Petrosyan and particularly academician G.Garibdzhanyan, who had been many 
times caught in falsification. 
  The same academician who for 20-25 years by his fabrications had tried the patience of scientists and 
Party leaders, poisoning young people's minds by his deductions.[151-152] 
 
 70
   At last, in the organ of the CPSU Central Committee "Kommunist" magazine (No.8, May, 1983) some 
scientists exposed academician G.Garibdzhanyan's activity, who in his numerous monographs had accentuated 
the exclusiveness of V.I.Lenin's relations with the Armenian Communists and in every possible way without 
any reason overstressed their role, forcing national-chauvinistic ideas. 
   It is noteworthy that periodically the Armenian nation's "elite" brings ever new and new misfortunes on 
the long-suffering Armenian people, for example the events in Erevan, Masis, Razdan and then in Sumgait. 
   Now let's listen to Silva Kaputikyan, a foreign Armenian's daughter, whom the Soviet power offered all 
necessary facilities for her creative activity. She writes: "For many years an outstanding national hero has been 
in oblivion giving cause for our enemies to malignant gossips (I wonder, who are these enemies?!- A. N.). In 
1927 the remains of the hero who died in America were brought to Paris in order to be taken from there to 
Armenia. However it failed for some reason. The French Armenians committed him to the Earth and set the 
memorial." 
(Silva Kaputikyan "The roof of Armenia", 1981, page 5). 
   V. Petrosyan, the former first Secretary of Writers Union of Armenia writers: ...If your grave were on 
the other bank of Araks, the Armenian poets would mourn you. I MYSELF WOULD SPREAD AGAIN 
POPULAR EXPRESSIONS "REPATRIATION OF GRAVES" HAVING COME INTO BEING IN ME IN 
PARIS AT THE GRAVE OF COLONEL ANDRANIK . 
(V. Petrosyan "The Armenian sketches"', Erevan, "Sovetakan Crokh" Publishers, 1984, page 
102). 
   Some other representatives of the Soviet Armenian public have also taken their hands in Andranik's 
rehabilitation. And it is not by chance the encyclopedia "The civil war and war intervention in the USSR" 
("Sovetskaya encyclopedia' Publishers, 1983, p.36) by a collective of authors, including A.S. ABAKUMOV, 
G.G. HZAKYAN, A.O. CHEBARYAN, S.V. KHARMANDARYAN, V.A. AMBARTSUMYAN, runs as 
followers: "Andranik (Ozaryan Andronik) 1865-1927, a participant of the Armenian national liberation 
movement against the Turkish despotism. In 1914 he was the Commander of the first Armenian voluntary 
detachment. In July, 1918 he proclaimed Nakhichevan to be an integral part of Soviet Russia...". [152-153] 
    THESE STATEMENTS LOOK AS A WICKED MOCKERY AT HISTORY ! You see, in the same 
work, page 658, there are data on V.I. Lenin's comrade-in-arms - Georgy Vasilyevich Chicherin, who in 1925 (2 
years before Andranik's death) wrote: "Right now after Brest-Lithuanian peace treaty when the Turkish Army 
began attacking first on Batum, Kars, Ardagan and then farther, general Nazarbekov, Commander of the 
Armenian "national" unit - dashnak, showed resistance to the Turks and after he had retired, THE STRUGGLE 
WAS CONTINUED BY ANTANTA AGENT ANDRANIK. 
  IN THE CAUCASUS HE AIMED AT REACHING URMIYA TO JOIN THERE THE ENGLISH 
DETACHMENT OF DENSTERVILE. But the Turkish troops occupied Urmiya and Tabriz before Denstervile 
and made him retreat. 
("Bakinskiy rabochy" newspaper. May 14, 1925). 
   In these spare lines an exhaustive characteristics of a "national hero" was given. It appears that Georgy 
Vasilyevich Chicherin himself is an enemy of Silva Kaputikyan and the similar "re-animators" of Andranik. 
    Well, the mask has been torn off Andranik, this tsar,s butcher, long ago when the Bolsheviks-Leninists, 
just those, whom V.I. Lenin had addressed once with his well-known warning in the Caucasus, published a 
secret telegram of Andranik himself to the English mission and the USA consulates in the Transcaucasus. Here 
is the text: "As I found myself among traitors and betrayers (are Bolsheviks betrayers?- A.M.) I ask You to 
release me of my duties as a chief of the detachment". 
("Azerbaijan" newspaper, March 5, 1918). 
   Out of fear of revenge this toady together with other leaders of "the Dash-naktsutyn" escaped abroad. 
And let the patriots of "Great Armenia from the sea to the sea" reject the generally known historical facts! 
Thus, falsifying real historical truth some part of contemporary Armenian "historians" and "writers" 
apparently managed to make a hero out of Andranik before present and future generations of Soviet Armenia's 
youth. 
    And again primary sources have to be referred to, which completely reject well thought-out fabrications 
of present -day hidden supporters of dash- [153-154] 
nakists, and gnchakists. It should be done for the sake of memory of hundreds of thousands of innocent 
people murdered by Antanta's hireling and his murmidous. 
. We read in "The historical notes" -"Counter revolutionary" "Dashnaktsutyun" and the Imperialistic war 
of 1914-1918, the USSR Academy of Sciences, 1936: 
   "Above we have written of organization of "voluntary units" by dashnaks and actions of dashnak 
detachment against Turkey, who, according to the political bandits from "the Dashnaktsutyun" had to liberate 
their brothers living in Turkey". If it were really so, of course, the Turkish Armenians would be glad to welcome 
them. But, as it is known, there was nothing of the kind. BOTH WORKING MASSES OF RUSSIAN 
 71
ARMENIANS AND THE TURKISH ONES PROTESTED AGAINST THE SO-CALLED "VOLUNTARY 
MOVEMENT. IN VAN, ERZERUM AND OTHER CITIES OF TURKEY THE ARMENIANS PASSED A 
RESOLUTION AGAINST "VOLUNTARY" CAMPAIGN OF "DASHNAKTSUTYUN" UNDERSTANDING 
THAT "THE VOLUNTARY" DETACHMENTS WOULD HAVE NO EFFECT. THE WORKING 
ARMENIANS OF TURKEY SENT A SPECIAL DELEGATION TO TIFLIS AND ASKED "DASHNAKTSU-
TYUN" AND "THE NATIONAL BUREAU" NOT LET ARMENIANS TAKE PART IN THE WAR 
AGAINST TURKEY AND TO DISBAND "THE VOLUNTARY" DETACHMENTS. But "THE NATIONAL 
BUREAU" and "Dashnaktsutyun" went on with their policy, despite objections of Russian and Turkish 
Armenians. 
   Then A.Lalayan unmasking Andranik's real face writes: 
   "THE VOLUNTARY MOVEMENT IS CHARACTERIZED BY THE FACT THAT DASHNAK'S 
DETACHMENT WITH BLOOD - THIRSTY ANDRANIK-PASHA, AMAZASP AND OTHERS AT THE 
HEAD DISPLAYING THEIR HIGHEST POSSIBLE "COURAGE" IN ANNIHILATION OF TURKISH 
WOMEN AND CHILDREN, OLD AND SICK PEOPLE. The Turkish villages occupied by dashnak's 
detachment were turned into heap of ruins and disfigured victims ... " 
   "The Turkish authorities having seen such actions of dashnak "heros" and knowing the tsar's plan of the 
resolving of the Armenian question, doubled their repressions against Turkish Armenians. They began as if 
compete with dashnak bandits in annihilation of Armenians". [154-155] 
     It is interesting that a group of Armenian "scientists", concealing evil deeds of Andranik and Amazasp, 
indirectly rehabilitate Beriya's and Abakumovs retinue Anastas Mikoyan (father of Sergo Mikoyan - one of 
instigator of events in Erevan and NKAR), who had served Amazasp and, without any doubt, took part in the 
butchery of peoples. By the way, V.Abakumov -the Minister of State Security of the USSR, Apresyan - 
Uzbekistan, Kobuluyan - the Ukrane, as well as Markaryan and Grigoryants - deputy-minister at the Azerbaijan 
Ministry of Internal Affairs have committed their foul deeds against the most honest devoted to the party 
people. All this scum belonging to the Armenian secret party "Dashnaktsutyun" and "Gnchak", fortunately, have 
been shot for mass ungrounded repressions of 1954-1955 according to the sentence of the Military Board of the 
USSR Supreme Court. 
    The contemporary successors of the Abakumovs, Apresyans, Markaryans and Grigoryants in their 
actions on exaggerating of the "Armenian question" proceed from the principles of the imperialistic "historians" 
- POLITICIANS OF ACCOMPLISHED FACT! First a legend is composed and then it is legitimated by various 
publications. In this case they don't disdain any means. But the fact remains, when the historic truth cannot be 
concealed and falsified. 
    Another Armenian writer Mikail Shatiryan has done an ill turn for his fellows when he published 
Stepan Shaumyan's. telegram to Moscow at the height of mass - scale murders and repressions against the 
Azerbaijan people: "Dashnaktsutyun" also had 3 or 4 thousand of national units (read cut-throats. - A.M.) who 
were at our disposal. Their participation in the civil war added to it the national massacre character, but it was 
impossible to avoid it. " WE DID IT DELIBERATELY. The Moslem (read Azerbaijan. -A.M.) poor have been 
their victims" 
("Legend of palm tree", M. Shatiryan, 1974, pages 148-149). 
   So Stepan Shaumyan has unleashed the slaughter of the Azerbaijan people purposely! 
It seems to me that scientists and historians will, have to deal in real earnest with one more "blank" space 
in the history of our nation. 
   In this regard it is also interesting Stepan Shaumyan's testimony at the trial against the murderers of 26 
Baku commissars: "Before leaving the prison I had a conversation with comrade Stepan. He was thoughtful and 
told me I should like to do my last attempt, I don't know what will come out [155-156] 
of it. BUT AFTER THAT WHEN DASHNAKS BECAME CONVINCED THAT THE ENGLISH HAD 
DECEIVED THEM, I WANT TO RAISE A QUESTION ON COLLABOKATION WITH THEM!!! He has 
written a letter and asked me to hand it over to Rostom Zoryan being in Baku at that time (general Arutynov is a 
worth imitator of R.Zoryan who once took an active part in instignation for annihilation of legendary 26 Baku 
commissars. -A.M.) who was not a juridical leader of the Armenian national council but in fact let its policy." 
(A.Bukshpan, "The last days of the Commissars of Baku Commune", Baku, 1928, p.44) 
    S.Shaumyan took every measure to hold his power but other Armenian parties did their best to throw it 
down, though among Baku commissars there were many dashnaks and socialist-revolutionaries . And they 
managed to do this, I shall tell you about it later on. 
    At present let's return to the facts. What did put an end to the terrible bloodshed of the Azerbaijan 
people by dashnaks in February - March, 1918 (70 years ago!)? It is the following! On April, 3, 1918 well-
known revolutionary-Bolshevik, V.I.Lenin's comrade-in arms, Nariman Narimanov, shocked at the scales of 
carnages (in fact, a real genocide of Azerbaijanians by the Armenian National Council. - A.M.) in Azerbaijan 
wrote in his letter to S.Shaumyan and A.Dzhaparidzhe: 
 72
   "Comrades, the Moslems left in the city (read the Azerbaijanians. - A.M.) thought their mistake over 
and with all their heart they recognized the Soviet power and Soviet government. But they arc frightened by that 
the political struggle has been turned into national. This stains and sojls the Soviet power... 
    IF YOU IN THE NEAREST FUTURE DON'T REMOVE THIS STAIN, THE BOLSHEVIK 
THOUGHT AND THE SOVIET POWER WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO HOLD. YOU KNOW THAT THE 
POWER WON BY FORCE OF ARMS WON'T LIVE LONG WITHOUT PEOPLE'S SUPPORT. THUS, YOU 
MUST DO EVERYTHING FOR PEOPLE TO FEEL THAT THE SOVIETS ARE APART FROM "THE 
BLACK FORCES" (read , the Black Hundrcders. - A.M.) WHO' ADDED NATIONAL COLOUR TO THIS 
STRUGGLE. NOT ONLY WORDS ARE NEEDED , IT IS NECESSARY TO SHOW THE WORKERS IN 
REALITY that you are fighting an open war with the "Black Forces". I give you my word that in the city there 
is not any danger for the Soviet power on the Moslem's part. Having recog-  [156-157] 
nized the Soviet power with all their heart, the Moslem's are for peace. The people themselves send their 
representatives with peace appeals. Despite this "the black forces" up to now go on attacking on the Moslems. In 
the nearest couple of days the Soviet government will take in hand these black, brutal forces. 
   I ASK VERY MUCH TO BECOME THOUGHTFUL OVER THE WRITTEN HERE AND TO FIND 
AS SOON AS POSSIBLE THE MEANS TO HEAL THE WOUNDED HEARTS OF MOSLEMS". 
("Gummet" newspaper, April,3, 1918, Baku). 
   In this connection N.Narimanov suggested: 
1. To abolish th Armenian National Committee as a guiding force in the slaughter of the Azerbaijan 
population. 
2.  Either to withdraw or to subordinate the national troops of this committee to the Soviet Government. 
These black forces consisted of 20 battalions (about 5 thousand soldiers) united in 3 brigades under the 
command of notoriousbandits-dashnaks venting their hatred to Turks and Kurds on the poor and defenseless 
Azerbaijan people - they were Amazasp (the former commander of A.I.Mikoyan. - A.M.), Arutuynov and 
officer Beknazarov. 
    Some time later from N.Narimanov's speech the reaction to his letter-warning could be seen. In the 
article:"What is to be done in order the civil war won't get the national colour" we read the following: 
    "...BOTH THE LAST ORDER OF MILITARY COMMISSARS COMRADE Korganov AND THE 
STATEMENT AND THE MEASURES TAKEN BY COMRADE SHAUMYAN HAVE BEEN PERFORMED 
ONLY AFTER THE MOST TERRIBLE AND TRAGIC BLOODSHED IN NEIGHBOURING VILLAGES." 
    As one can't deny there is the sun and one can't help seeing it with open eyers , just so any man free 
from fanaticism will confirm that as a result of the war taking place in the Transcaucasus under the title of civil , 
99% of the dead are people of one nationality (i.e.the Azerbaijanians. - A.M.) 
Erivan province, Lenkoran, Kuba, Shemakha districts will wholly confirm the said by me by their 
appearance. PEASANTS HAVE BEEN KILLED, THERE HAVE BEEN RUINED AND ROBBED EITHER 
PEASANTS OF CERTAIN NATIONALITY OR THE PEACABLE POOR AND WEAK[157-158] 
WHO EVEN DID NOT TAKE PART AT ALL IN THE CIVIL WAR AND WERE NOT AGAINST 
THE SOVIET POWER. 
("Gummat" newspaper, 71, May, 1918). 
    Meanwhile, in spring, 1918 the leaders of Baku, Armenian National-Council doctor Araratnyants , 
general Baratov ct al. to conceal their crimes against the Azerbaijanian nation went in a hurry to Enzeli (South 
Azerbaijan) to see an English general Denstervile, they begged him to come to Baku to prevent marching of the 
revolutionary Red army into the city. Major-general Denstervile accepted an offer willingly. First, to join his 
agent An-dranik, second, to realize long standing predatory aspirations of the English imperialism in the 
Transcaucasus. 
(Major-general Denstervile, "The British imperialism in Baku and Persia, 1917-1918", Memoirs, 1925, 
pages 9, 189) 
   It is known that the Musavatists also shed the blood of Armenians on the Azerbaijan land. But the 
names of the organizers of their foul actions have been mentioned neither at school nor in a single publication, 
but Andranik's name, as a national hero, is rammed into minds and hearts of children of under-school and school 
age. Sergei Mironovich Kirov was right, when he said: 
   "The most valuable, the dearest and nearest for every Bolshevik is Leninist education of our party's 
members. 
   Let's take such sphere as literature. Literature is already an appreciable and considerable part of our 
present day life, now it gets quite definite influence on the large masses of working people of our country. CAN 
A CONSCIOUS COMMUNIST GO BY THIS SPHERE? OF COURSE, HE CANNOT, HE MUST VERY 
ATTENTIVELY COME TO KNOW THE PARTICULARS".     ' 
(S.M.Kirov, "Selected articles and speeches", 1939, p.85) 
 73
    A direct consequence of such connivance is disrespect particularly of young people to the Azerbaijan 
and Georgian nations, widespread secret sale of Andranik's pictures, Vazgen's appeals, programs of non-formal 
committees and other anti-Soviet works, including collection books "Armenia is going on" published by the 
church Commissions on the International problems, where the demands have been made: SECCESSION OF 
THE ARMENIAN  SSR  FROM  THE  SOVIET  UNION  AND  MAKING  "GREAT [158-159] 
ARMENIA" FROM THE MEDITERRANEAN TO THE BLACK SEA AND CASPIAN SEAS. I 
remember the natural ending of wild leaders who suggested the ideas of making "Great Germany ", "Great 
Israel" and much earlier - "Great Arabic Caliphate", etc. Is it surprising that as a result of all this the events in 
Azerbaijan and Armenia began to take place? The proverb says: "The echo responds to the call". Nowadays it is 
clear throughout the USSR that the actions are led not by the switchmen like Airikyan or Grigoryants, but 
experienced controllers, who have been told about a lot. I am filled with indignation at the fact that many ideas 
suggested by the chauvinists abroad, are being propagated in the Soviet Union as well. Z.Balayan, S.Aivazyan, 
I.Muradyan, S.Kaputikyan, S.Khanzhadyan make their active contribution into it . And not only in legal 
published books but in secretly spread home-made editions being sold in the markets of Erevan, Echmiadzin, 
Stepanakert, Gadryt, Martuni and Mardakert. 
    Besides, unfortunately, according to demands of some Armenian leaders a part of lands in Kazakh 
region and other places has been transferred to the Armenian SSR. That place was not fenced off by barbed 
wire, because we have one Motherland - the USSR! 
    The transferring of a plot of 1599 ha. ("Moscow news", No. 16, April, 17, 1988, p. 13) was considered 
by various strata first of all, by the church, as a great victory. The church intrusively displays itself to be nearly 
the only supporter of the Armenian nation. For example, it informs publicly (any passer -by will tell you about 
it) that using their money the Sport Palace "Razdan" in Erevan was reconstructed after fire, that struggle for 
Karabakh has not been finished yet, it is getting some new large-scale character and , at last, that the Union 
government will not bear it and yield them. 
    Under these conditions, naturally a question arises: for what is all this being done by the leaders, 
Communists, what are these demonstrative territorial claims? The true aim is quite evident - to provoke 
displeasure and hostility between inhabitants of two fraternal republics, to show frankly to their foreign fellows 
a fighting spirit of nationalism and chauvinism. Hasn't it caused the impudent behaviour of people's deputies 
Igityan and Gdlyan who were on firm ground of impunity, we don't care they say. And when the troops were 
brought into Erevan some double-dyed ring-leaders of the committed provocation, completely unmasked by 
their actions - they took offence. We have been slapped in the face, they say. Well, who asked for this  [159-
160] 
"slap in the face" ? Nowadays high ranking instigators of this provocation have crept into their luxurious 
flats in Moscow, Erevan, Baku, Stepanakert and kept quiet, I think until a certain time. There is no doubt that if 
they are not punished, then the events of February - March, 1988 will be repeated! By all means, as the impunity 
gives full scope. This can be judged by Z.Balayan's books "Home" published by "Sovctakan Grokh" in 1984 
and "Bread" - by IJSovietsky pisatel" and his subsequent provocative publications in the pages of periodicals. 
   Carrying on the reactionary program of "Dashnaktsutyun" in a new, modernized form prompted by 
church, the author "suffering for the lands" of ancient Armenia calls frankly for intervention (!) and only in it he 
sees a pledge of happy future (?) for the Armenian nation. 
    "AT THE SUNSET WE AGAIN CLIMBED UP THE EGVARD HILL: AT LAST EVENING LIGHT 
ARARAT WAS SEEN WELL... NODAIR AlVAZYAN BROKE THE SILENCE. ONE THING I KNOW 
FIRM: BY NO WORDS WE CAN BRING NEARER ARARAT OR IGDIR, ONLY BY ACTIONS..." 
("Home" by Zory Balayan, 1984, pages 414-415) 
    Well, real freedom won by the freedom loving Armenian people thanks to the fraternal and 
disinterested aid of great Russian people, other peoples of our country is not happiness for Balayan and his 
"heroes". Their genuine happiness Balayan and his company see in revival of spirit of "Dashnaklsu-tyun,land 
"Gnchak", in open actions, pressure upon government bodies and strikes. 
   Aren't there in Armenia, in party historical science, literature, criticizm such forces which able to snub 
Z. Balayan and his supporters? Who allows historians, writers and journalists to propagate the nationalistic 
gibberish? What powers are behind their backs? How can thev decline the responsibility? 
Partly this powers have been disordered! But only party! But what can the Azerbaijanians do if such 
friend of T.Gdlyan like V.Korotich has turned the pages of his "Ogonyok" into a branch of "Dashnaktsutyun" 
organ. Can the Azerbaijanians resist unexpected attacks of "Pravda", "Komsomolskaya Pravda", Izvcstiya", 
"Krasnaya Zvezda", "Sclskaya Zhizn", "Gudok", etc. And it is done in obtrusive, delicate way - you cannot find 
faults with them! [160-161] 
G.Borovik's pupil, R.V.Shcheglov, the editor of "Meditsinskaya gazeta" demonstrates a specimen of such 
delicate things: there is a photo by I.Vaulina in this newspaper, page 4, July 11, 1989. We are reading the text: 
 74
"Song and dance company Rukh" (that is" cheerfulness" in translation from Georgian) of Mingechaur city 
department of health. In the foreground (in the center) it is the leader of the dance group S.D.Abdullayeva. 
   "First, Mingechaur is in Azerbaijan, second "Rukh", "cheerfulness" in Azerbaijan, third , why is such 
jumble? I think the worst is in future, when the Lithuanians will be confused with Letts, Uzbeks with Tajiks, 
Nanaians with Gagauzy, Chechens with Lezghines, etc. (Who will make them out, they say). 
   Well, it is again trifles. 
    An unpunished group of scientists and ideological workers of Armenia deals with total corruption of 
young people - the future of Soviet Armenia. And at what aims the young people and intelligentsia the article by 
Sero Khanzadyan "To what do stone books testify?" published in "Avangard" (January 5, 1986), organ of the 
Central Committee of Young Communist League of Armenia. Instead of attracting young people's attention to 
the soonest resolving of present-day economic and social problems, the author calls for inventory of history, for 
"crusade" against the fraternal people. 
   Here is only one extract from his work: "I give you an advice to follow his example and also to create 
such works in the ARMENIAN HISTORICAL PLACES - KELBADJARY, SHEKI, LACHIN, KUBATLY..." 
The comments are quite extra. Really, everybody knows that these territories are an inseparable part of 
Azerbaijan! That is the result - first, there are claims in paper, then they are quite concrete, the appetite comes 
with eating. The consequence of all previous intrigues, naturally, became "nation-wide" struggle for the lands of 
Nagorny Karabakh. 
   Or there is another fact. We have already said about an improper role in "Karabakh problem" of some 
officials who having no control do a bad turn to the leaders of the country even in presenting exact statistic data. 
    At the Congress of People's deputes of the USSR on June 1, right after the day time sitting of the 
Congress, M.S.Gorbachev met the delegation of Estonia. Speaking with deputes of thorough economic 
interrelations M.S.Gorbachev said:  [161-162] 
   "You must take into consideration that wc arc interconnected to the extent we haven't even suspected. 
When in Stepanakert with 250 thousand of population the clcctrotcchnical enterprises ceased to supply with 
their production, it was fell at once." 
(" Sovetskaya Estoniya" newspaper, No. 129, June 3, 1989). 
   For what and who needs such arbitrary treatment of data?! Even in the whole of NKAR there is no this 
quantity population! The aim is long-distant. First, to make an impressions on readers that a great number of 
Armenians live in NKAR and more over in Stepanakert (though in the whole region there arc about 110 
thousand of them - A.M.), second, M.S.Gorbachev will not check up his assistant. Thus, in the Baltic republic 
wc learned the data on NKAR inhabitants. In this connection the figures arc interesting given by A.I.Volsky - 
the chairman of the Committee for Special Management in the interview to the "New Time" magazine, where 
he, perhaps, resting on reliable data made a statement: 
    "It is true, we haven't made a tragedy out of strike - 186 thousand live in the region, 9 thousand went on 
strike...". 
("NewTiте" magazine N39, 1989, p.36). 
   It puzzles the careless and unprincipled position of the USSR Slate Press Committee and Young 
Komsomol League Central Committee that must carry on the merciless struggle with any kind of nationalistic 
statements and prejudices of bourgeois sense and parlicularly in the pages of newspapers for youths. 
   In the text-book "History of the Armenian nation" for the 7-8 forms, issued by "Luis" Publishers in 
1985, page 187, a collective of authors writes plainly thai "ALL GREAT POWERS WITHOUT EXCEPTION 
HAVE USED THE ARMENIAN PROBLEM IN THEIR COLONIAL AIMS. THE IDEAS OF FREEDOM 
AND INDEPENDENCE WERE ALIEN TO THEM AND HAD NO IMPORTANCE FOR THEM". 
   How is that? It means that everything we studied, everything we knew aboul Russia, Russia as a 
liberator, as a center of revolution, and, at last about Russia having given to the world the Dcccmbcrists and 
great Lenin, is crossed out with a stroke of a pen. And where docs it take place? In the USSR!! It can be only 
supposed that the teachers at the lessons tell children their own concoction, if such things arc written in text-
book! [162-163] 
    It is beneath criticism "History of the Armenian nation" issued by the same publishers for the 9-10 
forms, then some articles from the Armenian Soviet Encyclopedia, the book by SH.MKRTYCHYAN "History 
of architectural monuments of Karabakh", issued by "Aiastan" Publishers in Armenian, other works, published 
after Resolution of the CPSU Central Committee (1984) "On the course of June (1983) Plenary Session of the 
CPSU CC in the Armenian republican party organization". 
   Well, the leaders like to speak of their adherence to the Russian people. It turns out that this Pharisaism 
is needed to cover their tricks, intrigues and anti-Soviet propaganda. At last they have not stood and betrayed 
themselves! And all this found its psychological reflection in organization of disorders and disturbances. And if 
everything that the contemporary patriots of "Great Armenia" compose for the joy of imperialistic propaganda is 
true, then, perhaps, such prominent and well-known, true representatives of the Armenian literature, as 
 75
A.Akopyan, D.Demirchyan, O.Tumanyan, G.Sundukyan, Al. Shirvanzadc and many others at their time had 
more reasons to write about it! Yet, they devoted all their life to the description of the feats of labour of the 
Armenian people, their struggle against enemies of socialism, glorifying the real greatness of the Armenian 
nation! Then why have their successors, a group of modern "writers" and historians let themselves goto such 
extent? 
    If to follow a certain group of Armenia's scientists and writers, then the Russian people have every 
reason to hate fiercely the Tatars and Mongols, Poles, Germans, Swedes. For more than 300 years they tortured 
Russia doing their best to wipe off the earth. But today, the Soviet Union and, first of all, Russia lends a helping 
hand to Germany, Poland and Mongolia, creates all economic conditions for real flourishing of Soviet Talaria 
and Bashkiria. And it makes us happy. It is in accordance with Lenin's behests! It would be a good thing now to 
remind again the leader's words, who taught to be delicate in establishing relations between people of different 
nationalities, called not to admit insults of their national feelings, even if due to carelessness, even if in jest. 
("Complete works", V.l.Lenin, ed.5, v.45, p.360) 
    In his famous work "On the question of nationalities or "autonomatization" he answered: [163-164] 
    "Who did not understand this, he did not comprehend really proletariat relation to the national problem, 
in fact, he remained with his petty-bourgeois point of view and can't help coming every minute to the bourgeois 
point of view". 
    "THE UNION OF SOVIET SOCIALIST REPUBLICS SHOULD BE REMAINED AND 
CONSOLIDATED. THERE CAN BE NO DOUBT ABOUT THIS MEASURE, WE NEED IT, AS WELL AS 
THE WORLD COMMUNIST PROLETARIAT FOR STRUGGLE WITH THE WORLD BOURGEOISIE 
AND FOR DEFENCE FROM THEIR INTRIGUES" 
("Complete works", V.I.enin, v.45, p.360). 
   However, we must take into consideration that the results of secret and open provocative activity of 
separate Armenian "scientists" and "writers" are displayed in the national conceit and narrow - mindness , in the 
ethnic prejudices, playing in the hand of imperialistic centers who try to undermine the friendship and 
cooperation of the peoples in the Soviet Union. Seeing and feeling that material and mainly moral damage 
brought by the events in NKAR and in its districts. I think once more over the question that if the CPSU Central 
Committee and the Soviet government had not made any efforts to prevent these extremist criminal actions, then 
to what disaster would have been pushed the peoples by this influential and imposing group of the direct and 
indirect enemies of revolution mentioned above? 
   How can one understand the anti-Soviet riots in Stepanakert, begun on April 24 1988, ever-lasting 
strikes during 1988-1989 and will the leaders of Party organization in NKAR including former be severely 
punished? How can one comprehend that as a result of extremist instigation in Stepanakert the Azerbaijanians 
are driven away from their working places and in Armenia the Azerbaijanians are frankly slighted for decades. 
Will not it bring to response? 
   Well, though it is bitter to comprehend but all this rubbish must be burnt out of our Soviet society by the 
red-hot iron. 
    At present, after the XXVII Congress of the CPSU and the XIX All-Union party conference, the 
Communists, the Central Committee not by words of mouth but in practice realize this and some other Lenin's 
directions in life. I think it is necessary to teach an illustrative lesson to the group of presumptuous national-
chauvinists who had shown thefr real face even at the 1-st Congress of the USSR people's deputies. [164-165] 
   I should like to be sure that some Moscow and other publishers, passing to their pages the nationalistic 
fabrications due to their lack of knowledge of true history of the Transcaucasus, at last will take all measures for 
suppression of such publications. 
   By the way, all readers were puzzled by the fact that "Izvestia" newspaper had published an instigating 
statement by Z.Balayan but in some'days again in its pages he naively assured an Ail-Union reader that he had 
been misunderstood. To my mind, "Izvestia" is not the organ where you can speak whatever you want and then 
to be hypocritical. 
    I hope that both the Armenia's CP Central Committee and the appropriate republic organizations will 
regard with responsibility all the questions above and once and for ever put an end to the non-class approach to 
the appraisal of history and, in particular, activity of such violent counter-revolutionary messenger as it was 
Andranik. 
   I should like to believe that Armenia's CP Central Committee, though with great delay, but still will 
place the work on a broad footing for realization of the CPSU Central Committee resolutions on a large scale. It 
is just required for the republic party organization. 
    If the former correspondent of "Pravda" Yu.Arakelyan for his mercenary or other motives tries to cast a 
slur upon his newspaper denying his signature under the article, it is one confirmation more of rejection class 
positions in hand of national-chauvinists. This trick of Communist Yu.Arakelov, talented, but, as it turned out, 
 76
double-faced correspondent, whose articles I had read with pleasure and interest roused the indignation among 
all strata of population. 
    It should be mentioned here the article by Karen Khachaturov, published in "Moscow News" on March, 
20, 1988 "Fruits of complacency and inaction". 
   If to call the things by their proper names, this article was one attempt more to call the extremists and 
strike organizers for continuation of anti-Soviet reprising. 
While reading publication by A.Vartanyan and G.Danielyan ("Communist", No.83, April, 7, 1988) entitled 
"Under the cover of a patriot", you won- [165-166] 
der clumsy efforts of the authors to distract reader's attention from instigators-provocateurs. The 
Airikyans and Grigoryants are notorious rascals, they can be sacrificed. But who could in Armenia unmask 
S.Kaputikyan, Z.Balayan, S.Aivazyan, S.Khanzadyan, V.Ulubanyan, V.Petrosyan, M.Shatiryan, 
A.Arzumanyan? Nobody, as behind their backs there was the First Secretary of Armenia's CP CC 
K.Demirchyan, a powerful Moscow "lobby", Vazgen I with a large network of foreign millionaires, churches 
and Committees. No doubt, that all this thoroughly prepared and successfully carried on anti-Soviet and anti-
Azerbaijan action was taking place under competent guidance of foreign emissaries of notorious Committee 
ASALA (Secret Armenian Army for liberation of Armenia). For the first time it showed itself on January, 1, 
1975 in Beirut, where it committed an armed attack on some places. It is a branch of "The International 
Revolutionary Movement". It is ASALA that screams of Armenian's oppression in the Soviet Union (?!), on 
necessary secession from the Soviet Union, first having snapped off in the USSR the territories of Nagorny 
Karabakh, Nakhichevan, Akhalkalaki and Borchaly. To this infamous organization echo not less infamous 
"Vindictive commandos of the Armenian genocide" and at last" New Armenian resistance" (NAR) organization. 
All of them are a gutta-percha toy in the hands of the double-dyed international reaction and CIA. It should be 
noted that February - March "explosive events" in the history have not chance but quite natural character. Here 
are the facts: 
   February - March, 1905 - provocative actions of dashnaks and gnchakists resulted in murderous clashes 
between Armenians and Azerbaijanians; 
   February - March, 1918 - undisguised genocide of the Azerbaijanians provoked by the Armenian 
National Council (read letters by N.Narimanov to S.Shaumyan, 1918) 
   February - March, 1921 (after establishing of the Soviet power in Armenia) - uprisal of "the Armenian 
fighting organization" against the Soviet power headed by inveterate national-chauvinist S.Vardunyan, who 
during 40 days murdered Communists-Bolsheviks in Erivan and its neighborhood (read "The Armenian political 
parties abroad" by A.Myasnikov, "Sovetskii Kavkaz" Publishers, Tiflis, 1925, p. 50). 
    And at last, February - March, 1988 (read speeches of Vazgen I, Sylvia Kaputikyan, every kinds of 
appeals of "the centers" and in signating actions of some part of Armenian elite"). [166-167] 
   Probably, it should be expected a compulsory, repealed provocation on the part of a group of Armenian 
public, who were already known, but remained unpunished. PERHAPS, THIS TIME A POWERFUL 
FASHION WILL BE GIVEN BY THE CHURCH WITH VAZGEN I AT THE HEAD. Acting according to the 
principle "by hook or by crook" they will instigate people to be given at their uncontrolled disposal the 
monuments of Albanian architecture for organization of monasteries and educational institutions there. I think 
that Vazgen I will arouse the question on the pride of the Azerbaijan architecture, famous Gandasar monastery 
in Nagorny Karabakh built by old Azerbaijan architect Gasan Jalal. 
   Misinformed readers and the USSR broad public, of course, much later learn that everything was begun 
with the murdering of two Azerbaijan fellows in the Armenian village Askeran that among murderers in 
Sumgait there was a certain Grigoryan whose hands were stained with blood, including some persons of 
Armenian nation. Stepanakert inhabitant, double-dyed murderer Grigoryan and his band being undqr the 
influence of narcotics personally tore to pieces 16 Armenians. Unfortunately, only Grigoryan was caught, the 
rest escaped without any trace. Having been bribed by Gdlyan and Karakozov with "Uzbek money" above 60 
criminals of Armenian nationality from Stepanakert, Erevan committed their evil deeds in Sumgait, they spoke 
perfect Azerbaijan and were able to use arms skilfully. 
   It is not by chance the General Secretary of the CPSU Central Committee M.S.Gorbachev at the special 
meeting of the Supreme Soviet Presidium on July 18 in reply to V.Petrosyan's foul trick concerning "genocide" 
in Sumgait invented by him said: "But, look here, they were dregs of society, criminals, why do you impute 
everything to the Azerbaijan nation?" 
   In all the times of history one principle is well known: "Stop thief! ", typical of provocateurs and 
falsificators of history.-Now a group of Armenian compilators is yelling about the political appraisal of Sumgait 
in order to compromise the Azerbaijan nation. Many people never thought of it. But the solution was quite 
simple. 
 77
   Just they need a reason to scream all over the world about great victims and oppressions of Armenians. 
They are certainly infuriated and upset by the quiet, thought-out, thoroughly Communist and international 
position of the Azerbaijan Communist Party and Azerbaijan people. They wanted to [167-168] 
provoke bloodsheding, but the destiny of the long-suffering Armenian people is not interesting for them at 
all. Otherwise, how shall we explain the fact that since March - May, 1989 it has been taking place the general 
banishment already of the so-called "Baku Armenians? 
    Many young generations will study the text-book "State and law", where under one of the pictures of 
lessons at school it is written "Stepanakert, the Armenian SSR". IT IS TRUE, "PROSVESHCHENIE" 
PUBLISHERS HAVE APOLOGIZED TO READERS BUT WHO NEEDED IT, IF THE TEXTBOOK 
REMAINED WITH "MISTAKE". The Azerbaijan peoples for ever have linked their destiny with the destiny of 
the USSR peoples and, first of all, Russian people. Unlike some group of Armenian scientists, in Azerbaijan for 
years of the Soviet power, it has never been a directive for seccession from the USSR for making of "Great 
Azerbaijan" Meanwhile, about 20 million of Azerbaijanians live over the Southern frontiers of Azerbaijan. And 
though in 1946 the circumstances were favorable for reunification and making single Azerbaijan, adventures 
L.Beriya, V.Abakumov and A.Mikoyan, who were terribly afraid of united Azerbaijan, could persuade I.Stalin 
to resist this kind desire of people. The Georgian people also have something to tell about. But in Georgia and 
beyond it there are no such "patriots" of the Promised Land and have never been. 
    The events on reanimation of "dead body" rotten through entitled "Armenian problem" arouse certain 
feelings of Azerbaijan and Georgian youth. Who needs that? The enemies of revolution, the enemies of 
perestroika and of the Soviet Union need that. How prophetic are the words of well-known Armenian publicist 
P.Makiyants, who wrote as far as 1926: 
   The world plunderers (first of all, he means England, France and the USA - A.M.) have already 
exhausted the Armenian problem. The only one thing is left-to bury it once and for ever. BUT FAR-SEEING 
DIPLOMATS OF EUROPE AND AMERICA DID NOT WANT TO DO THAT. THEY LEFT THE 
EMBALMED "DEAD BODY" OF THE ARMENIAN PROBLEM IN THE LEAGUE OF NATIONS, MAY 
BE THE RELICS WILL BE OF USE". 
("The Armenian problem on theLosanna conference", Tiflis, 1926, p.6) 
   The imperialists knew what they were doing: the relics have proved useful! And on what shameful 
scales!  [168-169] 
    It is not surprising that academician V.A.Ambartsumyan, to say it mildly, deliberately deluded the 
people's deputies at the I congress in June, 1989, when made a statement that "the Europarliament recognized 
the genocide of 1915". 
   His words were aimed at the uninformed, who could not know that the Europarliament had rejected this 
fabricated fact, as well as earlier they failed to force this question through the famous Losanna conference of the 
European countries .and the USA. But B.Ambartsumyan managed to lay the foundation for a new building of lie 
and falsification. 
  Another representative of Armenia told the deputies an impudent lie that the memorial had been erected 
to 70 Azerbaijanians who were in a hurry to help earthquake-striken people and were lo'st near Erevan under 
mysterious circumstances. However sad it is, but I remember Gebbels's words that "the more monstrous a lie, 
the more it is truthful". 
   We, the Soviet people, must never, under no conditions, forget that our true happiness and well-being 
we got with Great October, in real, ever-lasting friendship with Russian and other peoples of the country. And it 
is not bare words. It is a trial of the Truth by time and life! And it is once more has been demonstrated by 
international Baku when the Russians, Azerbaijanians, Armenians, Georgians and people of other nationalities 
all day round were on duty in the streets and squares of the city and villages in order to suppress any 
provocation. On these disturbed, to tell frankly, terrible days, Baku inhabitants met with the leaders of the city 
and republic every day. Everywhere people told their leaders: "WE SHALL UPHOLD PERESTROIKA AT 
THE COST OF OUR LIFE! ", "REVOLUTION IS OUR VITAL CONCERN", "INFORM MOSCOW THAT 
EXTREMISM WON'T WORK!". It was a real demonstration of Lenin; national policy in practice! 
   And the last. The above mentioned representatives of the Armenian nation using misinformation of 
broad public could arouse pity for themselves by historical injustice with respect to the fact that the problem of 
Nagorny Karabakh and Nakhichevan territories had been solved in favor of "Great Armenia", then it was 
changed. Well, here it shouffl be revealed THE TRUTH, ALAS, HIDDEN under multilayer lie. 
   When good news of establishing the Soviet power in Armenia reached the working people of 
Azerbaijan, on December 1,   1920 the grand meeting of  [169-170] 
Baku Soviet took place , where chief of the Azerbaijan government Nariman Narimanov announced a 
resolution, which, in particular, ran as follows;"...Soviet Azerbaijan, meeting half-way the struggle of the 
fraternal Armenian working people against power of dashnaks, shedding the blood of our best comrades - 
Communists within Armenia and Zangezur, declares that henceforth no territorial problems can be the reason of 
 78
mutual bloodshed of two neighboring pcoplcs;thc Armenians and Azerbaijanians, the territories of Zangezur 
and Nakhichevan districts arc an inseparable part of Soviet Armenia but the right of self-determination is given 
to the working peasants of Nagorny Karabakh ... 
   "Besides, Soviet Azerbaijan widely opened before Soviet Armenia the ways to innumerable riches of 
Azerbaijan oil, kerosene and other products. These riches which had been extracted by plunderers of the world 
imperialism and for the sake of which there were murderous orgies on the Transcaucasus land, since present day 
become the property of the working people of Russia, Soviet Azerbaijan and Soviet Armenia who uniting in 
close ranks will go for the complete defeat of the world capitalist yoke." 
("Communist" newspaper, No. 176, December 2, 1920) 
  Such was fraternal, hearty act and specific step of the Azerbaijan government and people in December, 
1920 to prevent national clashes in future. What has happened later on. The following: the Soviet power, 
friendly relations with fraternal Russian, Azerbaijan and Georgian peoples did not suit the Armenian people's 
"elite" and only in 1 - 1.5 months in Armenia anti-Soviet riot was committed with the aim of sccccssions from 
the Soviet Union together with Nagorny Karabakh, Zangezur and Nakhichevan. 
   In this case, head of the national government Simon Vratsyan developed such misanthropic policy that 
even Hitler's thugs would be pale by their side. Within February - April, 1921 in Armenia an open slaughter of 
Communists - Georgians and Azerbaijanians took place. The defenseless population of Nakhichevan and 
Nagorny Karabakh (i.e. Khankendy - now Stepanakert - A.N.) in tens of thousands were murdered by butchers 
who were carrying the line of liberation of Armenia from aliens. According to S.Ordzhonikidze: "Since 1906 
the blood of these unhappy peoples is being shed. People are annihilated by thousands without any mercy. I was 
myself a witness, how miserable little children who had done no harm to anybody [170-171] 
were being thrown into gulf and defenseless women into wells to die there in awful sufferings.". 
( S.K.Ordzhonikidze, "Articles and speeches" V.I, Moscow, 1956, pages 139-141). 
   IN APRIL 1921 THE RED ARMY SUPPRESSED THE MURDEROUS ACTIONS OF 
S.VRATSYAN'S GOVERNMENT WHO COULD ESCAPE REVOLUTIONARY TRIAL OF THE 
TRANSCAUCASIAN PEOPLES AND FOUND HIS SHELTER ABROAD LIKE HIS CLOSEST FOLLOW-
FIGHTER ANDRANIK-PASHA. 
   But it would be naive to think that the question has been exhausted. The seeds of hatred and hostility 
sown by these bandits could give rich harvest. And in order to nip the fratricidal clashes, on V.I.Lenin's 
instruction, on July 5, 1921, the Plenary session of the Caucasian Bureau of the Central Committee of the 
Russian Communist party (of Bolsheviks), where comrades Ordzhonikidze, Nazartyan, Myasnikyan, Kirov, 
Makharadze, Orekhalashvili, Figatner, Narimanov were present, the following resolution was passed: 
   "PROCEEDING FROM THE NECESSITY OF NATIONAL PEACE BETWEEN THE MOSLEMS 
(read, Azerbaijanians. - A.N.) and ARMENIANS AND ECONOMIC RELATION OF UPPER AND LOWER 
KARABAKH ITS CONSTANT CONTACTS WITH AZERBAIJAN, TO LEAVE NAGORNY KARABAKH 
WITHIN AZERBAIJAN SSR, HAVING PROVIDED FOR IT THE REGIONAL AUTONOMY WITH 
ADMINISTRATIVE CENTER IN SHUSHA CITY BEING A PART OF THE AUTONOMOUS REGION. 
   As seen from the historical facts cited above, the extremist national-chauvinistic acts of the Armenian 
people's leaders failed again. But at the same time comparing them with the developments of February - 
December, 1988 in Nagorny Karabakh I feel hurt that the seeds sown in the past from time to time sprout and 
these shoots must be again destroyed for the sake of further consolidation of the USSR people's fraternity. 
   By the way, here are some words about the name - Nagorny Karabakh! First it was invented by generals 
of tsarist army Argutyan (Argutinsky), Lazarcv, ct. al, then was used by S.Shaumyan, L.Mirzoyan and 
A.Mikoyan and later by I.Stalin. I wonder, why have not been introduced such names as Nagornaya Abkhaziya, 
Nagornaya Ingushctiya, Nagornaya Russia, etc. [171-172] 
I think that because the migrated Armenians did not live there (remember A.S.Griboyedov's werds. - 
A.M.) 
   So as a Communist, citizen and at last as a man who is not a stranger to patriotism, I think that it is high 
time for discussion and solution of the following suggestions: 
- the government of Azerbaijan should condemn the policy of apartheid carried on in Armenia during 
1965 - 1988 and deportation of 200 thousand of Azerbaijanians in 1988 - 1989; 
- to errect in Baku in the region of the square named after V.I.Lenin instead of fountains gratifying our 
eyes the monument to the murdered, beaten and driven away from their native places Azerbaijanians; 
- being aware of difficulty of this problem, as for 45 years after the Great Patriotic war was over, the 
government of Azerbaijan .yet cannot set the memorial to the lost during the war, to errect the memorial to the 
genocide victims using public money; 
- the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Azerbaijan SSR should discuss and solve, at last, the 
problem of making Karabakh autonomous region, by means of which to put an end the historical unjustice, to 
give all the inhabitants of Karabakh the right for self-determination. To create a powerful, economic potential 
 79
making it possible to apply efficiently material and manpower resources, to settle all deported Azerbaijanians in 
Karabakh region, in order that they would not die, as it was in 1946 - 1948, when out of 300 thousand of 
Azerbaijanians living in Nagornaya Armenia, but by force, according to Stalin's order and A.Mikoyan's 
"advice", having been settled in Azerbaijan lowlands only 29 thousand survived. We must know that moun-
taineers cannot live in lowlands, we must learn a lesson from the tragic destiny of ever - driven away Azerbaijan 
people. 
- to organize in the CPSU Central Committee the National Department (but not the Sector on the 
international relations), every candidature for working in the Department besides recommendations of the 
Central Committee should be "checked", thus, excluding penetration into the center of  [172-173] 
the party of such workers as Mikhailov, who due to his stupidity promised to deputies from NKAR in 
January 1988 to resolve this question in the positive; 
-  the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Azerbaijan SSR on the ground of general discussion should 
settle the question on setting the monuments in Shemakha, Shusha, Nakhichevan, Stepanakert, Agdam, 
Sumgait, Barda, Evlakh - To victims of the Armenian massacre committed by dashnaks and gnchakists in 1917 
- 1920 on the Azerbaijan territory when above 400 thousand of Azerbaijanians Were murdered. 
- to condemn by the Party and juridical court the organizers and their assistants of international discord 
and open anti-Sovietism, including Karen Demirchyan, Boris Gevorkov, Sergei Mikoyan, general Arutuynov 
and notorious regenerated were-wolves who joined fhem and whose criminal actions on the 70-th anniversary of 
the Soviet power resulted in the tragedy of peoples and could be a chain reaction for other republics and just that 
happened. 
- the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR should discuss the question on renaming the memorial 
of mythical "genocide"in Erevan, as the source of forcing misanthropic feelings of young people into memorial 
to the victims - Soviet people murdered for establishing of the Soviet power in Armenia; 
- in the spirit of decisions of the XIX Party conference and The I-st Congress of the USSR people's 
deputies to form, or strictly speaking, to recreate in Azerbaijan, as it was in the 60-s, Bakinskaya, 
Gyandzhinskaya, Shekinskaya, Muganskaya and some other regions. 
- for the USSR State Committee of Press to make every publication in Armenia, Azerbaijan and other 
regions of the country, which can arouse anti-Soviet feelings international clashes as the object of special 
discussion with participation of the parties concerned and decidedly to apply the law on criminal actions against 
the USSR peoples; 
- to discuss the question of party responsibility of S.Kaputikyan, Z.Balay-an, V.Petrosyan, 
A.Arzumanyan, M.Shatiryan, S.Khanzadyan, V.Ulubaby- [173-174] 
an, S.Mikoyan and others for instigating - extremist actions poisoning young people's minds with anti-
Sovictism; 
-  The Council on religious affairs at the USSR Soviet of Ministers must not allow the instigating actions 
of spiritual leaders, to control their acts, to take out of mosques, churches and other religious places appeals, 
pictures and all the materials which have nationalistic character (For example, in Echmiadzin in sight of 
everybody there is a picture of "Great Armenia " - is it really a religious affair. Since what time has geography 
become a prerogative of the church. - A.N.); 
-  at the regular session of the General Assambly of UNO on behalf of the Soviet government to condemn 
the international terrorism, its organizations, including the Armenian "ASALA", "Gnchak", "Dashnaktsutyun", 
"Vindictive commandoscs of the Armenian genocide" and "New Armenian resistance". 
- to set up military - party commission to hold an inquiry and to find the people guilty of genocide of 
Azerbaijanians in Armenia, to clarify how they managed to drive away 207 thousand of Azerbaijanians from 
their native places, to attract into this commission of representatives from the International association of 
lawyers and people's deputies of Azerbaijan and Armenia. 
    All these questions on the eve of the XIX All-Union party conference were sent as suggestions to the 
appropriate directive organs of the country and republic. Alas, just as during the best years of stagnation, "not a 
word from them". 
  When the Conference was over, on June 3, 1988, I was received and for about an hour (55minutes) I had 
a conversation with a member of the Politbureau of the CPSU Central Committee. These and other my 
suggestions found complete comprehension and moreover, he promised to take the most decisive revolutionary 
measures with respect to the leaders of the Armenian extremists. I was told that it was the opinion of the 
majority of members of the Politbureau. Who prevented them to take the promised measures puzzles me up to 
now. At present the matter depends on time which under condi- [174-175] 
tions of irreversible perestroika (renewal), glasnost (openness) and democratization, I hope, will put 
everything in their proper places 
   History and people of Azerbaijan will never forgive anybody this next in turn foul attempt to violate the 
rights and sovereignty of our country [175-176]

   Conscience and honor of the Russian people are focused in catch-words by Alexander Nevski: "Who 
comes with a sword will be killed by the sword." 
   Later, J.Stalin transformed their meaning;. "Who disobeys us, will meet our penalizing sword." 
   For many centuries the Azerbaijan people have been subjected to all kinds of attacks, insults and 
offenses. 
   Romans and Greeks, Persians and Arabs, Tatars and Mongols, Germans and English tortured Azerbaijan 
and its people, preventing its unity and spiritual community. 
   The people still persistently struggled for its existence, asserted its dignity and was looking forward the 
establishment of the state sovereignty. And only in front of the murderous clique of Stalin and his followers the 
[176-177] 
people hanged their heads (though did it only the Azerbaijan people? -A.M.) and become unprotected. 
    First. The whole flower of the nation, its intellectuals, was annihilated (the tragic events of 1937-1938 
had started for Azerbaijan since 1935. -A.M.) 
    Second. The unified Azerbaijan was dissected it into the Southern and Northern inside the latter the 
flash-points of future conflicts were laid down (NKAR, Nakhichevan. - A.M.) 
   Third. The history of the Azerbaijan people, by the direction of "the father of nations" was completely 
lied about by his pen-pushers. Tree times the alphabet and nationality were changed to deprive the people of its 
power, language and history, literally, the principle "divide and rule" reached such a peak the most atrocious 
tyrant of all times could not dream about. 
   But the civilized mankind must know the 25-million Azerbaijanian people will not be tolerable to the 
national insult, humiliation and arrogance. 
   Let the particular hystericans and pharisees know that Azerbaijanians will be firm and unshakable in the 
demand to recognize their right for existence, freedom and national sovereignty. 
   The savage history of the severe existence and surviving made the Azerbaijanians peaceful and friendly, 
compassionate for other peoples their friends in need, an oriental saying: "a distress of suppressed will not be 
absolved to oppressors" is very close to Azerbaijanians. 
   Just that is why since the very first days of the October revolution, historical decrees of peace and land 
declared by V.I.Lenin pushed up the Azerbaijan people to their option to be only with the Russian people, only 
with Lenin on the way of the national liberation, establishment of the state sovereignty and further blossoming 
forth the culture and language. 
   Practical steps undertaken by V.I.Lenin to strengthen good-neighbor relations with contiguous states, 
submit the real state sovereignty to Republics gave rise to the great respect, love and confidence of him and his 
government from peoples of Russia, Ukraine, Georgia, Azerbaijan, Afghanistan and others. 
  Of interest are the facts, preserved by the history, showing the reality of Lenin's national policy as for 
granting of the sovereignty and full state inde- [177-178] 
pendence to Republics. Below we give only two evidence: "Your Excellency, Ambassador! On behalf of 
Grand National Assembly and its Government as well as personally of myself I thank You for You have given 
us an opportunity today to experience a great joy. 1 especially appreciate this celebration as the Soviet 
Government of independent Azerbaijan has honored me to raise its national flag. 
   To my mind there is no need to explain the extent of frank and fraternal relations between Turkey and 
Azerbaijan. 
   To confirm and strengthen such fraternal relations the Azerbaijan government has appointed Ibragim 
Abilov Ambassador. 
   This is a very happy choice. As His Excellency Ibragim Abilov is a person who has been imbued with a 
spirit of the fraternal ties and has all features required for a successful execution of His mission that is such 
important for us as well. Even as far back as our first meetings he showed his exclusive talent and virtue. The 
government He represents also has a significant and valuable feature. 
   The AZERBAIJAN GOVERNMENT is THE PEOPLE'S GOVERNMENT. IT SELF-DETERMINES 
ITS DESTINY BEING A MASTER OF ITS OWN DESTINY..." (who could suppose that later J.Stalin would 
make null and void all the activity of V.I.Lenin in this respect and I.Abilov would be Liquidated by Stalin's 
agents. - A.M.) 
 81
   "... With a pride I want to remind about the happiness we feel today on occasion with the flag raising 
ceremony. Earlier we were honored in the same way by the respected Ambassador of Afghanistan. Your 
Excellency, our dear companion Abilov, I am raising the flag symbolizing the Azerbaijan independence and I 
feel my hands being moved by the emotions. In fact, these are my hands are raising the flag, but they are being 
effected by the feeling of the sincere and true fraternity of all Turkish people are present invisibly at the now 
celebration..." 
(From the speech of K.Ataturk on occasion of the flag raising on the building of the Azerbaijan 
SSR Plenipotentiary mission in October, 18.1921. - A.M.). 
   "...From now on the whole world knows about good-neighbor relations between our two nations. THE 
SOVIET RUSSIA GOVERNMENT HAS BEING DESIRED BY ALL MEANS AND IN ANY CASE TO 
CONFIRM ITS FAVOR AND GOOD-HEARTED FRIENDSHIP TO US. We, in turn. [178-179] 
always with the same true feelings met such contacts. THE TREATY BETWEEN US AND 
TRANSCAUCASIAN REPUBLICS WAS ANOTHER CONFIRMATION AND SUPPORT OF THAT WITH 
THE SOVIET RUSSIA... 
    ... The Treaty having been concluded with the Ukraine government, a close ally of the Soviet Russia, is 
an important and valuable for us from Iwo viewpoints. It will mean, first, the strengthening the already existing 
friendship with Russia and, second, the further development of line and good-hearted relations directly between 
Ukrainian and Turkish peoples. 
   With a very deep acknowledgement I thank ambassadors of Afghanistan, Azerbaijan and Russia for the 
feelings they have expressed in their congratulalions on the conclusion of the present Treaty. Comrade Frunze 
has also become our genuine companion. His visit is significant for us from more other points of view. 
Probably, somebody presumed that between Russian and Turkish peoples there were some discrepancies. Such 
presumptions could be a consequence of forged rumors spread by our ill-wishers. Actually they don't have any 
ground. The visit of His Excellency Frunze heading the extraordinary mission, the contacts he has set up, the 
reports he will make in his homeland as for his feelings arisen from his acquaintance with us, all these will be 
sufficient to deny any rumors about some so-called misunderstandings between us... 
   ... His Excellency Abilov has deigned to say that in the West there are some negotiations directed 
against oppressed nations. They may hold any negotiations but we have no doubts that finally they must come to 
a correct decision - to recognize rights of the oppressed. Honor and praise to the Russian people Leading the 
movement against the world of oppression! Long Live the Russian people and government of the Soviet Russia! 
Long Live the commander-in-chief of the Ukrainian Army, our companion, hero Frunze!" 
(From the speech of K.Ataturk at the reception given by the Commissariat of Foreign Affairs of 
Turkey in honor of Frunze in December, 30,1921.-A.M.). 
   "When the interpreting was over Frunze stood up and declared: "Long Live the Turkish Army! Long 
Live the Turkish people! Long Live Mustafa Kemal-Pasha!" 
   The Ukraine delegates and all the audience repeated in chorus all those wishes. There was a storm of 
applause. Those were visual results of the pol- [179-180] 
icy held by Lenin. But J.Stalin was at the wait-and see! He knows, moreover, he was sure that with the 
death of seriously ill Lenin he would be able to appropriate that policy, to get rid of those who were really 
beloved by the people and establish his personal dictatorship with a help of obsequiousers. (Nearly a year 
passed after V.I.Lenin's death, M.V. Frunze in 1925 was, literally, forced to be operated on a trivial appendicitis 
and died. Soon, K.Voroshilov, a close friend of J.Stalin, was appointed the people's Commissar of Defence. - 
A.M.). 
   And meanwhile, far-sighted Stalin even when Lenin was alive, being the General Secretary of the Party 
since April, (- A.M), when the Party Central Committee apparatus was just the executive body at the 
Politbureau, was selecting "a team" of his future devoted followers and companions such as Mikoyan, Beriya, 
Bagirov, Tovstukha, Malenkov, Kaganovich, Zhdanov, Yagoda, Yezhov, Poskrebyshev, Khruschev, Budenny, 
Bulganin, Saburov and many others. Those people represented the first echelon of cadres. Later on, those above 
mentioned Stalinists were preparing their own "followers." A unique one among all those bastards was 
obsequious unprincipled Mikoyan who could become useful as to Stalin so as to his followers as G.Malenkov, 
N.Khruschev, L.Brezhnev. But he knew his affairs distinctly. The nowadays bosses of "the Armenian problem" 
in many respects are obliged exclusively to him, a creator of a powerful Moscow, and not only Moscow, lobby 
in the USSR. I am more than convinced if A.Sakharov were not surrounded just by those people and he had an 
opportunity to know the truth about the history of NKAR and, in general, about the history of Azerbaijan he, 
with his intrinsic adherence to principles would have become a champion for the rights of the Azerbaijan people 
and their history. 
   But if one party is in a permanent tolerable silence adhering to principles of internationalism, by-passing 
the whole far-fetchedness of "the problem" and does not give a rebuff to lairs as for NKAR and, the other one 
 82
flooded the whole country with its publications of every stripe, where has to go a poorly informed, but 
accurately, a misled intellectual from Moscow and Leningrad, Kiev and Riga, Minsk and Vilnius, etc... 
   That's why the definite circumstances have forced me to elucidate, some darkened lines of history.[180-
181] 
   A political leader of any rank in his or her activity should have only one face, unshakable principles and 
firm confident program. From this point of view it is not easy to understand the political platform of the First 
Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communis! Parly of Armenia S.Arutyunyan who in 1988 at the XIX 
All-union Parly Conference declared principles of internationalism, unity and friendship among peoples and in 
1988 at the 1st Congress of People's Deputies he called for the confrontation on the ground of national-
chauvinism! What a supply of for such, a short in time and opposite in conviction, immediate alteration of his 
standpoint! However, nothing surprising! The transformation of Arutyunyan is deeply didactic and typical. This 
one with a thorough accuracy corresponds to a preprogrammed plot when in 1905 in Baku leaders of Armenian 
committees staged the first successful massacre of the Azerbaijanian population. 
   When the proletariat of Baku was getting ready for the first strike in Russia, Armenians had conducted 
their first "operation," by the way, being condemned by the Baku workers, Russians, Azerbaijanians, Georgians, 
Jews, Lezgins, Kurds, Persians and Germans. Many of deserving disciples of A.Mikoyan are going on to whip 
up the historic lie representing the 1905 events as "bloody collisions organized by the Russian administration 
between Tatars (refer to Azerbaijans. - A.M.) and Armenians to suppress the joint (?! - A.M.) class struggle of 
the toiling masses for their social and national liberation. Collisions between Armenians and Azerbaijanians 
were also provoked in Elisavetpol (Later Gyandja. - A.M.), Tiflis, Yerevan and Karabakh." And again a known 
tag is being preached as if Russians are guilty in every thing. Let's assume this is true. But then some questions 
arise. Why Russians (it means the Tsarist government. - A.M.) for 200 years had not organized such bloody 
collisions and why did they become possible just after the appearance of the first Armenian committees and par-
ties like Dashnaktsutyun and Gnchak?! 
    Why did the Russian Tsar Alexander released peacefully the great son of Daghestan Shamil who for 
more than 30 years had fought against the Russian administration? Why did not persecutions and collisions of 
Mountaineers take place? Don't misrepresenters of history hope the lie will be durable on the platform erected 
by them?! But let's be back to the history. [181-182] 
   So, on February Sunday 1905, in the center of Baku near the Armenian cathedral (beautifully restored in 
1987 and become even better. - A.M.) on the Parapet square Armenians killed Aga Rza Babaycv a resident of 
Sabunchi settlement of Baku district. 
   The news of murder rocketed about the population of Baku and became known to the whole Balakhany-
Sabunchi industrial area where Babayev had a lot of relatives and friends. Later on after the murder small 
groups of Azerbaijanians appeared in the streets nearest to the Parapet; they were met by shots from windows. 
Unarmed Azerbaijanians scattered and started to get armed with any means. The blood was shed, the first killed 
emerged. The first victims were students of the 7th form of the real and Technical Schools Yakov Lebedev and 
Ivan Volkov. 
   As for reports of Mikhailov city clinic for the day of February 6, 18 people were killed and 33 people 
were wounded including 6 Russians, 34 Azerbaijanians, 6 Armenians and 5 of other nations. 
   In February 7 the number of killed and wounded reached 100 people. 
   In February 9 the number of murders and massacres increased and they became fierce. In February 9, 
Armenians having got together in houses of their wealthy and rich fellows, and cast French and English make 
grenades and bombs on the streets. 
   Those were houses of "kings" of Armenians: Balabek Balayev, Artem Babayants, Isai Ter-Osipov, 
Nikolai Galustov, Aga Kasabov, Ruben Aslanov, Grigori Sarkisyanls, Mikhail Ter-Arutyunov, Artyom Ter-
Saakov, Andrey Babadjanov, Khachatur Adamov, Nikola Tatevosov, Mesrop Chakhmakhsarov, Akop 
Muradyan, Avetis Pogosov, Akop Akopyan, Petros Pogosov, Shirin Akopov, Arutyun Agavelov, Ogancz 
Cayadov, Andrcy Shakhbazov, Karen Saakyants, Agbar Djabarov and many others. 
   Mantashcv, Mirzabekov, Ter-Gukasov, Melikyants, Shakhbazian who were rich men made their 
million-worth profits secretly directed and sponsored the actions of Armenian fighters. 
   The reasons caused the events of February 6-10 were diverse. Those phenomena may be considered as 
only closest grounds for disorders occurred in the vast scale. [182-183] 
   Several murders of Azerbaijanians in Baku in 1904 already were symptoms and had to be in the scope 
of attention for the Baku Governor Prince Nakashidze and the Baku garrison Commander rear-admiral Bal. 
   Relations between Azerbaijanians and Armenians in the Transcaucasia existed since when Armenians 
with a help of A.Griboyedov, prince Argutyan, generals Lazarev and Ter-Gukasov HAD BEEN TEMPORARY 
SETTLED lo Baku, Karabakh, Shemakha, Nakhichevan, Gyandja and other locations. 
   Hampered Azerbaijanians Armenians compensated that by growing grapes and were involved in many 
trades. 
 83
   When Azerbaijan entered the Russian Empire Armenians were as if agents between the tsarist 
authorities and local population, they could win the confidence and were accepted for the government service. 
Some representatives of the tsarist autocracy preserved some distrust to Moslems in general as to those who 
fought against the Russian troops and as followers of Islam. They considered Azerbaijanians as the people alien 
in language, religion, manners and customs, unsubjected to any assimilation and those who with arms were 
ready to uphold their freedom and independence. Such attitude fed by Armenians gave them an opportunity to 
insult and offense the local population in every way. Leaders of the Armenian committees used a chance to 
inflict reprisals and unleash massacre, which came in to history as "Baku events of 1905." 
   It is worth noticing the memorandum by Senator Kusminsky arrived in Baku in March 2,1905 on the 
personal command of the Emperior to reveal reasons caused events of February 6-10. 
   " Moslems in the person of their representatives visited me as a delegation of 12 distinguished citizens 
of Baku, belonging to the top nobility, intellectuals and treacherous features due to, resorting to means, which 
are very often unscrupulous (if Gdlyan were not stopped he would have jailed a half of Uzbekistan. - A.M.) 
could succeed in obtaining not only a top wealth given them a possibility, under the government assistance and 
patronage, to upraise their culture by the free establishment of educational and charity institutions but mainly 
they could undermine the government confidence to Moslems showing them as wild, fanatic and unreliable in 
general. Moslems [183-184] 
state straightforwardly that reasons of the February events should be considered established between them 
and Armenians and caused such events. 
   WE, THEY SAY, HAVE SUBMITTED THEM SHELTER ON THE TERRITORY OF AZERBAIJAN. 
WE DO NOT FEEL ANY ENVY IN ARMENIANS AND WE DO NOT WANT TO INTERFERE IN THEIR 
DEVELOPMENT: LET THEM DEVELOP THEIR POTENTIAL IN ALL DIRECTIONS BUT LET THEM 
NOT MAKE OBSTACLES FOR MOSLEMS, LET THEM NOT HAVE A DESIRE FOR AN EXCLUSIVE 
RIGHT TO HOLD THE WELFARE OF THE COUNTRY AND DON'T THEY ENDEAVOR TO ENSLAVE 
MOSLEMS SPIRITUALLY AND MATERIALLY. 
    MOSLEMS EXPRESS THEIR AMBITION THAT THE GOVERNMENT OPINION BUILT ON THE 
BASIS OF DENOMINATION WOULD BE CHANGED AND MOSLEMS AS OTHER PEOPLES OF THE 
EMPIRE WOULD BE PROVIDED WITH EQUAL POLITICAL, CIVIL AND RELIGIOUS RIGHTS AT. 
LEAST BECAUSE THEY ARE MASTERS OF THEIR HOMELAND. 
   These considerations entirely refer to Baku where Moslems from time immemorial are the dominating 
population, where upon Armenians started to infiltrate within the period of origin of oil industry, i.e. 
approximately at the beginning of the seventies; their influx is especially noticeable for the recent 10-15-years 
and today they already constitute 15% of the urban population while the density of Moslems is 60%." 
   Of note is that the activity of extremist committees akin the modern "Krunk" and "Karabakh" became of 
a particular intensity when the law on secularization of the church property of Armenian clergy (June 12, 1903). 
Complaints of people and searches of Armenian churches in the Transcaucasia, Petersburg, Moscow, the North 
Caucasus, vicinities of Rostov revealed a great amount of arms and ammunition had preceeded the adoption of 
this law. 
    When the law was issued the exposed Armenian committee militants stepped up the unmasked, brightly 
expressed terrorist activity in a number of attempts and assassinations of all rank officials taking part in the law 
introduction starting with Adjutant-General prince Golitsyn as an initiator of this law issue. 
[184-185] 
   Meanwhile "Gnchyak" and "Dashnaktsutyun" in every way attempted to win round some part of 
Azerbaijanians. For that purpose already in 1904 in Baku "Armenian organization" spread leaflets offering 
Azerbaijanians to unite with Armenians for the joint actions against Russians. 
   The leaflets contained threats of using force in case of refusal. 
   "Be ready, - one of them said, - we will stain with your own blood your own land and commit your 
corpses to flames, which will envelop the whole world." 
   Azerbaijanians ignored those appeals and demanded to leave them beyond. 
  Senator Kuzminsky wrote: "Apparently, such provocations greatly spread in the Moslem world as 
threatening leaflets and responses of Moslem were published in Chakhra Numa magazine (Indicator of Truth) 
No. 18, March 25,1905, Alexandria (Egypt) in Persian. 
   When Azerbaijanians as for their nature alien to anti-Russian ambitions of Armenian extremists 
condemned appeals of the Armenian Committee then the rumor was flown over as if Armenians were going to 
use bombs against Azerbaijanians during a funeral procession. Those rumors were confirmed by some facts of 
killing Azerbaijanians and mass distribution of threatening letters. 
   Evidently, such provoking could stipulate the disturbance and agitation among Azerbaijanians. While 
those "committees" did not touch Azerbaijanians the latter were indifferent to their actions (nowadays events. -
A.M.)but when the committees showed their intention to make Azerbaijanians as a tool to achieve their selfish 
 84
goal it became clear that Azerbaijanians would not remain calm and indifferent at the thought to be killed by 
foreigners because of their nationalistic aspirations. 
   Since april 3, 1905 in Baku Armenian committee militants had plotted assassinations of officials, cast 
bombs into Azerbaijanians' houses. THEN ADJUTANT-GENERAL I.T.AMILKHVARI APPOINTED 
GOVERNOR-GENERAL OF BAKU DECLARED THE MARTIAL LAW, WHICH ITSELF COOLED 
DOWN, in some extent, TOO VIOLENT MILITANT TERRORISTS. 
   Newspapers of those days wrote as follows: "As it is known late in the eighties in Tiflis some Armenian 
schoolmasters organized a group which [185-186] 
began to publish "Gnchak" (Alarm Bell) magazine and the group called itself as Social Revolutionary 
Party of Gnchkists Soon, however, the editorial board of "Gnchak" was transferred to Geneva and then to 
London. The principle program of the Party was provided for “gathering under the yoke of three powers as 
Russia, Turkey, Iran and, having united, to create so-called “Great Armenia”. 
(Russkoye Slovo, No. 342, November 1907, St.Petersburg). 
   In 1897 in Balakhany (outskirts of Baku. - A.M.) a division of Gnchakist Party had already existed. 
   In January 1,1904 townsfolk and residents of near villages were attracted by a "special appeal" signed 
by the "Union of Gnchakisls," it said:" Our Majesty wants to take away the church properly and the order of the 
Radiant (cathalikos) is quite clear to disobey His Majesty (let's recollect of CPSU Central Committee and 
Appeal of M.S.Gorbachev to peoples of Armenia and Azerbaijan. -A.M.). 
   "Our representatives, - further said, - must give us true information from Yerevan and get know from 
katholikos, who through we may deal with Echmiadzin..." 
Of interest are conclusions by G.Plekhanov, which are completely similar to those by V.I.Lenin cited 
below. 
   " THIS, THE PARTY OF GNCHAKISTS INTRODUCED INTO THEIR PROGRAM THE TASKS 
RECIPROCALLY MAKING NULL AND VOID EACH OTHER AND ONLY ARTIFICIALLY 
CONNECTED: IF NATIONALISTIC IDEAS OF GATHERING ARMENIANS UNDER THE FLAG OF SO-
CALLED "GREAT ARMENIA" COULD UNITE PEOPLE OF THE MOST DIFFERENT SOCIAL AND 
ECONOMIC STATUS, THEN SOCIAL AND DEMOCRATIC AIMS, VICE VERSA, SEPARATED THOSE 
PEOPLE AND OF LIKE-MINDED MADE THEM OPPONENTS AS THE SOCIAL AND DEMOCRATIC 
THEORY DOES NOT ADMIT THE COMMUNITY OF INTERESTS FOR A CAPITALIST AND A 
WORKER BUT INVERSELY IT PRESUMES AN INEVITABLE STRUGGLE BETWEEN THEM. From the 
other hand, just in Turkey which was chosen by the parly as an exclusive place for its activity though the ground 
is cxtraordinary poor to develop the social and democratic activ-[186-187] 
ity because of the lack of industry there is no proletariat there. Such duality and unconcertion of the 
Gnchakist program was at the session of the Caucasian Social and democratic organization of working people 
being held in the mid of April 1905 had submitted a resolulion of the following content: "As the Gnchak Party is 
conducting a dual policy which is social and democratic from the other hand and as its organizational structure 
makes barriers between  workers of different  nationalities and  THUS  WEAKENS  THE PROLETARIAT 
SELF- CONSCIOUSNESS, WE WILL NOT HAVE ANY AGREEMENT  WITH   GNCHAKISTS   UNTIL  
THEY   COMPLETELY GIVE UP THEIR NATIONALISTIC ASPIRATIONS AND JOIN THE OR-
GANIZATION OF RUSSIA SOCIAL AND DEMOCRATIC PARTY OF WORKING PEOPLE!" 
   Such attitude of Marxists forced Armenian functionaries to organize, as a blind, new parties as 
"Dashnaktsutyun" or "Droshakist" which not setting forth any revolutionary ideas in the program published in 
1902, declared that their goal was to organize a forced revoll in Turkey and put the ground to create the 
Armenian Slate "from sea to sea." 
   Therefore, the goal of the Dashnaktsutyun coincided with those of Gnchakists and did not respond to 
interests of the Armenian people. They began to arm groups of youngsters and, arranged them in combat units, 
sent to Turkey to provoke mass disorders and prepare total actions of Armenians forced by arms. 
   In May 11,1905 Droshakists killed the Governor Prince Nakashidze whereupon in a leaflet published in 
connection with that, said: " The assassination of the Prince a secret inspircr and inofficial organizer of the 
events in February 6-10, was accomplished by the resolulion of all revolutionary organizations of Baku 
(Armenian) and executed by Droshakists only because this Party had the utmost rights for that." 
   The Union of Caucasian Armenian students also was established in Baku with its branch in Tiflis, which 
had its own printing shop founded by the engineer Tigran Bagdalyan. To arm Armenian students the foundry of 
Sarkis Pogosbekov in Bolshaya Telefonnaya street (now 28th April Slreet, Baku) made grenades, bombs and 
blasting shells. That case was not insignificant as nationalistic "leaders" of Armenian parties realized that it was 
necessary to think about the growing generation and bringing-up chauvinistic senti- [187-188] 
ments. There was no a more convenient place to obtain those goals as educational establishments of Baku, 
moreover, Azerbaijanians according to their religious traditions and mode of life rather unwillingly sent then 
their children for schooling.

    As classes in schools were held in Russian and with tuition fee, children of the poor, naturally, could 
not study there. 
   After the establishment of the Soviet power in Azerbaijan the opening schools for Azerbaijanian 
children met great difficulties and above cited letter of N.Narimanov to the editorial board of Bakinski Rabochy 
newspaper headlined "A response to some comrades" testified that. 
   A special digression has to be done here: as it is known, now a wide representation of Armenians in all 
branches of science, economy, Party and Government institutions, law-enforcement bodies, their impudent 
behavior, especially after 1985, frankly speaking, is provoking a covered indignation of Azerbaijanians and not 
only of them. 
   Actions of Armenian functionaries have obviously cynical character of impunity. Let alone Baltic 
regions, Ukraine and Belorussia all key positions and trading as well have been occupied by Armenians in all 
regions of the USSR and mainly in Stavropor area, Minvody, Uzbekistan, Krasnodar, Moscow, Alma-ata, 
Dushanbe, Frunze, Ashkhabad, Rostov-on-Don and many others. [188-189] 
    Since 1985 a new apostle of economy academician A.Aganbegyan has appeared. He has attracted 
attention of the dispairly disappointed general public by his overpromising publications and Speeches in mass 
media. 
   Premptory and explicit judgments of the academician have been of attraction and assurance in progress 
of the country hut everything takes time. For 4 years concepts of A.Aganbegyan have driven the country to the 
verge of economical disaster and famine. Not a bit confused Aganbegyan took up a great deal. Just him took up 
to solve the NKAR problem but neither in Baku nor in Yerevan but in Paris as a member of the Government 
delegation. There, after visiting of Andranik's gravestone he had a speech as for its "concept" in front of the 
audience of the known trend. 
   And if it took him four years to crush economy completely then as for international relations his 
"progress" was transient and tragic as well. 
   Another representative of "the fifth column" in the USSR Telman Gdlyan, an investigator of cases of 
special importance of the USSR Procurator's office has contributed immensely into the aggravation of 
international relations. For 6 years of his activity in Uzbekistan he "jailed" more than 8 thousand people and of a 
strange coincidence they were Uzbeks though anybody who, in a small extent, is informed as for the situation in 
Uzbekistan, knows pretty well that all key positions of "seamy" economy in this Republic, and not only there, 
have been occupied by Armenians. 
   It has been known that "exposes" by Gdlyan have been of an "objective" and "uncompromising" 
character. Of oddity is the fact that the head of Department for Struggle with misappropriates of the Socialist 
Property of the Uzbek SSR Ministry of Internal Affairs who is Armenian, has not been arrested, but with other 
Armenian officials in the Party, Soviet and Economy institutions of the Republic he has appeared among 
"exposers" of the corrupted clans. A very strange coincidence! Of a great concern are the facts remained beyond 
the sight. The point is, that tragic events in Fergana and other regions have been provoked by thugs from 
"Karabakh" committee who united with local bandits arranged an open massacre of Turks-Meskhets the 
majority of whom were officially registered as Azerbaijanians. 
   Thus, high-ranked provokers-extremists have continued the bloodshed massacre of Azerbaijanians 
beyond Armenia and NKAR. Secondly, they have discredited Georgians in front of the world general public, 
displayed   [189-190] 
them as direct heirs of Stalin and Beriya who deported more than 100 thousand Turks-Azerbaijanians in 
November 1944 from their homeland Meskhet-Djavakheti. Let Georgians now try to mention their problems, if 
 86
they, so-and-so, don't let the whole nation to come back to its true homeland. Third, they have created a tension 
in this region of the country made the USSR government to be apart from solution of urgent problems. 
    The final political goal of these national-extremists is to bring the country to the utmost aggravation of 
international relations but literally speaking- to unleash the civil war in the USSR! 
   The time is very convenient! If everything is getting away, if an incredible deportation of 
Azerbaijanians (as for their concept- Turks. - A.M.) is getting away, if an unbelievable opportunity to annex 
other lands has appeared, then why not to speed up and set forth "a historical problem." Just one point is 
unclear, why are Armenian expansionists missing such a small thing? Why are they begging only for the part of 
the Great Karabakh but not the whole territory? What a modesty, gentlemen?! You just could succeed to drag 
through a proposal by academician Sergei Ambartsumyan at the Session of the USSR Supreme Soviet 
Presidium dated to July 18,1988 concerning the presidential system of regulation in NKAR. 
   Since January 1989 Azerbaijan has got what you prepared, i.e. Committee of Special Management! 
What new tricks have you and your invisible patrons prepared for us? What is your second move? Don't slack 
you onslaught, don't forget to co-ordinate your each step, you new deed with advice of A.Aganbegyan and 
G.Borovik having a grand master rank in conducting refined provocations! 
   To a regret but it has to be accepted the liberal, with tints of palling, policy of some lop officials cither 
of their ignorance or of some another reasons plays into hands of inventors of such wild actions. 
    The unmasked provocative cynizm, militant embitterment displayed in speeches of some People's 
Deputies from Armenia in relation to Azerbaijan and lately in relation to M.Gorbachev aren't confirming such 
observations? 
    If someone seems that the power of Moscow "lobby" and its influence on the political life are miserable 
then it is a deep delusion. Let's remember when somebody of the Politbureau just dared to express his party 
evaluation of wide-scale actions of nationalists starting with K.Demirchyan and to Igor [190-191] 
Muradyan, then, as if by someone's conducting such an official found himself retired (A.Gromyko - A.M.) 
or the utmost of provocations embraced him. The member of Politburcau Yc.K. Ligachcv quite definitely 
referred to that at the Plenary Meeting (September 1989): "I will tell directly, did Y argue unambiguously 
against the border rearrangement for the two Trans-caucasian Republics, by the way just mention the Resolution 
of the Party Central Committee adopted in the last February, then that immediately exploded in no time. 
Everything like that is coming out from the same very known source." 
   Speeches by the former First Secretary of Party Central Committee of Georgia D.Patiashvili concerning 
Tbilisi events in April 1989 and Deputy Karyakin about the part of G.Borovik in bloodshed Czechoslovakian 
events of 1968 meet many thoughts. Repeated actions of extremists in Kazakhstan, disturbances in Moldavia, 
open centrifugal tendencies in Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia and Armenia under the cover of economical self-
support apparently will lead to a situation when we will have to transfer from the local extinguishing of the 
"hot" spots but to overwhelming measures as the declaration of special law all over the country! 
  At any rate prerequisites are already available. Recent disturbances in Belorussia, wakening Ukraine, 
permanent and persistent actions in the capilal of the state are accelerating such conditions. 
  The undistinguished anti-Soviet and anti-people sabbath undertaken by extremists of every strip under 
the motto:" Make a fuss, folks!" from the one hand and the threat of decay for our multi-national state to 
"independent" counties from the other hand is inadmissible. We should just hope the sooner the better the 
radical measures would be provided against the group of extremist and national-chauvinists!!! 
   To extinguish a local fire in the section of a huge building is more expedient rather than waiting for the 
total enveloping of the building. 
   The fifth year of restructuring along wilh economical failures also showed another fealures as a true face 
of haters of the Soviet Power who has been under the mask of its supporters for many decades. 
    The Azerbaijan people are full of determination to give an adequate rebuff lo the persistent and 
impudent territorial claims. [191-192] 
  In this historic struggle for freedom, national sovereignty and integrity the unfading images of immortal 
Ker-ogly, Babek, Mekhti Gusein-zade and Kafur Mamedov will inspire and unite my people! 
  Let them know, these "patriots of Great Armenia" and their hidden "advocates" in the USSR and abroad. 
Our descendants not once will shame high-rank ideologists and inciters of 1988-89 events in Armenia and 
Azerbaijan. We must always remember words of the Mexican national hero Obregan: "Don't be scared of 
enemies attacking you. Beware of flattering friends..." 
   Time and wisdom of peoples will pronounce their weighty utterance...
