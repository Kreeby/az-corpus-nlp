a full reference list at the end of the book.The appendix of the book contains information on old verb forms used in Shakespeare’s work along with the family trees of the Plantagenet and Tudor families.Some information on the ‘Wars of the Roses’ and the kings of England and France who ruled during the period of the plays are introduced as well.A 2000 word glossary of some of the words used in Shakespeare’s plays is presented after the appendix at the end of the book.S.Magill Qafqaz University Serap Magill & Shahin Khalilli 6 7 PART I:SHAKESPEARE AND HISTORY Serap Magill & Shahin Khalilli 8 Shakespeare’s English Historic Plays 9 King’s New School in Stratford 1.Shakespeare:A brief biography William Shakespeare was born in England in Stratford-upon-Avon.The parish register for the Holy Trinity church gives the date of his baptism as the April 26th of April 1564.It is interesting to note that the in the register of the Holy Trinity Church,that the parish clerk had written Guilelmus Filius Johannes Shakespeare.P.Ackroyd,in his biography of Shakespeare,tells us that the parish clerk slipped in his Latin and should have written Johannis.But the new born child’s godfather William Smith gave his name to the future poet as ‘William’(1).The exact date of Shakespeare’s birth is not known however,his birth date is traditionally celebrated on the 23rd of April.It is supposed that in 1571,Shakespeare entered King’s New School a charter school in Stratford,(seven years of age was the usual age for school admission at that time).Shakespeare did not have any university education.The fact that he did not have university education is quite remarkable when one considers the literary genius he was to exhibit later in his poetry and drama.On November 27th 1582,at Temple Grafton,the 18 year old Shakespeare married 26 year old Anne Hathaway who came from the nearby village of Shottery.The reason that Shakespeare did not attend university relates to his marriage to Anne Hathaway.Shakespeare could not attend university and keep a family,he had to work(1).In 1583,five months after William and Anne’s wedding Susanna the first child of William and Anne Shakespeare was born.Susanna died in 1649.Two more children were born to Shakespeare and his wife in 1585,the twins Hamnet and Judith Shakespeare.The children Serap Magill & Shahin Khalilli 10 were named after Hamnet and Judith Sadler,close friends and neighbours who owned a baker’s in Stratford.Ackroyd notes that Shakespeare’s son’s name Hamnet could have been pronounced and spelled Hamblet (in Shakespeare’s time chimney was pronounced as chimbley)or of course Hamlet.Hamnet died in 1596 and Judith died in 1662.Shakespeare lost his son when the boy was ten and a half years of age.We think of the tragic fate of the poet’s son Hamlet who was so dear to Shakespeare as every son is to his father and that perhaps compelled Shakespeare to write his world-wide famous tragedy ‘Hamlet’ between 1599 and 1601.There is much controversy as to the religion that Shakespeare professed.It is known that he came from a Roman Catholic family and had many friends who were Roman Catholics,but he never seemed to profess any particular religious bias.Perhaps he was a secret catholic as the laws of that time forbade anyone from actively following of the catholic religion.From the United Kingdom Government National Archive we can read the following account relating to the Elizabethan period:Catholic Recusants Domestic Records Information 66 1.Recusancy-a New Offence Elizabeth I,coming to the throne in November 1558,was queen of a country at risk of division on religious lines between Protestant and Catholic.In 1559,an Act of Uniformity imposed fines on all men who refused to attend Church of England services at their parish church; in 1563,the death penalty was imposed on priests who said mass.Later laws imposed numerous penalties and fines for non-attendance at Anglican services,and Catholics were effectively barred from inheriting land,entering the professions or taking up civil or military office:because they could not accept the monarch as Head of the Church,they could not be loyal subjects.In the eighteenth century,active discrimination was largely allowed to lapse,although formal Catholic emancipation was not to come until 1829.(29)Elizabethan times were dangerous times in which to practice or propagate Roman Catholicism and it would appear that Shakespeare was a very prudent man when it came to publicly promulgating any religious point of view.Shakespeare’s English Historic Plays 11 In a number of Shakespeare’s plays Roman Catholic clerics and papal representatives are portrayed negatively by being shown to be to be individuals who are devious,sycophantic or meddling.One can mention here Cardinal Wolsey.For instance note King Henry’s response to Cardinal Wolsey and Cardinal Campeius.Henry VIII.[Aside].I may perceive These cardinals trifle with me:I abhor This dilatory sloth and tricks of Rome.My learn'd and well-beloved servant,Cranmer,Prithee,return:with thy approach,I know,My comfort comes along.Break up the court:I say,set on.(Act III,i.)Rome is Henry’s metonym for the papal interference in his affairs; it is not the city that King Henry berates but the clerics.And again King Henry is speaking directly to Gardiner the bishop of Winchester on the Bishop’s sycophancy:Henry VIII.You were ever good at sudden commendations,Bishop of Winchester.But know,I come not To hear such flattery now,and in my presence; They are too thin and bare to hide offences.To me you cannot reach,you play the spaniel,And think with wagging of your tongue to win me; But,whatsoe'er thou takest me for,I'm sure Thou hast a cruel nature and a bloody.… (Act V.ii.)It is quite possible that Shakespeare is paying service to the virulent anti-Roman Catholicism which was apparent during the reigns of Queen Elizabeth I and James I.One,Robert Debdale,a fellow pupil of Shakespeare’s,was arrested and executed for propagating the Catholic religion (1)Some researchers and academics claim that Shakespeare was a covert Roman catholic although he may not or dare not have manifested the faith in public.It is believed that Shakespeare left Stratford sometime between 1585 and 1592,and joined a company of actors as a performer and playwright.Little is known of Shakespeare’s life from 1585 to 1592.Serap Magill & Shahin Khalilli 12 Sometime between 1589 and 1590,Shakespeare probably wrote Henry VI,Part One.The dates given for the composition of Shakespeare’s plays,though based in scholarship,are somewhat conjectural.In the period 1590-91:Shakespeare probably wrote Henry VI,Part Two and Henry VI,Part Three.From the performance of his earliest plays,Shakespeare became known in London as an actor and playwright.In a pamphlet published by the playwright Robert Greene ‘A Groat’s-worth of Wit’*,1Greene chides Shakespeare as being an ‘upstart crow’ on the theatre scene.Greene charged that Shakespeare ‘is an unschooled player and writer who ‘borrowed’ material from his well-educated betters for his own productions’.Thus,Greene harped back to Shakespeare’s lack of university education.In 1592,London theatres are closed due to plague.With the theatres closed Shakespeare may have turned to writing poetry.In 1593 he wrote and published ‘Venus and Adonis’ and in 1594 ‘The Rape of Lucrece’ Over the next 20 years or so,Shakespeare wrote many plays and a complete set of 154 sonnets and some major poems and many others.Shakespeare’s output was prodigious and he gained wealth and reputation from his work.It is said that Shakespeare used the Bodleian Library in Oxford.The library was founded in 1602.The poet dramatist habitually lunched at Oxford on his journeys from London to Stratford.That fact gives us to understand that Shakespeare probably used the library for research and edification when he was 38 years old,thus his self-education or research in the library and perhaps in other places too,made up for his lack of university education.William Shakespeare died on April 23,1616 and was buried two days later in the chancel of Holy Trinity Church where he had been baptized 52 years earlier.Shakespeare’s wife Anne Hathaway Shakespeare died in 1623.* A Groat was an English silver coin worth four pence Shakespeare’s English Historic Plays 13 2.Shakespeare’s literary life Shakespeare’s work is unique in English drama,literature and language.Through his work,he exerted an influence on the English language that no writer before him did and that no other writer is likely to do again.Shakespeare wrote at a time when the English language was changing from old English into a language nearer to the one we use today.Shakespeare helped to ‘modernise’ and expand the English language as he introduced many new words and phrases into the English language and gave new meaning to many existing words.Many of Shakespeare’s words and phrases are still commonly used among many English speaking people,although the way in which he used the English language and its spelling in his plays is now considered archaic.When Polonius asked Hamlet “What do you read,my lord?” Hamlet nonchalantly and enigmatically replied “Words,words,words”.(‘Hamlet’,act II scene ii)In that brief exchange between Polonius and Hamlet,Shakespeare is perhaps showing his own fascination and interest with the dynamic aspects of the vocabulary of the English language.The following wonderfully constructed passage by the British writer and journalist Bernard Levin gives us a very good idea that Shakespeare’s language is still very much alive and used every day among many English speakers,native and otherwise:‘If you cannot understand my argument,and declare ‘It’s Greek to me’,you are quoting Shakespeare;’ if you claim to be more sinned against than sinning,you are quoting Shakespeare; if you recall your salad days,you are quoting Shakespeare; if you act more in sorrow than in anger,if your wish is father to the thought,if your lost property has vanished into thin air,you are quoting Shakespeare; if you have ever refused to budge an inch or suffered from green-eyed jealousy,if you have played fast and loose,if you have been tongue-tied,a tower of strength,hoodwinked or in a pickle,if you have knitted your brows,made a virtue of necessity,insisted on fair play,slept not one wink,stood on ceremony,danced attendance (on your lord and master),laughed yourself into stitches,had short shrift,cold comfort or too much of a good thing,if you have seen better days or lived in a fool’s paradise-why,be that as it may,the more Serap Magill & Shahin Khalilli 14 fool you,for it is a foregone conclusion that you are (as good luck would have it)quoting Shakespeare; if you think it is early days and clear out bag and baggage,if you think it is high time and that that is the long and short of it,if you believe that the game is up and that truth will out even if it involves your own flesh and blood,if you lie low till the crack of doom because you suspect foul play,if you have your teeth set on edge (at one fell swoop)without rhyme or reason,then-to give the devil his due-if the truth were known (for surely you have a tongue in your head)you are quoting Shakespeare; even if you bid me good riddance and send me packing,if you wish I was dead as a door-nail,if you think I am an eyesore,a laughing stock,the devil incarnate,a stony-hearted villain,bloody-minded or a blinking idiot,then-by Jove! O Lord! Tut,tut! For goodness’ sake! What the dickens! But me no buts-it is all one to me,for you are quoting Shakespeare’(15).Dr Samuel Johnson (1709-1784),a famous man of letters,said in his famous preface to Shakespeare:Shakespeare is above all writers,at least above all modern writers,the poet of nature; the poet that holds up to his readers a faithful mirrour of manners and of life.His characters are not modified by the customs of particular places,unpractised by the rest of the world; by the peculiarities of studies or professions,which can operate but upon small numbers; or by the accidents of transient fashions or temporary opinions:they are the genuine progeny of common humanity,such as the world will always supply,and observation will always find.His persons act and speak by the influence of those general passions and principles by which all minds are agitated and whole system of life is continued in motion.In the writings of other poets a character is too often an individual; in those of Shakespeare it is commonly a species.*1 As a total entity,Shakespeare’s work (thirty-seven plays,a set of 154 sonnets and a number of major poems and songs),in its breadth and quality and perceptive analysis of human behaviour,has never been surpassed by any other writer of drama or fiction.Some scholars note that in England before the advent of Christopher Marlowe,there were few if any historic plays written that were of any great value or importance.But Marlowe’s works should be accepted as the first historical drama of the renaissance period.The * Note the spellings of some of the words in this passage are archaic.Shakespeare’s English Historic Plays 15 greatest drama of the Elizabethan period rose to its height due to Shakespeare’s English historic plays.Peter Ackroyd acknowledges that ‘Tamburlaine’ influenced the shape of Shakespeare’s history plays and the history plays in turn seem to have affected Marlowe’s composition of ‘Edward II’.It is even possible that they collaborated on aspects of the trilogy concerning ‘Henry VI’.As has already been observed the young Shakespeare no doubt also acted in ‘The Jew of Malta’ and ‘The Massacre of at Paris’.That he was mightily impressed and influenced by Marlowe is not in doubt; it is also clear that in his earliest plays Shakespeare stole or copied some of his lines,parodied him and generally competed with him …’(1)If Marlowe is accepted or valued as a dramatist Shakespeare wrote plays and poetry,he did not write novels.His work was meant to be preformed by actors on a stage and most of his plays were written to be performed in the Globe theatre.Shakespeare’s work is of such quality that it gives something to everyone who either watches the play performances for pleasure or who researches the drama texts for illumination.Shakespeare holds a unique place in English drama and literature but he also is considered to be one the greatest universal playwrights,thus his work is worthy of continued research and study.3.The Globe Theatre The Globe theatre was the playhouse for which Shakespeare wrote most of his plays.It was built in 1599,but burned down in 1613 and was opened again in 1614.It was demolished in 1644 when the Puritans ordered all theatres closed.Architecturally,the Globe was a roughly polygonal building with an internal ‘tiring house’ construction partly overhanging the stage.The stage itself was an ‘apron stage’ that projected out into a central courtyard,Serap Magill & Shahin Khalilli 16 which was open to the sky.The Globe was owned by a professional company called the Lord Chamberlain’s Players and later,from 1603 to the beginning of the Jacobean period it was owned by the King’s Men.Shakespeare was a shareholder,the company’s main playwright,and an occasional actor.The basic entrance fee for the Globe was a penny,entitling the spectator to use the standing room in the open ‘Yard’.People standing in the Yard were called ‘Groundlings’.People who could pay an extra penny were entitled to a seat in one of the galleries the ‘two-penny rooms’.The foundations were laid in 1991 for a new globe theatre to be built in London.The New Globe Theatre opened it doors to the public for its first performance in August 21st 1996.The first play to be performed was Shakespeare’s ‘Two Gentlemen of Gerona’.The New Globe is modelled on the original Globe theatre of Shakespeare’s time.4.Historic plays Why were the historic plays written? P.Ackroyd notes that ‘the English loved spectacle and rhetoric; they loved sweet and powerful orations.That was what 16th century stage was about’(1).It was Shakespeare in his prime who brought Englishness to his nation.And it was the time when ‘the lion –hearted’ Elizabeth I,did much for the prosperity of England,its culture and its literature.There was a desire and eagerness of the English nation and its Queen to know as much as they possibly could about their historic background.It was Shakespeare who fulfilled that historical mission.Shakespeare’s English Historic Plays 17 Drama was one of the bases of Elizabethan teaching.It was Christopher Marlowe who established the foundations of the English historic plays when he wrote his ‘Tamburlaine the Great’ on a Turkic theme.Beverley E.Warner tells us in her ‘English History in Shakespeare’s Plays’ that:‘From King John to Henry VIII.,from Magna Charta to the Reformation,whether conscious or not of the splendid scope of his achievement,the poet historian has sung an immortal epic of the English nation,having for its dominant note the passing of feudalism and the rise of the common people.’ (Warner,English History in Shakespeare’s Plays,New York,1899)Shakespeare wrote seventeen history plays,all but one of them near the end of the sixteenth century.Ancient History plays English plays Cymbeline Henry VI,Part II Pericles Henry VI,Part III Macbeth Henry VI,Part I Julius Caesar Richard III Antony and Cleopatra Richard II King Lear King John Timeon of Athens Henry IV,Part I Henry IV,Part II Henry V Henry VIII Shakespeare’s historical plays,according to Professor Bertrand Evans,account for ‘nearly half the total of Shakespeare’s plays.’.However Professor Evans includes in his count every Shakespeare play which has a distinct regal historical content,for example King Lear,Macbeth,Julius Caesar,Antony and Cleopatra,Coriolanus and Cymbeline.Shakespeare’s historical plays relate to two different distant historic periods.One group of historic plays,those,which Shakespeare wrote on periods of Athenian,Roman,English and Scottish history and those pre-date Shakespeare’s time by a considerable number of years,by about 500 years in the case of Macbeth and over one thousand years in the case of Julius Caesar.Serap Magill & Shahin Khalilli 18 The other group of plays covers a period of English history around and during and after the Wars of the Roses and the English wars with France.Much nearer Shakespeare’s time was the ‘Wars of the Roses’.The ‘Wars of the Roses’ is a phrase used to describe the civil wars in England,between the House of Lancaster and The house of York from the middle to late 15th century.The name of the war derives from the rose emblems used by both houses,the white rose for York and the red rose for Lancaster.Incidentally,the Tudor rose is combination of the white rose of York and the red rose of Lancastrians.Evans statement above takes account of Shakespeare’s work in total but this volume deals only with Shakespeare’s English historic plays in the second group mentioned above.The historic source material used by Shakespeare for the production of most of his English historical plays was taken from the well known ‘Chronicle of English history’ by Raphael Holinshed.One might also want to argue that Macbeth,also based on the Holinshed Chronicle,is a historic play as Macbeth was a king of Scotland (1005 – 1057)but this play is classed as tragedy in most play lists.What evidence do we have of a historical background influencing the English drama of the middle age and renaissance period? One should note that Seneca’s tragedies were translated into English and brought together in 1581 in the form of ‘Ten Tragedies’.The first English tragedy performed as early as 1561 for an audience was Sackville and Norton’s ‘Gorboduc’ which was a direct imitation of Seneca.But English theatre had its formal beginnings in the Latin liturgical enactments of the church.“Only however with the rise of the so called ‘university wits’,men who chose to make their living by writing for the public theatre after following a course of study at one of the traditional centres of learning and gaining a certain notoriety as literary bohemians,did the possibilities of the new theatre begin top take shape.Robert Greene and George Peele were among the first to appeal consciously to a wider theatre going public and to introduce new conceptions of dramatic form”(26)Thanks to Christopher Marlowe (1564 – 1593)who fired the imagination of English audiences when he created the Scythian figure from the orient with the play called ‘Tamburlaine the Great’ Shakespeare’s English Historic Plays 19 ‘Where shall you hear the Scythian Tamburlaine Threatening the world with high astounding terms And kingdoms with his conquering sword’ Noted in the prologue of Tamburlaine the Great’ part I.Christopher Marlowe was accepted and is valued as a genuine meteoric figure in English drama.But Shakespeare who lived 23 years longer than his rival and contemporary Marlowe discovered ‘the Historic Plays of orthodox England and its Kings.Shakespeare’s earliest three plays on the reign of Henry VI (1591 – 1592),present history with its dramatic and realistic colour,but the dates of Henry VI,pt.I and the extent to which the hand of Shakespeare is to be detected in it has been the subject of much discussion.Most scholars are now inclined to recognise Shakespeare’s authorship and to propose a date which may be as early as 1591.In this case the play is likely to have preceded Marlowe’s ‘Edward II’ and Shakespeare can be thought of as the creator of the history play as a serious dramatic form(26).5.Chronology of the English historic plays Dating when Shakespeare wrote his plays has proved for many researchers and academics to be a very difficult task,due to the lack of evidence,which could conclusively give exact dates for the writing of the plays.Many researchers have given conflicting views on exactly when Shakespeare wrote his plays.* * The date of the first performance of the play is in dispute,some academics give the first recorded performance date as late as 1737.First Performed Plays First Printed 1590-91 Henry VI Part II 1594? 1590-91 Henry VI,Part III 1594? 1591-92 Henry VI,Part I 1623 1592-93 Richard III 1597 1595-96 Richard II 1597 1596-97* King John 1623 1597-98 Henry IV,Part I 1598 1597-98 Henry IV,Part II 1600 1598-99 Henry V 1600 1612-13 Henry VIII 1623 Serap Magill & Shahin Khalilli 20 Accordingly,the first performance or the first printing dates are sometimes used to fix the chronological order of Shakespeare’s production of the plays.As you can see from the table above the year of the first performance for any of the plays shown is approximate,but the year of the first printing is know with much more certainty.Shakespeare wrote two series of four plays (two tetralogies)the second of which dealt solely with the events of the Wars of the Roses.The first tetralogy plays was written very early in Shakespeare’s career and was followed much later by the second tetralogy.The Second tetralogy is sometimes called the ‘Henriad’ after being so named by the American professor Alvin B.Kernan from his article ‘The Henriad:Shakespeare’s major Historic Plays’(11).Some scholars include the eight plays under the title of the ‘Henriad’ The first tetralogy of historical plays THE PLAYS ON THE WARS OF THE ROSES The second tetralogy of historic plays Henry VI Pt.1 Richard II Henry VI Pt.2 Henry IV Pt.1 Henry VI Pt.3 Henry IV Pt.2 Richard III Henry V It is believed that these historic plays,sometimes called cycles or series,were not necessarily meant to be performed in any linear sequence.However,the plays are sometimes performed as a ‘marathon’ in sequence.Note that Shakespeare did not write the plays in a historical chronological order.In the tetralogies Shakespeare refers to ‘England’ 247 times and to ‘English’ 173 times.The content of the plays indicate that Shakespeare was at heart an English nationalist.He was patriotic.Andrew Sanders in his work ‘History of English Literature’ tells us that it is hardly surprising that the reference to these two words (England,English)should be found so many times in the historic plays.The intensely nationalistic ‘King John’ for instance mentions England no less than 43 times,in Henry V 45 times and in Henry VIII 12 times(21).Shakespeare’s English Historic Plays 21 For many anthologists the central statement of Shakespeare’s feeling for his English homeland occurs in Richard II as the dying John of Gaunt considers to himself “Methinks I am a prophet new inspired” and continues with the famous soliloquy… “This royal throne of kings,this scepter’d isle,This earth of majesty,this seat of Mars,This other Eden,demi-paradise,This fortress built by Nature for herself Against infection and the hand of war,This happy breed of men,this little world,This precious stone set in the silver sea,Which serves it in the office of a wall,Or as a moat defensive to a house,Against the envy of less happier lands,This blessed plot,this earth,this realm,this England.” (Richard II,Act II,i.)Another two plays,which make up Shakespeare’s historic play collection,are King John and King Henry VIII.The King John Play is set in the mid 12th to early 13th century.King Henry VIII play is set after the Wars of the Roses in the early to mid 16th century.The Group of historic plays are of unequal length and are shown here by the number of lines in each play.Richard III 1,224 Henry V 853 Henry IV,Part II 987 Henry VIII 788 Henry VI,Part III 949 Henry VI,Part I 787 Henry VI,Part II 921 Richard II 636 Henry IV,Part I 884 King John 621 Serap Magill & Shahin Khalilli 22 6.Period covered by the English Historic plays Shakespeare’s ten English historic plays cover a period of English history and to a much lesser extent that of French history over the period of the reigns of King John in the late 12th century,to Henry VIII in the mid 16th century.Shakespeare did not write plays for every monarch who reigned during that period.There are no plays written for King Henry II,Henry III,King Edward I,King Edward IV,King Edward V and King Henry VII.However,recently the Play Edward III has been credited to Shakespeare.* We should note that Shakespeare played with history and often changed the facts of historic events and their dates to suit the plots he wrote for his plays and certainly to telescope historic time into the duration of the play and perhaps also because of the political situation prevailing at the time he wrote the plays.His plays are fiction although they mention historic events that did happen.Many of the characters in his plays are modelled on real people who actually lived through the historic events given in the plays.Some characters,as one might expect,Shakespeare invented.That period of English history,which is covered by the historic plays,the early 12th century to the late 15th century,was very turbulent politically as from the late 13th century the threat of a Scottish invasion of the north part of England was always present and on most occasions a reality.From around 1333 until the reign of James I there was a continual war with France.Border warfare between England and Scotland did not cease until the coming of James 1st of England**1 in 1603,when the two countries were ruled under one king.In those times England was medieval in nature and the poor were very poor and had serf status until around 1500 when serf status had all but died out but in some facets of serfdom continued until the 17th century.Witches and heretics were burned at the stake for their apparent evil deeds or beliefs.Minor crimes could incur very heavy penalties and criminals were cruelly punished by flogging,disfigurement or hanging.London was a * See Appendix 3 ** James I of England was also James VI of Scotland.Shakespeare’s English Historic Plays 23 very vibrant place but full of violence.Most gentlemen carried a sword or dagger and these were worn for protection not for decoration.William Hazlitt tells us in his ‘Characters of Shakespeare’s Plays’,that ‘During the time of the civil wars of York and Lancaster,England was a perfect bear-garden,and Shakespeare has given us a very lively picture of the scene.’ London was subject to no less than 16 outbreaks of the bubonic plague between 1348 and the Great Plague of 1665.It has been estimated that one third to one half of the population of England died as a result of the bubonic plague.Monarchs at that time in England had complete power,the Tudors were tyrannical and it is said that under the reign of Henry VIII at least 70 000 people were executed.Ralph Holinshed notes the severity of Henry VIII reign:‘Henry the Eighth,executing his laws very severely against such idle persons,I mean great thieves,petty thieves,and rogues,did hang up threescore and twelve thousand of them in his time.’ [Holinshed Chronicles,1577,Book III,Chapter 6; 1587,Book II,Chapter II] The English royal courts of the time were hives of conspiracy as many nobles and courtiers vied with each other to seek personal or political advancement and the evidence for individual political advan-cement and conniving in royal courts can be seen in Shakespeare’s English historic plays.Prolonged spells of peace in England during the middle ages were unknown.Royal domestic politics and disputed regal successions within the Plantagenet family caused the wars of the Roses (1455– 1485)and the outcome ended the three century dynastic rule of the Plantagenet family.King Philip of France took the opportunity to aid his ‘Auld’ ally Scotland,when it was attacked by England in 1333 and reclaim Gascony from the English.Open Warfare between England and France started in earnest in 1337 and continued for 116 years until the last Battle of the so called hundred year’s war,the battle of Castillon in 1453.However,the English kept a foothold in France,but were eventually repulsed at the start of the reign of Elizabeth I in 1558 when the French retook Calais.Serap Magill & Shahin Khalilli 24 It was not until 1802 that Britain finally recognised the French Republic by the Treaty of Amiens and gave up all pretensions to the French crown.The temporal setting for Shakespeare’s historic plays is the England of Chaucer and Caxton the period of the late Middle Ages to the start of the English renaissance.King Richard III’s death at the battle of Bosworth in 1485 ended the Plantagenet dynasty and signalled the start of the Tudor dynasty under King Henry VII when,according to Shakespeare,Henry the earl of Richmond was apparently crowned king of England on the battlefield after his victory.The reformation*1about which little or nothing is said in the English historic plays had a great effect on England’s relationship with catholic Europe.The religious theology introduced into England and Scotland from northern continental Europe changed people’s views on worship and tended to isolate England from its continental neighbours.John of Gaunt’s dying soliloquy gives evidence to the idea of isolation although the effects of the reformation were perhaps more apparent during the reigns of Elizabeth I and Henry VIII rather than in the reign of King Richard II.The ‘Tudor Myth’ gives us to understand that the Plantagenet period was one of dark deeds misrule and murder whereas the Tudor dynasty with its declaration of the divine rights of Kings developed into a dynasty of peace and plenty.Reflection and research on that period of history allows us to realize that the ‘Tudor Myth’ is indeed a myth.The start of the Tudor dynasty in 1485 is also accepted by some as a convenient date for the end of the English Middle Ages(16)and the start of the English renaissance.However,G.M.Trevelyan in his work ‘English Social History’ claims that it is very difficult,if not impossible to determine exactly when the English Middle Ages ended,although he concedes that the reign of * John Calvin (1509 – 64)and Martin Luther (1483-1546)were the main instigators of the reformation on the continent.In Scotland John Knox (1510-1572)was a virulent opponent of Roman Catholicism and a prime mover in the Scottish reformation.Shakespeare’s English Historic Plays 25 the Tudor King,Henry VIII,‘… is that which fixes the gulf between medieval and modern history’(27).Probably the most well known of the Tudor kings is Henry VIII.Shakespeare’s play ‘Henry VIII’ covers the intrigues and fall of Cardinal Wolsey; the rise of Cranmer; King Henry’s attempts to annul his marriage with Katherine of Aragon to allow him to marry Anne Boleyn (Anne Bullen).It is probably no accident or oversight that Shakespeare did not mention the beheading of the devout Roman catholic Sir Thomas More in his Henry VIII play.Henry VIII had Thomas More beheaded for treason because More,on catholic religious grounds,rigorously objected to his attempt to annul his marriage with his wife Queen Katherine.Possibly an even more rigorous objection to Henry’s annulment plans were those of Archbishop Fisher who was also beheaded by Henry VIII for treason.Although James I was the king at the time the play ‘King Henry VIII’ was written,it might have been deemed dangerous to appear to be too critical of Henry,as Henry was Queen Elizabeth’s father and Henry’s death was only 73 years earlier in 1547.The earliest historical setting of any of Shakespeare’s English historic plays is ‘King John’.Neither the ‘King John’ nor the ‘Henry VIII’ plays are included in the tetralogies of historic plays.The temporal setting for the ‘King John’ play is early medieval England.Surprisingly,Shakespeare makes no mention in his play,of one of the most important events in King John’s reign,a very serious baron’s revolt against King John and the subsequent signing by King John of the Magna Carta at Runnymede in 1215.Equally odd is Shakespeare’s exclusion of Wat Tyler’s peasant revolt of 1381 from the narrative of his ‘Richard II’ play.The revolt was one of the most serious insurrections in British social history.London was captured by the rebels,shops were looted and many important people were executed by the rioting mob.The boy King Richard aged 14 at the time,met the rioters at mile-end in London and granted a free pardon to the rebels and offered a new rent for farming land.The leader of the riot,Wat Tyler was subsequently killed in front of a mob in Smithfield and the concessions made to the mob were later overturned by parliament(27).Serap Magill & Shahin Khalilli 26 The Death of Wat Tyler Shakespeare masterfully displayed the image and history of the time and the English kings of the period.The English Historic plays inspired the English perception of the English national past and of nationhood.One might agree that ‘… Shakespeare can be thought of as the creator of the history play as a serious dramatic form’(26)7.Critical approaches to Shakespeare’s work Would we have such a great interest in the work of the other English dramatists that were contemporary with Shakespeare,if it were not for the fact that that Shakespeare produced such magnificent work? I think not,it is perhaps,the work of Shakespeare,which has given us the motivation to study the works of other English dramatists of the English renaissance period.Shakespeare’s English Historic Plays 27 Shakespeare’s works are unrivalled for their perception of human behaviour.Shakespeare’s work can be analysed in many different ways and from many points of view,but nearly every analysis will lead us back to the behaviour of the characters that inhabit his plays.It is the personality and the behaviour of the characters,which makes Shakespeare’s work so special.As Henry James has told us,‘What is character but the determination of incident,what is incident but the determination of character?’(6)According to James,character and incident are inexorably linked; one cannot exist without the other,similarly in Shakespeare’s plays incident is inexorably linked to character.In every one of the historic plays,we can observe manifestations of power and the ends to which kings and others will go to achieve their objectives.The events,which occur in Shakespeare’s historic plays,occur because of the behaviour of his characters.Accordingly,we can look at the initiation and manifestation of that behaviour and analyse its consequences through the concept of Manichean binaries or the dualism of opposites.We can observe the following polarizations in a number of different characters:Honour Treachery Legitimacy Usurpation Vengeance Nemesis Appearance Reality Fortune Ambition Authority Rebellion Kindness / love hate Polarisation of behaviour The following example in this brief introduction can be used to develop an analysis of characterizations based on the binary oppositions shown in the behaviour of the characters.Prince Hal and Hotspur One of the themes in the play ‘Henry IV’ is the characterization of Prince Hal.The play dynamically shows the development of Price Hal from an apparent wastrel who frequents inns and keeps bad company Serap Magill & Shahin Khalilli 28 to that of a mature young man who can command respect and rule a country.Hal’s characterization is dynamic,a transition from a hedonistic sybaritic condition to one of duty and responsibility.Note the low banter between Falstaff and Prince Hal:Falstaff.How now,how now,mad wag! what,in thy quips and thy quiddities? what a plague have I to do with a buff jerkin? Henry V.Why,what a pox have I to do with my hostess of the tavern? Falstaff.Well,thou hast called her to a reckoning many a time and oft.Henry V.Did I ever call for thee to pay thy part? Falstaff.No; I'll give thee thy due,thou hast paid all there.Prince Hal’s father King Henry IV is very worried about his son and compares his son’s idle behaviour unfavourably with that of Henry Percy known as Hotspur,a member of the powerful northern Percy family.We see in the characterization of these two young men a polarisation of characterization.Hotspur is a young man,who is known for his hot-headed courage and his responsibility to his family and for an even greater feeling for honour.Hotspur.By heaven,methinks it were an easy leap,To pluck bright honour from the pale-faced moon,Or dive into the bottom of the deep,Where fathom-line could never touch the ground,And pluck up drowned honour by the locks; So he that doth redeem her thence might wear Without corrival,all her dignities:But out upon this half-faced fellowship! Hotspur had the character of the son that Henry IV would liked to have had.Falstaff Falstaff is the second longest role in terms of lines in Shakespeare’s plays.Falstaff appears in ‘Henry IV’ pt.,1,‘Henry IV’ pt.,2,and ‘The Merry Wives of Windsor’.He is a buffoon,a comic character but Shakespeare’s English Historic Plays 29 should not be confused with the character ‘Sir John Fastolfe’ who appears in ‘Henry VI’ pt.,1.The character of Falstaff is called by some the greatest comic character in Shakespearian drama.He is seen as essential to the development of the character of Prince Hal.Interestingly the late Charles Laughton (1899 – 1962)a great English character actor of the 1930s-50s,who once took over the running of his family hotel from his father was once when asked if he would play the role of Falstaff,he refused the part and acerbically replied that he'd had to deal “with too many like that in the hotel.”(2)In Falstaff,we can see a man who lives on his wits.He is part coward,part con-man,a drunkard and very immoral.He is corrupter of youth and has no scruples about doing so.He is the antithesis of courage,honour and integrity.Falstaff.Hereof … with excellent endeavour of drinking good and good store of fertile sherris,that he is become very hot and valiant.If I had a thousand the first humane principle I would teach them should be to forswear thin potations and to addict themselves to sack.Henry IV,Part II[IV,3] Falstaff.I am accursed to rob in that thief's company:the rascal hath removed my horse,and tied him I know not where.If I travel but four foot by the squier further afoot,I shall break my wind.Well,I doubt not but to die a fair death for all this,if I 'scape hanging for killing that rogue.I have forsworn his company hourly any time this two and twenty years,and yet I am bewitched with the rogue's company.If the rascal hath not given me medicines to make me love him,I'll be hanged; it could not be else:I have drunk medicines.Poins! Hal! a plague upon you both! Bardolph! Peto! I'll starve ere I'll rob a foot further.An 'twere not as good a deed as drink,to turn true man and to leave these rogues,I am the veriest varlet that ever chewed with a tooth.Eight yards of uneven ground is threescore and ten miles afoot with me; and the stony-hearted villains know it well enough:a plague upon it when thieves cannot be true one to another! Henry IV,Part I[II,2] Serap Magill & Shahin Khalilli 30 Some claim that Prince Henry was using Falstaff and his gang to gain experience or education,which he could put to use at a later date when he gained the throne.As Prince Hal said:Would they were multitudes,and on my head My shames redoubled! for the time will come,That I shall make this northern youth exchange His glorious deeds for my indignities.(Henry IV III,ii)Critical comparisons Macbeth and Richard III Shakespeare wrote his King Richard III play around ten years earlier than when he wrote Macbeth.Accordingly,one is inclined to the supposition that Shakespeare modelled the character of Macbeth on some of the behavioural traits of King Richard III.The plays King Richard III and Macbeth*1both have characters,which are studies in evil.These characters happen to be the main characters in the plays and it is from the names of the main characters that the plays take their titles.Macbeth and King Richard III have in common a number of shared behavioural traits.Both characters committed regicide,they are both child killers and both violently removed any person who stood in the way of their ambition or their authority.Macbeth was the King of Scotland from 1040 – 1057 but his characterization fabricated by Shakespeare in the play of the same name was purely imaginary.Macbeth of Moray was a just ruler of Scotland.According to John Prebble,in his 1000 year history of Scotland,‘The Lion of The North’,‘Macbeth was a resolute,ambitious,and self-confidant man,untroubled by dreams or by the nagging of his wife’(17).According to Sir Edmund K.Chambers in his literary introduction to the Play ‘Macbeth’:‘His [Macbeth] reign was one of was of order and prosperity; his bounty to the church became famous in Scotland,and even in Rome’.(Chambers,The Warwick Shakespeare,p14)Macbeth did not murder King Duncan in his castle.Again according Chambers:* Note that Shakespeare’s play Macbeth is not one of the English History plays.Shakespeare’s English Historic Plays 31 ‘Macbeth made common cause with Thorfin of Norway and had Duncan murdered at Bothgounnan,‘the smith’s bothy’ and in his own right proclaimed himself King’.(Chambers,The Warwick Shakespeare,p14)If we accept Chambers,view of Macbeth then Macbeth did not commit the murder of Duncan but had the murder carried out by someone else.Macbeth’s foul deeds as described in the play Macbeth were products of Shakespeare’s imagination but Richard when he was Duke of Gloucester and later King Richard III of England apparently committed the foul deeds which Shakespeare writes about in the Henry IV and King Richard III plays.King Richard’s character as portrayed in Shakespeare’s first tetralogy of English history plays apparently accurately matches that of the real King Richard III.Shakespeare most probably took his references for the characte-rization of Richard from Holinshed’s English Chronicles.Holinshed apparently took his references on Richard III from Sir Thomas More’s unfinished ‘History of King Richard III’.**1 In More’s work Richard is described as a malevolent evil character:‘Richarde the third sonne,of whom we nowe entreate,was in witte and courage egall with either of them,in bodye and prowesse farre vnder them bot,little of stature,ill fetured of limmes,croke backed,his left shoulder much higher then his right,hard fauoured of visage,and suche as is in states called warlye,in other menne otherwise,he was malicious,wrathfull,enuious,and from afore his birth,euer frowarde.’ (Original English translation from Thomas More’s Latin.)Now a modern English translation … ‘Richard,the third son,of whom we now entreat,was in wit and courage equal with either of them; in body and prowess,far under them both; little of stature,ill-featured of limbs,crook-backed,his left shoulder much higher than his right,hard favoured of visage,and such as is in ** ‘in dealing with the reign of Richard III the work attributed to Sir Thomas More is treated in the same way.’ Churton Collins j.Studies in Shakespeare Ephemera Critica,E.P.Button & co New York,1904 Serap Magill & Shahin Khalilli 32 states called warly,in other men otherwise; he was malicious,wrathful,envious,and from before his birth ever froward.’ (Cayley Arthur,‘Memoirs of Sir Thomas More’,Cadell and Davis,Strand,London,1808.p.154)Thus,from Sir Thomas More we are given a very unflattering portrait of Richard when he was a young boy and later in the paragraph,we learn of Richard’s adult character:‘With large gifts he gat him unstedfast friendship,for which he was fain to pill and spoil in other places and get him stedfast hatred.He was close and secret,a deep dissembler,lowly of countenance,arrogant of heart,outwardly companionable where he inwardly hated,not letting to kiss whom he thought to kill; dispiteous and cruel,not for evil will alway,but after for ambition,and either for the surety or increase of his estate.Friend and foe was much what indifferent where his advantage grew; he spared no man's death whose life withstood his purpose.’ (Cayley,p 154 – 155)Note that some modern historians and academics refute the historic evidence against Richard III as an evil murderer.However,the actual truth of the historic facts is not something debated here.We are only interested in Shakespeare’s work and from where he took his information.Thus,the saintly Sir Thomas More,a respected chronicler and man of letters,has given us a detailed description of King Richard from his early youth to tyrant king.According to More,Richard would show his character and commit some dreadful acts of murder and execution,which we observe in Shakespeare’s Henry IV and ‘Richard III’ and plays.On Macbeth’s character we have very little history to guide us and certainly no detailed description such as that given by Thomas More of Richard III.However,we do know the Macbeth was a usurper and what is known about him is gleaned from the Holinshed Chronicles and from Wyntown’s ‘Cronhill’.Chambers presumes that Shakespeare must have had before him Holinshed and Wyntown as research materials when he wrote Macbeth(4).Shakespeare’s English Historic Plays 33 If we compare the behaviour of Macbeth and Richard III,as seen in Shakespeare’s plays,we can observe similarities in the murderous acts from both men.Macbeth Richard III Regicide:Macbeth murders King Duncan Regicide:Richard Duke of Gloucester murders King Henry IV hires murderers:Murder of Banquo hires murderers:Murder of the Duke of Clarence hires murderers:Murder of Macduff’s children hires murderers:Murder of the little princes Regicide:Macbeth murders King Duncan Macbeth stabs Duncan to death whilst Duncan sleeps in his bed-chamber.This deed allows Macbeth to take the crown of Scotland Regicide:Richard Duke of Gloucester murders King Henry IV Richard murders Henry who is imprisoned in the tower of London.Thus Richard removes one obstacle to the crown of England in his quest to be king.Richard Duke of Gloucester hires murderers:Murder of the Duke of Clarence The Duke of Clarence is murdered by drowning in a vat of wine whilst he is imprisoned in the Tower of London.Thus,another obstacle is removed from Gloucester’s path to kingship.Macbeth hires murderers:Murder of Banquo Macbeth orders the murder of Banquo and his son to secure his position of King and to secure the regal succession for his family.Macbeth hires murderers:Murder of Macduff’s children Macduff’s wife and children are murdered in their castle to secure Macbeths lineage and because Macbeth has been told to fear Macduff.King Richard III hires murderers:Murder of the little princes King Richard III hires murderers to kill the two princes being held on Richard’s orders in the tower.The murder helps to secure Richards authority as prince Edward should be the rightful heir to the throne.Incidentally one wonders if the ‘All hail’ in the witches’ speeches in Macbeth:Serap Magill & Shahin Khalilli 34 First Witch.Banquo and Macbeth,all hail! (Act I.iii)is a direct reference back to the Duke of Gloucester in the King Richard III play.Richard Duke of Gloucester makes a reference to ‘All hail’ in an aside in the play Henry VI part 3:Duke of Gloucester.And,that I love the tree from whence thou sprang'st,Witness the loving kiss I give the fruit.[Aside] To say the truth,so Judas kiss'd his master,And cried 'all hail!’ when as he meant all harm.(Act V,vii)The prophecies which the witches addressed to Macbeth and Banquo appeared to be ‘good news’ for them,but as events unfold in the play we learn that the witches’ prophecies in reality bring murder and ruin.Is the witches ‘All hail’ in the Macbeth play Shakespeare’s reference back to Gloucester’s aside “'all hail!’ when as he meant all harm’?” 8.Character names in Shakespeare’s plays The names of the characters in Shakespeare’s plays sometimes appear to have different names,on the line entries on the play script,from those shown in the dramatis personae,especially in the English historic plays.Often the character names are abbreviated to save space on the play script or because a character is known by more than one name or a character’s title changes due to the circumstances given in the play.For instance in Shakespeare’s play Richard III the character King Richard III only appears in act IV,for the three previous acts the character was Richard then Richard Duke of Gloucester,in other words changed circumstances for the character caused a character name change.However the play script might just show ‘Richard’ or; ‘Rich.’ for the character’s lines entries in every act.Aristocratic families or landed gentry in England during the period of the English Historic plays often had two names,the family name and the title which they held.The title they held may have been conferred upon them by the king,or inherited,if the title was hereditary.Shakespeare’s English Historic Plays 35 For instance,Richard Neville,Earl of Warwick,most often referred to as ‘Warwick’ in the plays.The name ‘Warwick’ refers to the place where he was born and Neville is his family name.So we might read in the dramatis personae the name of the character as the ‘Earl of Warwick’ but the character may be referred to by other characters simply as ‘Warwick’,occasionally we might observe the family name being used.Take for example:Henry IV.O God! that one might read the book of fate,… 'Tis not ten years gone Since Richard and Northumberland,great friends,Did feast together,and in two years after Were they at wars.It is but eight years since This Percy was the man nearest my soul; Who like a brother toil'd in my affairs And laid his love and life under my foot; Yea,for my sake,even to the eyes of Richard Gave him defiance.But which of you was by— [To Warwick] You,cousin Nevil,as I may remember— When Richard,with his eye brim full of tears,In the above example of we can see that the ‘Earl of Warwick’ is referred to firstly as ‘Warwick’ then secondly as cousin ‘Nevil’,Nevil,being Warwick’s family name.Similarly the name Northumberland in the lines above is also known as Percy.The term cousin when used by aristocracy to one another was not a familial term but one of mutual respect,indicative of social rank but not necessarily of family ties.Other examples; Richard Scroop,The Archbishop of York,or simply York; Edmund Mortimer,5th Earl of March or simply Mortimer or March; Henry Tudor,Earl of Richmond,King Henry VII or simply Richmond in some places.Serap Magill & Shahin Khalilli 36 37 PART II:THE FIRST TETRALOGY OF ENGLISH HISTORIC PLAYS Serap

acts of this play are:in London the Temple Garden; The Tower of London; Parliament; the royal court and Westminster Abbey and in France in Paris; Bordeaux; Orleans; Rouen; Gascony and The Countess’ castle in Auvergne.Synopsis of the play Warner tells us in ‘English History in Shakespeare’s plays’,that the three pivots around which the discordant order of events revolve,are marked by three names:(I.)Joan of Arc,and the loss of the French conquests of Henry V (II.)Jack Cade,as one of the moving springs of civil dissension; and (III.)Warwick,the Kingmaker,the last of the great barons,who in his own powerful person revived for a time the fading glory of Feudalism,and with whose death at Barnet it expired forever.’ (Warner,1899,p.171)Act 1 In Westminster Abbey,Henry V’s funeral is in

Henry VI.Ungentle queen,to call him gentle Suffolk! No more,I say:if thou dost plead for him,Thou wilt but add increase unto my wrath.Had I but said,I would have kept my word,But when I swear,it is irrevocable.If,after three days’space,thou here be'st found On any ground that I am ruler of,The world shall not be ransom for thy life.Come,Warwick,come,good Warwick,go with me; I have great matters to impart to thee.The Cardinal passes away.Earl of Warwick.So bad a death argues a monstrous life.Henry VI.Forbear to judge,for we are sinners All.Close up his eyes and draw the curtain close; And let us all to meditation.Serap Magill & Shahin Khalilli 64 Act 4 Suffolk does not live long; whilst heading for France,pirates kill him because he made a joke King Henry,murdered Gloucester and lost Anjou and Maine.Earl of Suffolk.Come,soldiers,show what cruelty ye can,That this my death may never be forgot!

Why,then,I do but dream on sovereignty; Like one that stands upon a promontory,And spies a far-off shore where he would tread,… Why,I can smile,and murder whiles I smile,And cry 'Content’to that which grieves my heart,And wet my cheeks with artificial tears,And frame my face to all occasions.I'll drown more sailors than the mermaid shall; I'll slay more gazers than the basilisk; I'll play the orator as well as Nestor,Deceive more slily than Ulysses could,And,like a Sinon,take another Troy.I can add colours to the chameleon,Change shapes with Proteus for advantages,And set the murderous Machiavel to school.Can I do this,and cannot get a crown?

his epigrammatic play of words and ideas,his grace and dignity of dialogue; his psychological curiosity his metaphorical prodigality; his disclosed fruits of pensive experience; his encased kernels of consolidated thought,his touches of human nature,here finely caught,there mysteriously inspired,his world-wide illustration; his magical imagery of outward things reflected from the innermost sense of them,all involved in a stream of melody whose onflow becomes in itself pathetic,--of these from the three parts of Henry the Sixth I still miss some sensible measure.Vaughan Henry Halford,1880,New Readings and New Renderings of Shakespeare’s Tragedies,vol.II,p.v.Setting The play Richard III takes place in late 15th century England,mostly in London,on anonymous streets,in non-specific rooms of the royal palace at Westminster,one brief scene at Pomfret Castle,one scene in Salisbury,Richmond’s camp of Tamworth and at Bosworth field.Synopsis of the play Three great historical events marked in the drama.(I.)The death of Edward IV.(II.)Richard’s successful usurpation of the throne.(III.)Bosworth Field and Richmond.(Warner,1899,p.208)Shakespeare’s English Historic Plays 81 Act 1 Richard Duke of Gloucester,opens the play by declaring all in England is well,except with himself and gives us a good description of his personality and his wretched body.Further Gloucester let’s us know of his murderous character and ambition.Duke of Gloucester.… But I,that am not shaped for sportive tricks,Nor made to court an amorous looking-glass; I,that am rudely stamp’d,and want love’s majesty To strut before a wanton ambling nymph; I,that am curtail’d of this fair proportion,Cheated of feature by dissembling nature,Deformed,unfinish’d,sent before my time Into this breathing world,scarce half made up,And that so lamely and unfashionable That dogs bark at me as I halt by them; Why,I,in this weak piping time of peace,Have no delight to pass away the time,Unless to spy my shadow in the sun And descant on mine own deformity:And therefore,since I cannot prove a lover,To entertain these fair well-spoken days,I am determined to prove a villain And hate the idle pleasures of these days.Plots have I laid,inductions dangerous,By drunken prophecies,libels and dreams,To set my brother Clarence and the king In deadly hate the one against the other:And if King Edward be as true and just As I am subtle,false and treacherous,This day should Clarence closely be mew’d up,About a prophecy,which says that ‘G’ Of Edward’s heirs the murderer shall be.Dive,thoughts,down to my soul:here Clarence comes.To fulfil the prophecy The Duke of Gloucester convinces King Edward IV to send his brother Clarence to the Tower because the Duke of Gloucester’s first name George starts with ‘G’.George.Serap Magill & Shahin Khalilli 82 George Plantagenet (Duke of Clarence).His majesty Tendering my person's safety,hath appointed This conduct to convey me to the Tower.Duke of Gloucester.Upon what cause?

Furnivall,Frederick James 1877,ed.The Leopold Shakspere.If Shakespeare’s fondness for the ludicrous sometimes led to faults in his tragedies (which was not often the case),he has made us amends by the character of Falstaff.This is perhaps the most substantial comic character that ever was invented.Characters of Shakespeare’s Plays William Hazlitt Note:It is now generally accepted that Shakespeare originally named Falstaff “Sir John Oldcastle”,and that the Baron Cobham,a descendant of the historical Sir John Oldcastle,complained and forced Shakespeare to change the name(8).Setting The setting for the play is England.There are seven scenes in London and seven scenes in Shrewsbury.There are also two scenes in Rochester and one each in York,Wales,and Warkworth Castle in Northumberland.Synopsis of the play Prince Hal and Hotspur One of the main themes of the Henry IV play is the development of the character of Price Hal from a wastrel who frequents inns and keeps bad company to that of a mature young man who can command respect and rule a country.Shakespeare’s English Historic Plays 107 Hal’s father King Henry IV is very worried about his son and compares his idle behaviour unfavourably with that of Hotspur one of the Percy family.Act 1 King Henry IV holds a conference with his advisory council.His preparations for a holy crusade are postponed because England’s borders are threatened.Henry IV.It seems then that the tidings of this broil Brake off our business for the Holy Land.The English general Mortimer is taken prisoner by the Welshman Glendower when he lost a battle in Wales.Another English lord,Hotspur,who had recently won a battle in the north against the Scottish leader Douglas,refused to send the king the prisoners he captured.King Henry was very angry with Hotspur and summoned him to court.Henry IV.Send me your prisoners with the speediest means,Or you shall hear in such a kind from me As will displease you.My Lord Northumberland,We licence your departure with your son.Send us your prisoners,or you will hear of it.Henry’s son,Prince Hal,who should be helping his father govern the country is somewhere in London roistering with his old friend,the disreputable Sir John Falstaff.A young thief named Poins meets them,and makes plans for a highway robbery along with Falstaff at Gad’s Hill.Edward Poins.But,my lads,my lads,to-morrow morning,by four o’clock,early at Gadshill! there are pilgrims going to Canterbury with rich offerings,and traders riding to London with fat purses:I have vizards for you all; you have horses for yourselves:Hal refuses to join them until Poins tempts Hal with a plan to play a practical joke on Falstaff,which will show Falstaff as a coward.In the palace Hotspur,Northumberland,and Worcester argue with King Henry.The Percy family,powerful northern lords are plotting to Serap Magill & Shahin Khalilli 108 rebel against Henry.They intend to enlist Henry’s enemies Glendower,Mortimer,Douglas,and the Archbishop of York to help them overthrow the king.Hotspur (Henry Percy).Why,it cannot choose but be a noble plot; And then the power of Scotland and of York,To join with Mortimer,ha? Act 2 Two carriers discuss the condition of England.A member of Poins’ gang finds out when several rich merchants will be passing Gad’s Hill on their way to London.Falstaff and the band of thieves meet with Hal and Poins at Gad’s Hill and rob the passing merchants; then Hal and Poins,in disguise,steal the stolen money.Falstaff defends himself briefly and unsuccessfully.Hal and Poins take the stolen money to London.At Warkworth Castle in the north,Hotspur receives a letter from a lord who refuses to join the rebellion conspiracy and rides off to meet the rebel leaders in Wales.In a London tavern Hal and Poins wait for Falstaff to arrive.Falstaff and the thieves burst into the tavern,and tell an exaggerated story about their encounter with an army of thieves at Gad’s Hill.Hal exposes Falstaff as a liar.Then news of the Percy rebellion reaches the tavern.Hal,summoned to court,prepares for inevitable scolding from his father’s by rehearsing with Falstaff the meeting with Henry.At the height of their play-acted argument,a sheriff arrives to arrest Falstaff for theft.Falstaff hides and Hal lies to protect him from criminal punishment.Falstaff falls asleep,and Hal picks his pocket before returning to court.Henry V.O,if it should,how would thy guts fall about thy knees! But,sirrah,there's no room for faith,truth,nor honesty in this bosom of thine; it is all filled up with guts and midriff.Charge an honest woman with picking thy pocket! why,thou whoreson,impudent,embossed rascal,if there were anything in thy pocket but tavern-reckonings,memorandums of bawdy-houses,and one poor penny-worth of sugar-candy to make thee long-winded,if thy pocket Shakespeare’s English Historic Plays 109 were enriched with any other injuries but these,I am a villain:and yet you will stand to if; you will not pocket up wrong:art thou not ashamed? Act 3 In a castle in Wales,the rebels meet to divide the leadership of England into three parts.Mortimer.The archdeacon hath divided it Into three limits very equally:England,from Trent and Severn hitherto,By south and east is to my part assign’d:All westward,Wales beyond the Severn shore,And all the fertile land within that bound,To Owen Glendower:and,dear coz,to you The remnant northward,lying off from Trent.And our indentures tripartite are drawn; Which being sealed interchangeably,A business that this night may execute,To-morrow,cousin Percy,you and I And my good Lord of Worcester will set forth To meet your father and the Scottish power,As is appointed us,at Shrewsbury.My father Glendower is not ready yet,Not shall we need his help these fourteen days.Within that space you may have drawn together Your tenants,friends and neighbouring gentlemen.Glendower and Hotspur quarrel,but peace settles among the rebels while they say good-bye to their wives.They ride to Shrewsbury,where the battle against Henry takes place.In the palace Henry accuses Hal of wasting his youth and disappointing his family.Henry compares Hal unfavourably with King Richard II and Hotspur.Henry IV.… Tell me else,Could such inordinate and low desires,Such poor,such bare,such lewd,such mean attempts,Such barren pleasures,rude society,As thou art match’d withal and grafted to,Serap Magill & Shahin Khalilli 110 Accompany the greatness of thy blood And hold their level with thy princely heart? Hal promises to turn over a new leaf,Henry V.I shall hereafter,my thrice gracious lord,Be more myself.Hal vows to gain honour equal to Hotspur’s by fighting a glorious battle.Father and son are reconciled,and Henry gives his son command of one-third of the royal army.Henry IV.… Harry,you shall march Through Gloucestershire; by which account,Our business valued,some twelve days hence Our general forces at Bridgenorth shall meet.Our hands are full of business:let’s away; Advantage feeds him fat,while men delay.In the tavern Falstaff quarrels with the hostess over who picked his pocket.Falstaff.God-a-mercy! so should I be sure to be heart-burned.How now,Dame Partlet the hen! have you inquired yet who picked my pocket? Hostess Quickly.Why,Sir John,what do you think,Sir John? do you think I keep thieves in my house? I have searched,I have inquired,so has my husband,man by man,boy by boy,servant by servant:the tithe of a hair was never lost in my house before.Hal arrives at the tavern dressed for battle,and settles the quarrel between Falstaff and Quickly by admitting that he picked Falstaff’s pocket.Hal gives Falstaff command of a troop of foot soldiers,and returns to court to help with battle preparations.Falstaff plots ways gaining personal profit from the war.Shakespeare’s English Historic Plays 111 Act 4 Hotspur,Worcester and Douglas camp at Shrewsbury and wait for their allies.A messenger arrives with news that Northumberland and Glendower will not join them.Messenger.These letters come from your father.Hotspur (Henry Percy).Letters from him! why comes he not himself? Messenger.He cannot come,my lord; he is grievous sick.Hotspur (Henry Percy).'Zounds! how has he the leisure to be sick,In such a rustling time? Who leads his power? Under whose government come they along? Despite greatly reduced forces,Hotspur and Douglas resolve to continue.Vernon brings him news of the army he will meet in battle:Hotspur (Henry Percy).My cousin Vernon,welcome,by my soul.Vernon.Pray God my news be worth a welcome,lord.The Earl of Westmoreland,seven thousand strong,Is marching hitherwards; with him Prince John.Hotspur vows to kill Hal in single combat when he hears that Prince Hal is leading a gloriously army toward Shrewsbury.Hotspur (Henry Percy).No more,no more:worse than the sun in March,This praise doth nourish agues.Let them come:… Who is to bear me like a thunderbolt Against the bosom of the Prince of Wales:Harry to Harry shall,hot horse to horse,Meet and ne'er part till one drop down a corse.O that Glendower were come! As Falstaff leads his ragged foot soldiers toward the battlefield,Hal is shocked by their appearance.Henry V.I think,to steal cream indeed,for thy theft hath already made thee butter.But tell me,Jack,whose fellows are these that come after? Falstaff.Mine,Hal,mine.Henry V.I did never see such pitiful rascals.Falstaff.Tut,tut; good enough to toss; food for powder,food for powder; they'll fill a pit as well as better:Serap Magill & Shahin Khalilli 112 tush,man,mortal men,mortal men.Earl of Westmoreland.Ay,but,Sir John,methinks they are exceeding poor and bare,too beggarly.Falstaff.'Faith,for their poverty,I know not where they had that; and for their bareness,I am sure they never learned that of me.Henry V.No I'll be sworn; unless you call three fingers on the ribs bare.But,sirrah,make haste:Percy is already in the field.Sir Walter Blunt takes an offer of pardon from Henry to the rebel camp.Blunt.I come with gracious offers from the king,if you vouchsafe me hearing and respect.Hotspur (Henry Percy).Welcome,Sir Walter Blunt; and would to God You were of our determination! Some of us love you well; and even those some Envy your great deservings and good name,Because you are not of our quality,But stand against us like an enemy.Hotspur airs his grievances against Henry’s rule,and sends Blunt back to the royal camp without an answer.At York,the archbishop is very worried because the king’s army outnumbers the rebels three to one.Archbishop Scroop.And so there is:but yet the king hath drawn The special head of all the land together:The Prince of Wales,Lord John of Lancaster,The noble Westmoreland and warlike Blunt; And more corrivals and dear men Of estimation and command in arms.Sir Michael.Doubt not,my lord,they shall be well opposed.Archbishop Scroop.I hope no less,yet needful 'tis to fear; And,to prevent the worst,Sir Michael,speed:For if Lord Percy thrive not,ere the king Dismiss his power,he means to visit us,For he hath heard of our confederacy,And 'tis but wisdom to make strong against him:Therefore make haste.I must go write again To other friends; and so farewell,Sir Michael.Shakespeare’s English Historic Plays 113 Act 5 Worcester and Henry try to reach a peaceful settlement,and Hal intervenes to offer himself in single combat against Hotspur rather than have a battle.Henry V.… For my part,I may speak it to my shame,I have a truant been to chivalry; And so I hear he doth account me too; Yet this before my father’s majesty— I am content that he shall take the odds Of his great name and estimation,And will,to save the blood on either side,Try fortune with him in a single fight.Henry forbids a single combat between Hal and Hotspur and sends Worcester back to the rebel camp with an ultimatum.Henry IV.… No,good Worcester,no,We love our people well; even those we love That are misled upon your cousin’s part; And,will they take the offer of our grace,Both he and they and you,every man Shall be my friend again and I’ll be his:So tell your cousin,and bring me word What he will do:but if he will not yield,Rebuke and dread correction wait on us And they shall do their office.So,be gone; We will not now be troubled with reply:We offer fair; take it advisedly.Worcester lies to Hotspur about Henry’s peace offer,and the battle challenge is given.During the battle Henry fights Douglas,and Hal fights Hotspur.Hal rescues Henry from Douglas,and kills Hotspur.Earl of Douglas.Another king! they grow like Hydra's heads:I am the Douglas,fatal to all those That wear those colours on them:what art thou,That counterfeit'st the person of a king? Henry IV.The king himself; who,Douglas,grieves at heart So many of his shadows thou hast met And not the very king.I have two boys Serap Magill & Shahin Khalilli 114 Seek Percy and thyself about the field:But,seeing thou fall'st on me so luckily,I will assay thee:so,defend thyself.Earl of Douglas.I fear thou art another counterfeit; And yet,in faith,thou bear'st thee like a king:But mine I am sure thou art,whoe'er thou be,And thus I win thee.[They fight.King Henry being in danger,Prince Henry enters] Henry V.Hold up thy head,vile Scot,or thou art like Never to hold it up again! the spirits Of valiant Shirley,Stafford,Blunt,are in my arms:It is the Prince of Wales that threatens thee; Who never promiseth but he means to pay.[They fight:Douglas flies] Cheerly,my lord.how fares your grace? Sir Nicholas Gawsey hath for succor sent,And so hath Clifton:I'll to Clifton straight.Falstaff,meanwhile,leads his soldiers into the thickest fighting and spurns honour when he feigns death when challenged by Douglas.Standing between the bodies of Hotspur,his greatest rival,and his best friend Falstaff,Hal praises Hotspur and teases Falstaff,then walks away.Falstaff jumps up and defends his apparent cowardly behaviour.When Hal returns he is amazed to find Falstaff alive.Hal allows Falstaff to take credit for killing Hotspur,a lie on which Falstaff stakes his future reputation.The king’s army wins the battle and Henry orders the executions of the rebel prisoners,but Hal insists on freeing Douglas.Henry divides the royal army,proudly giving his son command of one-half.The two halves split to the north and west,marching away to fight the remaining rebel leaders.Henry IV.Then this remains,that we divide our power.You,son John,and my cousin Westmoreland Towards York shall bend you with your dearest speed,To meet Northumberland and the prelate Scroop,Who,as we hear,are busily in arms:Myself and you,son Harry,will towards Wales,To fight with Glendower and the Earl of March.Rebellion in this land shall lose his sway,Meeting the cheque of such another day:And since this business so fair is done,Let us not leave till all our own be won.Shakespeare’s English Historic Plays 115 15.Henry IV Part 2 Dramatis Personae:King Henry IV of England retainers Morton and Travers Henry V,Prince,King of England Sir John Falstaff,Bardolph,Pistol,Page Duke of Clarence Poins,Peto Prince John of Lancaster Shallow and Silence Justices Prince Humphrey of Gloucester Davy,servant to Shallow Earl of Warwick Mouldy,Wart,shadow,feeble,Bullcalf Earl of Westmoreland Fang and Snare Sheriff’s officers Earl of Surry Rumour,the Presenter Gower,Harcourt Porter Lord Chief Justice Dancer,speaks the Epilogue Earl of Northumberland Lady Northumberland Scroop,Archbishop of York Lady Percy Lord Mowbray Hostess Quickly Lord Hastings Doll Tearsheet Lord Bardolph Lords,attendants,officers,soldiers Sir John Colville Messengers,drawers,beadles,grooms Introduction I fancy every reader,when he ends this play,cries out with Desdemona,“O most lame and impotent conclusion!” None of Shakespeare’s plays are more read than the First and Second Parts of Henry the Fourth.Perhaps no author has ever in two plays afforded so much delight.The great events are interesting,for the fate of kingdoms depends upon them,the slighter occurrences are diverting,and except one or two,sufficiently probable the incidents are multiplied with wonderful fertility of invention,and the characters diversified with the utmost nicety of discernment,and the profoundest skill in the nature of man.Johnson,Samuel 1768,General Observations on Shakespeare’s Plays.Setting The setting of the acts of this play are; Northumberland’s Castle,a London street,the Archbishop of York’s palace,Westminster palace,Gloucestershire and Yorkshire.Serap Magill & Shahin Khalilli 116 Synopsis of the play Act 1 Lord Bardolph delivers a glowing report of victory to the supposedly ailing Northumberland.Lord Bardolph.Noble Earl,I bring you certain news from Shrewsbury.… As good as heart can wish.The King is almost wounded to the death; And,in the fortune of my lord your son,Prince Harry slain outright; and both the Blunts Kill’d by the hand of Douglas; young Prince John,And Westmoreland,and Stafford,fled the field; And Harry Monmouth’s brawn,the hulk Sir John,Is prisoner to your son.O,such a day,So fought,so followed,and so fairly won,Came not till now to dignify the times,Since Cesar’s fortunes! The Archbishop of York,backed by his political and religious authority,is gathering troops to rebel and justifying it by Richard II’s unjust usurpation.Northumberland sends out letters to plan revenge.Earl of Northumberland.I knew of this before; but,to speak truth,This present grief had wip’d it from my mind.Go in with me; and counsel every man The aptest way for safety and revenge.Get posts and letters,and make friends with speed— Never so few,and never yet more need.[Exeunt] In a street in London Falstaff meets with his Page later the Chief Justice arrives.He previously had Hal placed in prison for striking him in the ear.He now wants to question Falstaff about a robbery,but Falstaff cleverly dodges the questions and talks of his upcoming expedition.He says Falstaff lives in infamy and has misled the young prince,behaving like an ill angel.Falstaff’s recent service has helped to offset the robbery he committed at Gad’s Hill.He informs him that the king has severed him from Hal.He is glad to have Falstaff going away on the expedition,but refuses to lend him any money.Shakespeare’s English Historic Plays 117 Falstaff is left lamenting how he can not borrow enough money to meet his needs,and sends his page with letters of solicitation to John,Hal,Westmorland,and Mistress Ursula,whom he has promised repeatedly to marry.He is bothered with gout but plans to convert his diseases to commodity.Archbishop Scroop meets with Lord Mowbray,Lord Hastings,and Lord Bardolph.Archbishop Scroop.Thus have you heard our cause and known our means; And,my most noble friends,I pray you all Speak plainly your opinions of our hopes-And first,Lord Marshal,what say you to it? Lord Mowbray.I well allow the occasion of our amis; But gladly would be better satisfied How,in our means,we should advance ourselves To look with forehead bold and big enough Upon the power and puissance of the King.Lord Hastings.Our present musters grow upon the file To five and twenty thousand men of choice; And our supplies live largely in the hope Of great Northumberland,whose bosom burns With an incensed fire of injuries.Lord Bardolph.The question then,Lord Hastings,standeth thus:Whether our present five and twenty thousand May hold up head without Northumberland? Lord Bardolph advises waiting for Northumberland.Lord Bardolph.Yea,marry,there's the point; But if without him we be thought too feeble,My judgment is we should not step too far Till we had his assistance by the hand; For,in a theme so bloody-fac'd as this,Conjecture,expectation,and surmise Of aids incertain,should not be admitted.Hotspur had counted on his support at Shrewsbury and it never came.Bardolph wants them to revise their plans accordingly.Hastings thinks they have enough forces without Northumberland as the king’s forces are divided between England,Wales,and France.Lord Hastings.Grant that our hopes—yet likely of fair birth— Should be still-born,and that we now possess'd Serap Magill & Shahin Khalilli 118 The utmost man of expectation,I think we are so a body strong enough,Even as we are,to equal with the King.Archbishop wants the war to proceed and speaks against the changeable people,who wanted rid Richard and now want rid of Henry IV.Act 2 In a street in London Fang and Snare attempt to arrest Falstaff,but he throws them off and says to throw miss Quickly in the channel.Fang.Sir John,I arrest you at the suit of Mistress Quickly.Falstaff.Away,varlets! Draw,Bardolph.Cut me off the head.Throw the quean in the channel.Hostess Quickly.Throw me in the channel! I'll throw thee in the Wilt thou? wilt thou? thou bastardly rogue! Murder,murder! thou honeysuckle villain! wilt thou kill God's officers and King's? Ah,thou honey-seed rogue! thou art a honey-seed; a man-queller and a woman-queller.The Chief Justice arrives,and wonders why Falstaff is not already on his way to York.Quickly explains her plight as a poor widow of Eastcheap,and how Falstaff has taken advantage of her.She says he has promised to marry her and borrowed much money,but he denies the former and refuses to be the Chief Justice’s suitor.Gower arrives with a letter to the Chief Justice.Gower.The King,my lord,and Harry Prince of Wales Are near at hand.The rest the paper tells.[Gives a letter] Gower tells the Chief Justice about the movement of the king’s forces toward York,and the chief Justice ignores Falstaff.Falstaff returns the discourtesy by ignoring Chief Justice as he speaks to Gower.Lord Chief Justice.Where lay the King to-night? Gower.At Basingstoke,my lord.Falstaff.I hope,my lord,all's well.What is the news,my Lord Chief Justice.Come all his forces back? Gower.No; fifteen hundred foot,five hundred horse,Are march'd up to my Lord of Lancaster,Against Northumberland and the Archbishop.Falstaff.Comes the King back from Wales,my noble lord? Shakespeare’s English Historic Plays 119 Lord Chief Justice.You shall have letters of me presently.Come,go along with me,good Master Gower.Falstaff.My lord! Lord Chief Justice.What's the matter? Falstaff.Master Gower,shall I entreat you with me to dinner? Gower.I must wait upon my good lord here,I thank you,good John.Lord Chief Justice.Sir John,you loiter here too long,being you take soldiers up in counties as you go.Falstaff.Will you sup with me,Master Gower? Lord Chief Justice.What foolish master taught you these manners,John? Falstaff.Master Gower,if they become me not,he was a fool taught them me.This is the right fencing grace,my lord; tap tap,and so part fair.Lord Chief Justice.Now,the Lord lighten thee! Thou art a great fool [Exeunt] Hal’s father is sick,but he feels he cannot show his concern in the company of one so engrafted to Falstaff as Poins.Bardolph delivers a letter to Prince.In it he warns Prince to be careful about Poins that he is trying to get Prince to marry Poins’ sister.Falstaff is dining at the tavern with Doll and Quickly.Prince suggests he and Poins play another prank on Falstaff,in which they will dress as tavern drawers and wait on him.Lady Northumberland advises Northumberland to go Scotland until the assembled forces have had a taste of fighting,and Lady Percy adds that if they seem to be succeeding,then he can join in.Lady Northumberland.O,fly to Scotland Till that the nobles and the armed commons Have of their puissance made a little taste.He finally relents and decides to go to Scotland until the proper opportunity presents.Earl of Northumberland.Come,come,go in with me.'Tis with my mind As with the tide swell'd up unto his height,That makes a still-stand,running neither way.Fain would I go to meet the Archbishop,But many thousand reasons hold me back.I will resolve for Scotland.There am I,Till time and vantage crave my company.Serap Magill & Shahin Khalilli 120 At the Boar’s Head Tavern in Eastcheap Falstaff arrives singing.Falstaff claims Pistol to be his “ancient”,i.e.,his ensign or standard bearer,saying he is no swaggerer,but merely a gentle and tame cheater.Hostess is satisfied as long as he is not a swaggerer and Ancient Pistol is admitted along with Bardolph and Page.Pistol claims to know her,but she heaps further abuse on him and his pretensions of being a captain.Pistol wants vengeance on Doll.He invokes his trusty sword,Hiren,and,as Captain Pistol,pretentiously enacts lines and actions reminiscent of Marlowe’s “Tamburlaine”,Peele’s “The Turkish Mahomet and Hiren the Fair Greek”,“The Battle of Alcazar”,and other contemporary plays.He quotes ersatz Italian/Spanish “Si fortune me tormente,sperato me contento” and suggests he and Doll have enjoyed a night of bliss before.Falstaff wants him taken back downstairs,but Pistol draws his sword,quoting more poetry.Falstaff draws his rapier and fights Pistol,driving Pistol out,evoking Doll’s greater admiration and desire.At Wentworth castle the Duke of Northumberland and Lady Northumberland discuss the coming rebellion.Lady Northumberland advises her husband to go to Scotland and stay out of trouble.Lady Northumberland.O,fly to Scotland Till that the nobles and the armed commons Have of their puissance made a little taste.Lady Percy advises Northumberland to wait and see what the outcome of any battle might be.If the Mowbray and rebels win join them:Lady Percy.If they get ground and vantage of the King,Then join you with them,like a rib of steel,To make strength stronger; but,for all our loves,First let them try themselves.So did your son; He was so suff'red; so came I a widow; And never shall have length of life enough To rain upon remembrance with mine eyes,That it may grow and sprout as high as heaven,For recordation to my noble husband.Northumberland decides to take the advice of the ladies and flees to Scotland.Earl of Northumberland.Come,come,go in with me.'Tis with my mind Shakespeare’s English Historic Plays 121 As with the tide swell'd up unto his height,That makes a still-stand,running neither way.Fain would I go to meet the Archbishop,But many thousand reasons hold me back.I will resolve for Scotland.There am I,Till time and vantage crave my company.In Eastcheap the Prince and Poins arrive disguised as drawers.Doll asks Falstaff about the Prince and Falstaff claims the Prince would make a good pantler.Falstaff claims Poins lacks wit,and goes on to provide comical reasons why the two like each other.Prince and Poins respond to his request for sack with “anon,anon” and Falstaff recognizes them at last.Hostess welcomes them back to London.Prince berates him for what he said about him earlier in front of the “virtuous” Doll.The quick thinking Falstaff claims to have disparaged the Prince to Doll to keep her from falling in love with him,thereby protecting him.Prince challenges his contention that Doll is wicked,and Falstaff says Doll is in Hell already,and implies Hostess is guilty of allowing prostitution in her tavern.Peto enters,saying the king is at Westminster.Prince leaves with Poins and Peto.Bardolph responds to more knocking,telling Falstaff a dozen captains are there to take him to court.Falstaff leaves with Bardolph and Page.Act 3 Surrey and Warwick arrive at the palace of Westminster with Blunt,and reassure the king about the rebellion,suggesting it is like a disease to be cured with a little medicine.Henry IV.Why then,good morrow to you all,my lords.Have you read o'er the letters that I sent you? Earl of Warwick.We have,my liege.Henry IV.Then you perceive the body of our kingdom How foul it is; what rank diseases grow,And with what danger,near the heart of it.Earl of Warwick.It is but as a body yet distempered; Which to his former strength may be restored With good advice and little medicine.My Lord Northumberland will soon be cool'd.Serap Magill & Shahin Khalilli 122 The king is worried about what fate lies ahead.He recounts how Northumberland and Richard II were great friends,and then were at war with each other.Henry IV.O God! that one might read the book of fate,… 'Tis not ten years gone Since Richard and Northumberland,great friends,Did feast together,and in two years after Were they at wars.It is but eight years since This Percy was the man nearest my soul; Who like a brother toil'd in my affairs And laid his love and life under my foot; Yea,for my sake,even to the eyes of Richard Gave him defiance.But which of you was by— [To Warwick] You,cousin Nevil,as I may remember— When Richard,with his eye brim full of tears,He recalls Richard’s prophecies that Northumberland would be the ladder by which Henry IV would become king,and that the foul sin “shall break into corruption”,i.e.,that Henry IV in turn would be betrayed.Henry IV.Then check'd and rated by Northumberland,Did speak these words,now prov'd a prophecy? 'Northumberland,thou ladder by the which My cousin Bolingbroke ascends my throne'— Though then,God knows,I had no such intent But that necessity so bow'd the state That I and greatness were compell'd to kiss— 'The time shall come'—thus did he follow it— 'The time will come that foul sin,gathering head,Shall break into corruption’so went on,Foretelling this same time's condition And the division of our amity.Henry IV has heard a rumour that Archbishop and Northumberland are 50,000 strong,but Warwick assures him it is a rumour,and moreover that Glendower is dead.Henry IV.Are these things then necessities? Then let us meet them like necessities; And that same word even now cries out on us.They say the Bishop and Northumberland Are fifty thousand strong.Shakespeare’s English Historic Plays 123 In Justice,Shallow’s house in Gloucestershire Shallow and Silence converse about his cousin Silence’s daughter Ellen,and another cousin William.William is at Oxford and preparing for a career in law.They reminisce about their allegedly lusty swashbuckling student days in Oxford and at the Inns O’Court.Bardolph arrives ahead of Falstaff who is coming for recruits for the army.Falstaff enters,exchanges greetings,and asks to see the potential recruits.Left alone,Bullcalf and Moldy bribe Bardolph to stay behind.Feeble remains willing to go to war,saying we owe God a death.Falstaff and the Justices return.Bardolph privately advises him of the bribe and Falstaff dismisses Bullcalf and Moldy over Shallow’s objections.Falstaff explains his comical methods of selection for Wart,Shadow,and Feeble.He has Bardolph put the recruits through their manoeuvres.As Falstaff leaves and vows that he will get the better of the lying old Justices.He then vehemently berates Justice Swallow.Act 4 Archbishop Scroop tells Hastings and Mowbray that he has a letter from Northumberland saying he is in Scotland.Mowbray knows their hopes are dashed.Archbishop Scroop.'Tis well done.… I have receiv'd New-dated letters from Northumberland; Their cold intent,tenour,and substance,thus:Here doth he wish his person,with such powers As might hold sortance with his quality,The which he could not levy; whereupon He is retir'd,to ripe his growing fortunes,To Scotland; and concludes in hearty prayers That your attempts may overlive the hazard And fearful meeting of their opposite.A messenger tells them that the enemy is one mile off.Messenger.West of this forest,scarcely off a mile,In goodly form comes on the enemy; And,by the ground they hide,I judge their number Upon or near the rate of thirty thousand.On the battlefield Westmorland arrives for a parley and asks why the Archbishop has left his religious duties to join this rebellion.Serap Magill & Shahin Khalilli 124 The Archbishop answers:Archbishop Scroop.Wherefore do I this? So the question stands.Briefly to this end:we are all diseas'd And with our surfeiting and wanton hours Have brought ourselves into a burning fever,And we must bleed for it; of which disease Our late King,Richard,being infected,died.He recounts that they have been denied access to the king and alludes to the unjust execution of his brother Stephen Scroop at Bristol by Henry IV.Lord Mowbray similarly states complaints.Westmorland argues that it was the times,not the king,responsible for his father’s death that he has been restored to his father’s previous titles and properties,and that his father was hated at the time Bolingbroke,Henry IV,challenged him.Earl of Westmoreland.O my good Lord Mowbray,Construe the times to their necessities,And you shall say,indeed,it is the time,And not the King,that doth you injuries.Yet,for your part,it not appears to me,Either from the King or in the present time,That you should have an inch of any ground To build a grief on.Were you not restor'd To all the Duke of Norfolk's signiories,Your noble and right well-rememb'red father's? Westmoreland offers to the rebels the right to a hearing with the king and claims that their just demands will be met,saying this offer comes from mercy,not fear.Mowbray is suspicious of the offer and wants to reject it,but Westmorland says to decline to parley reflects shame on their part.Hastings wants to know if Prince John has full power to represent the king,and Westmorland answers he does.Archbishop Scroop hands Westmorland a schedule of grievances and agrees they will meet between the battle lines.Archbishop Scroop.Then take,my Lord of Westmoreland,this schedule,For this contains our general grievances.Shakespeare’s English Historic Plays 125 Each several article herein redress'd,All members of our cause,both here and hence,That are insinewed to this action,Acquitted by a true substantial form,And present execution of our wills To us and to our purposes confin'd-We come within our awful banks again,And knit our powers to the arm of peace.Westmorland leaves and Mowbray expresses suspicion that their conditions cannot possibly stand,that the king will always remember their rebellion.The Archbishop reassures him that the king is weary of strife and killing.Westmorland asks that the armies be dismissed and the King will redress the wrongs.Hasting has his army dispersed:Lord Hastings.My lord,our army is dispers'd already.Like youthful steers unyok'd,they take their courses East,west,north,south; or like a school broke up,Each hurries toward his home and sporting-place.However Westmorland’s army is still in the field and Westmorland arrests the rebels:Earl of Westmoreland.Good tidings,my Lord Hastings; for the which I do arrest thee,traitor,of high treason; And you,Lord Archbishop,and you,Lord Mowbray,Of capital treason I attach you both.Prince John greets them between the armies.He says the Archbishop served his flock better when he gave them sermons than as an “iron man” and rebel,suggesting he has misused the reverence of his position.But when prompted,John says that he likes the written articles that Archbishop has sent to him and swears on his honour to allow them and redress them all.He asks that both sides discharge their armies and make peace,and the Archbishop takes him at his word.They embrace and drink together,except Mowbray who feels ill.The peace is announced and Prince John instructs Westmorland to dismiss his army whereupon Westmorland arrests the Archbishop and Mowbray for treason.Serap Magill & Shahin Khalilli 126 Earl of Westmoreland.Good tidings,my Lord Hastings; for the which I do arrest thee,traitor,of high treason; And you,Lord Archbishop,and you,Lord Mowbray,Of capital treason I attach you both.Mowbray asks if that was honourable and Westmorland asks if their rebellion was honourable.Prince John sends the traitors to be executed.On the battlefield Falstaff encounters Sir John Coleville and proposes to arrest him.Prince John,Westmorland arrive and Prince John wants to know why Falstaff has taken so long to arrive.Falstaff protests he moves slowly,but proudly presents Coleville,whom he has captured and hopes he will be recognized for this act in a ballad or in the history chronicles.Prince John questions Coleville:Prince John.Is thy name Colville? Sir John Colville.It is,my lord.Prince John.A famous rebel art thou,Colville.Falstaff.And a famous true subject took him.Sir John Colville.I am,my lord,but as my betters are That led me hither.Had they been rul'd by me,You should have won them dearer than you have.Prince John sends Coleville with Blunt to join the other rebels for execution.John has heard the king is very sick and sends Westmorland on to the king with the news of their victory.Prince John.Send Colville,with his confederates,To York,to present execution.Blunt,lead him hence; and see you guard him sure.[Exeunt Blunt and others] And now dispatch we toward the court,my lords.I hear the King my father is sore sick.Our news shall go before us to his Majesty,Which,cousin,you shall bear to comfort him And we with sober speed will follow you.Falstaff asks leave to go through Gloucestershire on his way back to London.Left alone,he soliloquizes on the sober-blooded John and how he never laughs.Falstaff extols the virtues of a good sherris sack how it improves the brain,warms the blood,and illuminates the face.He thinks of Hal and the need to addict all sons to sack.Shakespeare’s English Historic Plays 127 In the Jerusalem Chamber in Westminster King Henry asks Humphrey Duke of Gloucester the whereabouts of Prince Henry and is told he is hunting.Henry IV.Humphrey,my son of Gloucester,Where is the Prince your brother? I think he's gone to hunt,my lord,at Henry IV.And how accompanied? Prince Humphrey.I do not know,my lord.Henry IV.Is not his brother,Thomas of Clarence,with him? King Henry tells Clarence to stay closer to Prince and observe him and stay in his good graces,all of which Clarence promises.He then reflects on Hal’s characteristics and temper.Henry IV says Prince is like a soil overspread with weeds and expresses concern that Prince courts danger and ruin.Henry IV.Most subject is the fattest soil to weeds; And he,the noble image of my youth,Is overspread with them; therefore my grief Stretches itself beyond the hour of death.The blood weeps from my heart when I do shape,In forms imaginary,th'unguided days And rotten times that you shall look upon When I am sleeping with my ancestors.For when his headstrong riot hath no curb,When rage and hot blood are his counsellors When means and lavish manners meet together,O,with what wings shall his affections fly Towards fronting peril and oppos'd decay! Warwick comforts him,saying that Prince is merely studying his companions like a strange tongue,learning their language but not intending to use it for long.Earl of Warwick.My gracious lord,you look beyond him quite.The Prince but studies his companions Like a strange tongue,wherein,to gain the language,'Tis needful that the most immodest word Be look'd upon and learnt; which once attain'd,Your Highness knows,comes to no further use But to be known and hated.So,like gross terms,The Prince will,in the perfectness of time,Cast off his followers; and their memory Serap Magill & Shahin Khalilli 128 Shall as a pattern or a measure live By which his Grace must mete the lives of other,Turning past evils to advantages.Westmorland arrives with news of the victory over the rebels.Earl of Westmoreland.Health to my sovereign,and new happiness,Added to that that am to deliver! Prince John,your son,doth kiss your Grace's hand.Mowbray,the Bishop Scroop,Hastings,and all,Are brought to the correction of your law.There is not now a rebel's sword unsheath'd,But Peace puts forth her olive everywhere.The manner how this action hath been borne Here at more leisure may your Highness read,With every course in his particular.Henry IV feels ill and Clarence and Gloucester recount recent ominous natural happenings and fear his end is near.Earl of Warwick.Speak lower,Princes,for the King recovers.Prince Humphrey.This apoplexy will certain be his end.Henry IV.I pray you take me up,and bear me hence Into some other chamber.Softly,pray.The Prince enters a chamber Westminster palace and is told by Gloucester that Henry IV is exceedingly ill.He remains in the chamber when the others withdrew.Thinking his father is dead he soliloquizes on the crown then puts on the crown and walks away.The king wakens and realizes that the Prince has taken his crown and assumes he wants to hasten his death to get it.But Warwick assures Henry IV that Prince is in the next room weeping at his father’s death.Prince returns with the crown.Henry IV is deeply offended,chastises him,and indicates he thinks Prince wants his death hastened,and envisions his kingdom going to the dogs.But Prince contritely asks for pardon,explaining that he thought Henry IV dead,and was in the process of upbraiding the crown for how it had hastened Henry IV’s death,and was trying it as one would try an enemy.Henry IV is consoled and Prince sits besides him.Henry IV recalls the misdeeds and crooked paths by which he won the crown,and how he has been troubled by that knowledge,hoping the crown will lie more quietly on Prince’s head.He counsels Prince to divert the potential enemies in his court,as Henry IV intended.Shakespeare’s English Historic Plays 129 He recommends that he “busy giddy minds with foreign quarrels”.He asks God’s forgiveness for how he came by the crown.Henry IV asks the name of the room in which he fainted and Warwick tells him it was the Jerusalem room.Henry IV realizes by the prophecy that the ‘Jerusalem’ actually applied to that room,and asks to be carried there.Henry IV.Laud be to God! Even there my life must end.It hath been prophesied to me many years,I should not die but in Jerusalem; Which vainly I suppos’d the Holy Land.But bear me to that chamber; there I’ll lie; In that Jerusalem shall Harry die.Act 5 Warwick informs Chief Justice that the king is dead.Lord Chief Justice.How doth the King? Earl of Warwick.Exceeding well; his cares are now all ended.Lord Chief Justice.I hope,not dead.Earl of Warwick.He’s walk’d the way of nature; And to our purposes he lives no more.They discuss the supposed enmity between Henry V and the Chief Justice.Earl of Warwick.Indeed,I think the young king loves you not.Lord Chief Justice.I know he doth not,and do arm myself To welcome the condition of the time,Which cannot look more hideously upon me Than I have drawn it in my fantasy.Henry IV’s other sons are apprehensive about Henry V’s intentions.Prince John.We meet like men that had forgot to speak.Earl of Warwick.We do remember; but our argument Is all too heavy to admit much talk.Prince John.Well,peace be with him that hath made us heavy! Lord Chief Justice.Peace be with us,lest we be heavier! Prince Humphrey.O,good my lord,you have lost a friend And I dare swear you borrow not that face Of seeming sorrow—it is sure your own.Serap Magill & Shahin Khalilli 130 Henry V arrives He acknowledges the fear the others are feeling and reassures his brothers.The Chief Justice will not beg or recant for his new king.Henry V.You all look strangely on me; and you most.You are,I think,assur'd I love you not.Lord Chief Justice.I am assur'd,if I be measur'd rightly,Your Majesty hath no just cause to hate me.He recalls how the Chief Justice sent him to prison for boxing his ears.Henry V.No? How might a prince of my great hopes forget So great indignities you laid upon me? What,rate,rebuke,and roughly send to prison,Th’immediate heir of England! Was this easy? May this be wash'd in Lethe and forgotten? The Chief Justice eloquently defends himself:he was the image of the king,such an offence was therefore against the king,and Henry V would himself not tolerate another man doing this to his own representative.Lord Chief Justice.I then did use the person of your father; The image of his power lay then in me; And in th’administration of his law,Whiles I was busy for the commonwealth,Your Highness pleased to forget my place,The majesty and power of law and justice,The image of the King whom I presented,And struck me in my very seat of judgment; Whereon,as an offender to your father,I gave bold way to my authority And did commit you.… Henry V agrees and magnanimously confirms that the Chief Justice will continue in his position and provide him with guidance.In Shallow’s orchard in Gloucestershire,Pistol arrives,saying Falstaff is now one of the greatest men in the realm.Falstaff.What wind blew you hither,Pistol? Pistol.Not the ill wind which blows no man to good.Sweet thou art now one of the greatest men in this realm.Shakespeare’s English Historic Plays 131 Pistol envisions great riches ahead,though slow to get to the facts,and rebukes Silence for breaking in with more singing.He tells Falstaff that Henry V is now king.Falstaff expects great things and positions for himself and his friends.Falstaff.Away,Bardolph! saddle my horse.Master Robert choose what office thou wilt in the land,‘tis thine.Pistol,will double-charge thee with dignities.In a street in London the beadle and officers arrest Quickly and Doll for the death of a man they and Pistol beat.First Beadle.The constables have delivered her over to me; and she shall have whipping-cheer enough,I warrant her.There hath been a man or two lately kill’d about her.Doll claims to be pregnant,a common and in this case an unsuccessful ploy.Doll Tearsheet.Nut-hook,nut-hook,you lie.Come on; I’ll tell thee what,thou damn’d tripe-visag’d rascal,an the child I now go with do miscarry,thou wert better thou hadst struck thy mother,thou paper-fac’d villain.Near Westminster Abbey Henry V comes by procession and Falstaff calls out “King Hal”.Henry V asks the Chief Justice to speak to the foolish man.Falstaff persists,and Henry V tells him:Henry V.I know thee not,old man.Fall to thy prayers.How ill white hairs become a fool and jester! I have long dreamt of such a kind of man,So surfeit-swell'd,so old,and so profane; But being awak'd,I do despise my dream.Make less thy body hence,and more thy grace; Leave gormandizing; know the grave doth gape For thee thrice wider than for other men— Reply not to me with a fool-born jest; Presume not that I am the thing I was,For God doth know,so shall the world perceive,That I have turn'd away my former self; So will I those that kept me company.When thou dost hear I am as I have been,Approach me,and thou shalt be as thou wast,Serap Magill & Shahin Khalilli 132 The tutor and the feeder of my riots.Till then I banish thee,on pain of death,As I have done the rest of my misleaders,Not to come near our person by ten mile.For competence of life I will allow you,That lack of means enforce you not to evils; And,as we hear you do reform yourselves,We will,according to your strengths and qualities,Give you advancement.Be it your charge,my lord,To see perform'd the tenour of our word.Set on.Falstaff is banished to remain at least ten miles from King Henry V presence.Falstaff is told to reform and will be advanced according to his strengths and qualities.Falstaff assures Shallow that Henry V will yet call him in private.The Chief Justice has Falstaff and his company taken to the Fleet prison.Prince John predicts that within the year,they will be engaged in war in France.Prince John.I will lay odds that,ere this year expire,We bear our civil swords and native fire As far as France.I heard a bird so sing,Whose music,to my thinking,pleas’d the King.Come,will you hence? Epilogue Epilogue tells the audience that she was previously there at the end of a displeasing play and that Falstaff will continue in the story of Henry V to follow,and that Sir John Oldcastle,who had died a martyr,is not the same as the Falstaff of the play.Shakespeare’s English Historic Plays 133 King Henry V Serap Magill & Shahin Khalilli 134 16.Henry V Reigned 21 March 1413 to 31 August 1422 Predecessor Henry IV Successor Henry VI Born 16 September 1387,(1387-09-16)Monmouth,Wales Died 31 August 1422 (aged 34),Buried Bois de Vincennes,France Burial Westminster Abbey,London Chronology for Henry V 1413.Henry crowned upon the death of his father.He allays still further the domestic troubles of the kingdom by reconciling to his cause the young Earl of March,and the Percy family.1414-15.France is distracted by internal feuds.Charles VI the king is subject to fits of insanity.The government carried on by the bitter rivals his brother Louis of Orleans and his cousin John of Burgundy.Henry V.takes advantage of the state of affairs to make extravagant demands upon France,embracing certain provinces,the hand of the Princess Katharine,a large sum of money finally the crown in right of his descent from Edward III.1415.These terms are rejected and Henry decides to invade France.A domestic conspiracy is discovered between the Earl of Cambridge,Lord Scrope,and Sir Thomas Grey,in behalf of the claims of the young Earl of March,to the throne (although probably without his knowledge).The conspirators are arrested and executed.Henry and his army lay siege to Harfleur,which capitulates.Henry moves toward Calais,October 8th.Battle of Agincourt,October 25th.Henry returns in triumph to London,November 23d.1416.France is still distracted and Burgundy allies himself with Henry.Desultory warfare continues between France and England.1417.Henry again lands in France and has little successes.1418.Burgundy allies himself with the queen-regnant against the Dauphin and the Orleans faction.Shakespeare’s English Historic Plays 135 1419.Henry and Burgundy’s faction meet,but negotiations fail due to Henry’s excessive demands.Burgundy makes overtures to the Dauphin and he is assassinated.The new Duke of Burgundy breaks off negotiations with the Dauphin and brings his party,including the queen and Princess Katharine to Henry V’s villegiance.1420.Treaty of Troyes May 21,which the King of England was to receive the hand of the Princess Katharine and immediate regency of the kingdom and recognized as successor on the death of Charles VI.Henry marries Katharine,June 2.1422.Henry V.dies.Dramatis Personae King Henry V Lewis,the Dauphin Duke of Bedford,Duke of Exeter Dukes of Burgundy Duke of York The Constable of France Earls Salisbury,Westmoreland,Warwick Rambures and Grandpré Archbishop of Canterbury Montjoy Bishop of Ely Governor of Harfleur Earl of Cambridge Ambassadors to England Lord Scroop,Sir Thomas Grey Isabel,Queen of France Sir Thomas Erpingham,Gower Katherine,Alice Captains Fluellen,Macmorris,Jamy Tavern hostess,wife of Pistol Bates,Court,Williams Lords,Ladies,Officers,Soldiers Pistol,Nym,Bardolph Citizens,herald Charles VI,King of France Boy,Chorus Introduction ‘Henry V.is not one of Shakespeare’s best plays,but it is one of his most amiable.He here shows himself not as the almost superhuman genius,but as the English patriot,whose enthusiasm is as beautiful as it is simple,and whose prejudices even,are not unbecoming.The play not only points backward to the greatest period of England’s past,but forward to King James,who,as the Protestant son of the Catholic Mary Stuart,was to put an end to religious persecutions,and who,as a Scotchman and a supporter the Irish policy of Essex,was for the first time to show the world not only a sturdy England,but a powerful Great Britain.’ Brandes,George 1898,William Shakespeare,A Critical Study,vol.I,p.243.Serap Magill & Shahin Khalilli 136 As the noblest glories of England are presented in this play,so it presents Shakespeare’s ideal of active,practical,heroic manhood.If Hamlet exhibits the dangers and weakness of the contemplative nature,and Prospero,its calm and its conquest,Henry exhibits the utmost greatness which the active nature can attain In this play no character except Henry greatly interested Shakespeare,unless it be the Welsh Fluellen,whom he loves (as Scott loved the Baron of Bradwardine)for his real simplicity underlying his apparatus of learning,and his touching faith in the theory of warfare.Dowden,Edward,1877,Shakespeare,(Literature Primers),pp.100,101.Setting:The setting of the acts of this play are; In England,the king’s palace,a London street a tavern,Southampton and in France,A royal palace,Harfleur,Agincourt,Picardy between 1413-1420 Synopsis of the play This play opens with a prologue given by a character called Chorus; however,the idea of a chorus is unusual in Shakespeare’s plays.Prologue to the play The Chorus sets the scene of the play and asks the audience to use their imagination to imagine the battle scenes.Chorus.Piece out our imperfections with your thoughts; Into a thousand parts divide on man,And make imaginary puissance; Think when we talk of horses,that you see them Printing their proud hoofs i’the receiving earth; Act 1 In the first scene,young Henry V has just ascended the English throne due to the untimely death of his father Henry IV.The English bishops are concerned about a new bill going through Parliament that would strip the Church of half of its revenue.Archbishop of Canterbury.It must be thought on.If it pass against us,We lose the better half of our possession:The Bishops hope to distract Henry and the nation from accepting the bill by offering the king a significant sum of money to finance a new military campaign in France.Shakespeare’s English Historic Plays 137 Archbishop of Canterbury.And in regard of causes now in hand,Which I have open’d to his grace at large,As touching France,to give a greater sum Than ever at one time the clergy yet Did to his predecessors part withal.The conflict between the France and England has dragged on for generations.The Archbishop of Canterbury assures Henry that he has a sound legal claim to the French throne,through the use of the Salic law*.1Henry resolves to take a small expeditionary force into France.Henry V.We must not only arm to invade the French,But lay down our proportions to defend Against the Scot,who will make road upon us With all advantages.Ambassadors from France arrive to meet King Henry and give him a scornful and taunting message from the Dauphin.First Ambassador.Desires you let the dukedoms that you claim Hear no more of you.This the Dauphin speaks.The message intensifies Henry’s resolve to go to war with France and teach the French to taunt the English King.Henry V.Tell you the Dauphin I am coming on,To venge me as I may and to put forth My rightful hand in a well-hallow’d cause.So get you hence in peace; and tell the Dauphin His jest will savour but of shallow wit,When thousands weep more than did laugh at it.Convey them with safe conduct.Fare you well.… Henry V.So get you hence in peace; and tell the Dauphin His jest will savour but of shallow wit,When thousands weep more than did laugh at it.Convey them with safe conduct.Fare you well.* In 1316,in events which would later lead to the Hundred Years’ War (1337-1453),upon the first situation in the history of the Capetian kings where the closest relative of the dead king was not a son,French lords (notably led by the late king's uncle,Philip of Poitiers,the beneficiary of their position)wanted to forbid inheritance by a woman.In this case,in order to favour the previous king's (John I the Posthumous's)uncle Philip's claim over John's half-sister Joan,these lords wanted to totally disqualify the claim of the future Joan II of Navarre as well as disqualifying any possible future claims of Edward III of England to the French throne.(Wikipedia)Serap Magill & Shahin Khalilli 138 Act 2 The Chorus describes the patriotic fervour with which the young men of England prepare for war.Chorus.Now all the youth of England are on fire,And silken dalliance in the wardrobe lies:Now thrive the armourers,and honour’s thought Reigns solely in the breast of every man:Chorus also warns of the treacherous intentions of Richard,Earl of Cambridge,Lord Scroop and Sir Thomas Grey,who have accepted payment from France to assassinate Henry before the invasion can commence.Chorus.One,Richard Earl of Cambridge,and the second,Henry Lord Scroop of Masham,and the third,Sir Thomas Grey,knight,of Northumberland,Have,for the gilt of France,—O guilt indeed! Confirm’d conspiracy with fearful France; However,the plot is revealed,the traitors are executed,and the invasion plans go forward.King Henry V.For this revolt of thine,methinks,is like Another fall of man.Their faults are open:Arrest them to the answer of the law; And God acquit them of their practises! Act 3 When the English land at the port of Harfleur in Normandy,they besiege the city but suffer heavy losses through war and disease.Act III opens in front of the castle at Harfleur.Henry rallies his troops with a rousing speech exhorting them to prove the mettle of Englishmen.King Henry V.Once more unto the breach,dear friends,once more; Or close the wall up with our English dead.In peace there’s nothing so becomes a man As modest stillness and humility:1095 But when the blast of war blows in our ears,Then imitate the action of the tiger; Stiffen the sinews,summon up the blood,Disguise fair nature with hard-favour’d rage; Shakespeare’s English Historic Plays 139 The final assault persuades the Governor of Harfleur to surrender.The French nobles resolve to bring together all their forces to crush the “sick and famished” English army before it can return to England for the winter.They offer Henry a ransom,but the king vows that he will either win on the field or die alongside his soldiers.Nym,Bardolph,Pistol,and Boy are in the thick of the battle for Harfleur and are not encouraged by Henry’s speech.They are behaving very cowardly.Bardolph.On,on,on,on,on! to the breach,to the breach! Nym.Pray thee,corporal,stay:the knocks are too hot; and,for mine own part,I have not a case of lives:the humour of it is too hot,that is the very plain-song of it.Pistol.The plain-song is most just:for humours do abound:Knocks go and come; God’s vassals drop and die; And sword and shield,In bloody field,Doth win immortal fame.Captain Fluellen arrives and cajoles them into being brave and going forward to meet the enemy.Fluellen.Up to the breach,you dogs! avaunt,you cullions! Boy is bemoaning that his friends are not capable of fighting.Boy.As young as I am,I have observed these three swashers.I am boy to them all three:but all they three,though they would serve me,could not be man to me; for indeed three such antics do not amount to a man.For Bardolph,he is white-livered and red-faced; by the means whereof a’faces it out,but fights not.For Pistol,he hath a killing tongue and a quiet sword; by the means whereof a’breaks words,and keeps whole weapons.For Nym,he hath heard that men of few words are the best men; and therefore he scorns to say his prayers,Thereafter,follows a meeting between Fluellen and the Scots captain Macmorris on some of the military preparations.Serap Magill & Shahin Khalilli 140 Act 4 The Chorus describes the night before the battle,as the “confident and over-lusty French” make bets on the scale of their victory,and the “poor condemned English” huddle by their fires,dreading the morning’s encounter with the far more numerous French.Chorus.Proud of their numbers and secure in soul,The confident and over-lusty French Do the low-rated English play at dice; And chide the cripple tardy-gaited night Who,like a foul and ugly witch,doth limp So tediously away.Throughout the night Henry moves through the camp trying to raise the spirits of his men.Henry disguised himself as a common soldier,and learned that many believed that the king has led them to an almost certain death.Chorus.The royal captain of this ruin’d band Walking from watch to watch,from tent to tent,Let him cry ‘Praise and glory on his head!’ For forth he goes and visits all his host.Bids them good morrow with a modest smile And calls them brothers,friends and countrymen.On his own Henry laments on the crushing responsibility of kingship,and prays for the safety of his men.As the morning dawns,the English realize that they are outnumbered 5 men to 1.On overhearing his cousin Westmoreland lamenting on their position,Henry makes a rousing speech arguing that the “happy few” who fight with him at Agincourt will live on in history as the greatest of English heroes.He refuses a final offer of ransom from the French herald,and battle is joined.Henry V.We few,we happy few,we band of brothers; For he to-day that sheds his blood with me Shall be my brother; be he ne’er so vile,This day shall gentle his condition:And gentlemen in England now a-bed Shall think themselves accursed they were not here,And hold their manhoods cheap whiles any speaks That fought with us upon Saint Crispin’s day.Shakespeare’s English Historic Plays 141 Remarkably,the French are routed,and when the two armies count their dead,it is discovered that 10,000 French have been killed,to only 29 English.Act 5 The Chorus describes Henry’s triumphant return to England,where he and his army are greeted as national heroes,followed by his return to France to negotiate the terms of the French surrender.Chorus.Athwart the sea.Behold,the English beach Pales in the flood with men,with wives and boys,Whose shouts and claps out-voice the deep mouth’d sea,Which like a mighty whiffler ‘fore the king Seems to prepare his way:so let him land,And solemnly see him set on to London Chorus.As yet the lamentation of the French Invites the King of England’s stay at home; The emperor’s coming in behalf of France,To order peace between them; and omit All the occurrences,whatever chanced,Till Harry’s back-return again to France:As the French and English negotiators meet,Henry personally woos Katherine to become his wife.Henry V.Fair Katharine,and most fair,Will you vouchsafe to teach a soldier terms Such as will enter at a lady’s ear And plead his love-suit to her gentle heart? Katharine.Your majesty shall mock at me; I cannot speak your England.Henry V.O fair Katharine,if you will love me soundly with your French heart,I will be glad to hear you confess it brokenly with your English tongue.Do you like me,Kate? Just as Henry persuades Katherine to kiss,the negotiators return to inform Henry that the French King has consented to all terms.Henry will marry Katherine and their son will be proclaimed the heir to the French throne,uniting the two nations and bringing about an era of peace.Serap Magill & Shahin Khalilli 142 Earl of Westmoreland.The king hath granted every article:His daughter first,and then in sequel all,According to their firm proposed natures.Duke of Exeter.Only he hath not yet subscribed this:Where your majesty demands,that the King of France,having any occasion to write for matter of grant,shall name your highness in this form and with this addition in French,Notre trescher fils Henri,Roi d’Angleterre,Heritier de France; and thus in Latin,Praeclarissimus filius noster Henricus,Rex Angliae,et Haeres Franciae.King of France.Nor this I have not,brother,so denied,But your request shall make me let it pass.Henry V.I pray you then,in love and dear alliance,Let that one article rank with the rest; And thereupon give me your daughter.King of France.Take her,fair son,and from her blood raise up Issue to me; that the contending kingdoms Of France and England,whose very shores look pale With envy of each other’s happiness,May cease their hatred,and this dear conjunction Plant neighbourhood and Christian-like accord In their sweet bosoms,that never war advance His bleeding sword ‘twixt England and fair France.However,the Chorus concludes the play with a sobering epilogue reminding the audience that Henry,the “Star of England,” died young,leaving the throne to his infant son Henry VI and ushering in a new regime that “lost France and made his England bleed.” Chorus.Thus far,with rough and all-unable pen,Our bending author hath pursued the story,In little room confining mighty men,Mangling by starts the full course of their glory.Small time,but in that small most greatly lived This star of England:Fortune made his sword; By which the world’s best garden be achieved,And of it left his son imperial lord.Henry the Sixth,in infant bands crown’d King Of France and England,did this king succeed; Whose state so many had the managing,That they lost France and made his England bleed:Which oft our stage hath shown; and,for their sake,In your fair minds let this acceptance take.143 PART IV:KING HENRY VIII & KING JOHN Serap Magill & Shahin Khalilli 144 KING

great truth and spirit.It is like a very disagreeable portrait,sketched by the hand of a master.His gross appearance,his blustering demeanour,his vulgarity,his arrogance,his sensuality,his cruelty,his hypocrisy,his want of common decency and common humanity are marked in strong lines.His traditional peculiarities of expression complete the reality of the picture.The authoritative expletive,“Ha!” with which he intimates his indignation or surprise,has an effect like the first startling sound that breaks from a thunder-cloud.He is of all the monarchs in our history the most disgusting:for he unites in himself all the vices is of barbarism and refinement,without their virtues.WILLIAM HAZLITT,1817-69.Characters of Shakespeare’s Plays,p.170.Setting The action for this play mostly takes place in London.Various apartments in the Palace and in Westminster are the London setting.York,Blackfriars and Kimbolton are the other named settings.Synopsis of the play Three tragical events,elaborately interwoven,form the centres of dramatic treatment.(I.)The execution of the Duke of Buckingham.(II.)The divorce of Katharine of Aragon.(III.)The disgrace and fall of Cardinal Wolsey.(Warner,1899,p.244)Act 1 Buckingham complains to Norfolk of Cardinal Wolsey’s controlling hand in recent peace negotiations with France.Abergavenny,accompanying them,agrees with

Magill & Shahin Khalilli 148 Queen Katharine.I am solicited,not by a few,And those of true condition,that your subjects Are in great grievance:there have been commissions Sent down among 'em,which hath flaw'd the heart Of all their loyalties:wherein,although,My good lord cardinal,they vent reproaches Most bitterly on you,as putter on Of these exactions,yet the king our master— Whose honour heaven shield from soil!— even he escapes not Language unmannerly,yea,such which breaks The sides of loyalty,and almost appears In loud rebellion.Duke of Norfolk.Not almost appears,It doth appear;

Why,what a shame was this! Did my commission Bid ye so far forget yourselves? I gave ye Power as he was a counsellor to try him,Not as a groom:there's some of ye,I see,More out of malice than integrity,Would try him to the utmost,had ye mean; Which ye shall never have while I live.Henry VIII’s daughter Elizabeth is baptized by Cranmer.Cranmer predicts that Elizabeth will be a great Queen,though she will die a virgin and many will mourn her passing.Archbishop Cranmer.She shall be,to the happiness of England,An aged princess; many days shall see her,And yet no day without a deed to crown it.Would I had known no more! but she must die,She must,the saints must have her; yet a virgin,A most unspotted lily shall she pass To the ground,and all the world shall mourn her.Serap Magill & Shahin Khalilli 158 KING JOHN Shakespeare’s English Historic Plays 159 18.King John Reigned 6 April 1199 to 18/19 October 1216 Predecessor Richard I the Lionheart Successor Henry III Born 24 December 1166,Beaumont Palace,Oxford Died 18/19 October 1216 (aged 49)Newark Castle,Newark-on-Trent,Nottinghamshire Burial Worcester Cathedral,Worcester Chronology for King John 1199.John was crowned at Westminster on May 27.Arthur Plantagenet the lineal heir,Duke of Bretagne,asked for the assistance of Philip of France to maintain his rights over the French provinces.King John entered France with an army to enforce the English claim.1200.By an agreement between John and Philip,Lewis the Dauphin and Blanche of Castile are married,and a satisfactory division of the provinces in dispute is made,Arthur retained Brittany.1202.Philip breaks this treaty with King John to avoid papal censure.War is resumed and Arthur is taken prisoner by King John.1203.Arthur dies under suspicious circumstances at Rouen.1204.King John loses Normandy which is united with the crown of France.1205-7.In the election of an Archbishop of Canterbury,Pope Innocent insisted upon his right to nominate Stephen Langton.John defies the Pope,maintaining his own supreme right of nomination,and refuses to allow Langton at Canterbury.1208-9.King John is excommunication of by Pope Innocent III.1212.Innocent deposes King John,and commands Philip of France to invade England and carry the sentence into effect.1213-14.John,frightened by the result of his opposition to the Pope,basely submits and pays homage to Rome for his crown,the English nobles,led by Stephen Langton,to resent the betrayal of the kingdom and their liberties.Serap Magill & Shahin Khalilli 160 1215.The Magna Carta signed,but almost immediately violated by King John.The English nobles appeal to France and promise to choose the Dauphin Lewis as their king,if he will help them with an army against John.1216.The French army arrives in England.Before battle King John dies and his son is crowned Henry III of England.The French army and the Dauphin Lewis is forced to return to France.Dramatis Personae King John of England Lewis the Dauphin Prince Henry~ King Henry III English Herald Arthur Duke of Bretagne Lymoges,Archduke of Austria Earl of Pembroke Cardinal Pandulph Earl of Essex Melun,a French Lord Earl of Salisbury Chatillon,France ambassador Lord Bigot Earl of Norfolk Queen Elinor Hubert de Burgh Constance,mother of Arthur Robert Falconbridge Blanch of Spain Phillip Falconbridge Lady Falconbridge James Gurney servant French Herald,Executioner Peter of Pomfret,a prophet Messenger,Citizens King Phillip of France Introduction The tragedy of “King John,” though not written with the utmost power of Shakespeare,is varied with a very pleasing interchange of incidents and characters.The lady’s grief is very affecting; and the character of the bastard contains that mixture of greatness and levity which this author delighted to exhibit.Samuel Johnson,1768 General Observations on Shakespeare’s Plays.Shakespeare’s English Historic Plays 161 Almost any prose can by cut up into blank verse,but blank verse becomes the finest vehicle of thought in the language of Shakespeare and Milton.As far as I am aware,no one has noticed what great AEschylean*1lines there are in Shakespeare,particularly in “King John.” Alfred,Lord Tennyson,1883,Some Criticisms on Poets,Memoir by His Son,vol.II,p.289.Setting The setting of the acts of this play are; In England,the king’s palace,and in France.The time period is for the action in the play is approx.1210-1216 A.D.King John signed the Magna Carta,though Shakespeare makes no mention of this.Synopsis of the play Warner in ‘English History in Shakespeare’s plays’ give four centres of action:(1.)The disputed title of John,and the political intrigues of Philip of France resulting there from,including the use of Arthur,John’s nephew,as a movable pawn by all parties.(2.)The quarrel of King John with Pope Innocent (3.)Concerning the filling of the vacant see of Canterbury,which ended in John’s disgraceful reconciliation,at the price of holding the crown of England as a fief of the Pope?

King John.A grave.Hubert de Burgh.He shall not live.Pandulph suggests to Prince Lewis that he should attempt to become King of England.Pandulph encouragement of Prince Lewis plays on the assumption of the presumed inevitable outrage by the English people over Arthur’s ‘sure-to-come’ murder by King John’s agents.Act 4 Hubert de Burg makes his preparations for Arthur’s murder and intends to burn out Prince’s eyes:Hubert de Burgh.Heat me these irons hot; and look thou stand Within the arras:when I strike my foot Upon the bosom of the ground,rush forth,And bind the boy which you shall find with me Fast to the chair:be heedful:hence,and watch.First Executioner.I hope your warrant will bear out the deed.Hubert de Burgh.Uncleanly scruples! fear not you:look to't.[Exeunt Executioners] Young lad,come forth; I have to say with you.After Hubert’s conversation with Prince Arthur he decides against murdering the prince and warns him that he is in great danger.Hubert de Burgh.Well,see to live; I will not touch thine eye For all the treasure that thine uncle owes:Yet am I sworn and I did purpose,boy,With this same very iron to burn them out.Arthur.O,now you look like Hubert! all this while You were disguised.Hubert de Burgh.Peace; no more.Adieu.Your uncle must not know but you are dead; Serap Magill & Shahin Khalilli 168 I'll fill these dogged spies with false reports:And,pretty child,sleep doubtless and secure,That Hubert,for the wealth of all the world,Will not offend thee.Arthur.O heaven! I thank you,Hubert.Hubert de Burgh.Silence; no more:go closely in with me:Much danger do I undergo for thee.The English Lords believe that Prince Arthur has been murdered and denounce King John for

battles.A dying Frenchman,Melun,warns the English Lords that Lewis plans to behead them as soon as the battle with the English is over,so the English Lords switch back to King John’s side.Melun.Fly,noble English,you are bought and sold; Unthread the rude eye of rebellion And welcome home again discarded faith.Seek out King John and fall before his feet; For if the French be lords of this loud day,He means to recompense the pains you take Shakespeare’s English Historic Plays 169 By cutting off your heads:thus hath he sworn And I with him,and many moe with me,Upon the altar at Saint Edmundsbury; Even on that altar where we swore to you Dear amity and everlasting love.The papal legate Pandulph convinces the French to make peace and return to France.Cardinal Pandulph.It was

death.While King John rests at a monastery he is poisoned by a monk.The monk dies after tasting the food he gave to King John.King John.Poison'd,—ill fare—dead,forsook,cast off:And none of you will bid the winter come To thrust his icy fingers in my maw,Nor let my kingdom's rivers take their course Through my burn'd bosom,nor entreat the north To make his bleak winds kiss my parched lips And comfort me with cold.I do not ask you much,I beg cold comfort; and you are so strait And so ingrateful,you deny me that.Prince Henry is named the new king of England and Philip the bastard ends the play with a prophetic message:Philip the Bastard.O,let us pay the time but needful woe,Since it hath been beforehand with our griefs.This England never did,nor never shall,Lie at the proud foot of a conqueror,But when it first did help to wound itself.Now these her princes are come home again,Come the three corners of the world in arms,And we shall shock them.Nought shall make us rue,If England to itself do rest but true.Serap Magill & Shahin Khalilli 170 171 PART V:HISTORIC REFERENCES Serap Magill & Shahin Khalilli 172 Shakespeare’s English Historic Plays 173 19.Oriental References in the English Historic Plays Prof.Dr Shahin Khalilli One might suppose that Shakespeare could make historical references to Albania (modern Azerbaijan)and the Safavid Azerbaijan of 1501 – 1736.We would say that the Safavid state of Azerbaijan has always been a rich and colourful source of references for the writers from different ages and periods in the literary history of the world.The oral and written transmission of historical novels and stories and of course the publication of traveller’s books on Azerbaijan and the orient,on the whole,have inspired poets and writers to make references to oriental events in their books and especially so,during the English renaissance period.Shakespeare’s contemporaries and fellow dramatists John Day,William Rowley and George Wilkins combined in 1607 to write a play entitled ‘Travels of The Three English Brothers’.The play was based on the adventure of the Shirley brothers who travelled through Persia and Azerbaijan.The play shows the Emperor Shah Abbas as the Muslim ruler of the time.The publication of Sir Anthony Shirley’s ‘Relations of Travels into Persia’ (1613)and of course Thomas Herbert’s ‘A Relation of Some Years of Travaile’ (1637),inspired poets and writers to write plays or touch on the historical background of oriental affairs and events.Shakespeare made a number of allusions to the ancient and medieval emperors of Azerbaijan,but these allusions were under the name of the Safavid dynasty of Persia in which the Azerbaijan Turkic language was the state language of the time.As a dramatist,Shakespeare probably became acquainted with Persia,the Safavids,and their rulers through the accounts of travellers to the place that is now the modern Iranian region and to the north and south Caucuses and beyond.The question is which major books were written or kept in a handwritten form in London during Shakespeare’s time.We could point out the following:‘Account of the Voyage of Ralph Fitch Merchant of London’,‘The Long Dangerous and Memorable Voyage of M.Serap Magill & Shahin Khalilli 174 Ralph Fitch …’ Richard Hakluyt’s ‘The Principal Navigations Voyages Traffiques & Discoveries of the English Nation’(1589 – 1590).Anthony Jenkinson,an English traveller and trader,had a meeting with Shah Tahmasib the son of Shah Ismail.Although Jenkinson presented Shah Tahmasib with gifts,the Shah ceased to be interested in any further contact with England when he found out that it was a Christian country.It should however be noted,that the timing of Jenkinson’s visit to the Shah was rather inopportune as the Shah had recently signed a friendship treaty with the Turks.The Turks regarded all Europeans as potential enemies.When the Shah allowed Jenkinson to leave his territory,he presented Jenkinson with a rich oriental garment.One might think that Jenkinson’s account of his visit to Azerbaijan,the city of Gazvin and to Shah Tahmasib’s court attracted Shakespeare’s attention and made him touch upon the accounts mentioned in some of his Historical Plays.However,Shakespeare introduced the country in his works as Safavid Persia not as he should have done and introduced it as the Safavid state of Azerbaijan.Roger Savory a professor of history,in his work ‘Iran under the Safavids’ noted on the ‘sophy’ often mentioned in Shakespeare’s plays:‘The Safavid Shahs were commonly termed by Western writers ‘Sophie’,‘Sophy’,‘Sophi’ or ‘Soffi’ all these terms were probably corruptions of ‘Safi’,the name of the founder of the Safavid Order rather than of Sufi as the Safavid supporters called themselves.’ Of course by mentioning the different versions of the word ‘Sophi’,which are accepted as corruptions of ‘Safi’,indicates that the great grandfather of Shah Ismail Khatai,Shaykh Safi ad-Din (1252 – 1334),can probably be accepted as a supporter or follower of Sufism.In Shakespeare’s play ‘The Merchant of Venice’,1600,the prince of Morocco when addressing Portia says:Even for that I thank you:Therefore,I pray you,lead me to the caskets To try my fortune.By this scimitar,--That slew the Sophy and a Persian prince,That won three fields of Sultan Solyman,--I would o’erstare the sternest eyes that look,(act II,i)Shakespeare’s English Historic Plays 175 Neither Sophy (Shakespeare’s Sophie meant Shah Ismails’ son,Shah Tahmasib*),1nor the prince were slain in the wars between Safavid Azerbaijan and Turkey in the 16th century.Shah Ishmael was badly wounded in the heavy fighting between Safavid Azerbaijan and Turkey and escaped capture in the battle of Chaldiran in 1514.In those lines quoted above Sultan Suleiman is mentioned.The Suleiman mentioned,can only be the Padishah Suleiman the law maker,who reigned as Sultan of the Ottoman Empire from 1520 to 1566.It would appear that Shakespeare,when he referred to Jenkinson’s travels in the Azerbaijan area,falsified or changed some of the major details and facts of the history of the Azerbaijan area.The Ottoman Padishah Suleiman made several attacks on Safavid Azerbaijan and we claim that the ruler of the Safavids at the time of referred to in the merchant of Venice was Shah Ismail’s son,the Shah Tahmasib I.Shakespeare used the history and colour of the orient in almost every one of his plays.In his ‘King Henry V’,when King Henry addresses the first French ambassador:Either our history shall with full mouth Speak freely of our acts,or else our grave,Like Turkish mute,shall have a tongueless mouth,Not worshipp’d with a waxen epitaph.(HenryV Act I,ii)A characteristic of European monarchs was their fondness of wearing oriental style clothes,these clothes being Turkish,Azerbaijani or Persian.These clothes and costumes were often worn on special occasions.The diarist Samuel Pepys and John Evelyn record that Louis XIV and Charles II competed with one another to obtain richer costumes or garments.In the second part of ‘King Henry IV’,King Henry V says:* Shah Ismail died on May 23rd 1524 when he was two months short of his 37th birthday.His son Tahmasib I became king (1524-1576)Serap Magill & Shahin Khalilli 176 This new and gorgeous garment,majesty,Sits not so easy on me as you think.Brothers,you mix your sadness with some fear.This is the English,not the Turkish court,King Henry (Act II,i)and in King Lear,Lear says to Edgar:You,sir,I entertain for one of my hundred; only I do not like the fashion of your garments:you will say they are Persian attire:but let them be changed.King Lear (Act III,vi)We would dare to note that one of the ancient links between the far away land of Britain and today’s Azerbaijan.The flow of the nations from the east to the west and to the north put traces of the naming of some countries.From Herodot in his ‘History’ and Edmund Spenser in his “A View of the Present State of Ireland’ mentioned the links between the east and the west.The people from Albany,today’s Azerbaijan,comes traces of the name Albion for Britain.The appellations Albyne,Albion,Saint Albans,Arran isles relate to the ancient name indicating Britain.In the third part of Shakespeare’s ‘Henry VI’,Warwick says to King Henry’s son Edward:I,then in London keeper of the king,Muster’d my soldiers,gather’d flocks of friends,740 And very well appointed,as I thought,March’d toward Saint Alban’s to intercept the queen,Bearing the king in my behalf along; (Henry VI,ii)In the second part of Henry VI there is an oriental manner presented by Shakespeare:Duke of Gloucester.My lords,Saint Alban here hath done a miracle; and would ye not think his cunning to be great,that could restore this cripple to his legs again? Simpcox.O master,that you could! Duke of Gloucester.My masters of Saint Alban’s,have you not beadles in your town,and things called whips? Mayor of Saint Alban’s.Yes,my lord,if it please your grace.Shakespeare’s English Historic Plays 177 Duke of Gloucester.Then send for one presently.Mayor of Saint Alban’s.Sirrah,go fetch the beadle hither straight.(Henry VI Act II,i)The reader of Shakespearian historical plays often meets the realm of Albion,which by inference might be derived from ancient Albania.Another use of Albion appears in Henry VI part iii,when Queen Margaret speaks to the king of France:Queen Margaret.No,mighty King of France:now Margaret Must strike her sail and learn awhile to serve Where kings command.I was,I must confess,Great Albion’s queen in former golden days:(Henry VI Act III,iii)Shakespeare did not just put the history of England and its kings into his historical plays but he enriched them with some history of the ancient people of the east.In an allusion to ‘Tomyris’ the female ruler of the ancient land of Azerbaijan and the Massaget tribe,in Henry VI part I,the countess of the Auvergne declares:Countess.The plot is laid:if all things fall out right,I shall as famous be by this exploit As Scythian Tomyris by Cyrus’death.(Henry VI Act II,iii)The curious reader who may want amplification on Tomyris’ and the Scythians may want to consult Edmund Spenser’s already mentioned book “A View of the Present State of Ireland’.In the first part of ‘Henry VI’,Charles says:King Charles.Was Mahomet inspired with a dove? Thou with an eagle art inspired then.Helen,the mother of great Constantine,Nor yet Saint Philip’s daughters,were like thee.Bright star of Venus,fall’n down on the earth,How may I reverently worship thee enough? (Henry VI Act I,ii)When Shakespeare’s were performed in London in Elizabethan times the spectators of those plays had knowledge of the Prophet Muhammad (Mahomet as Shakespeare calls him).Serap Magill & Shahin Khalilli 178 It is said that the Prophet Muhammad kept a dove,which he used to feed with wheat out of his ear.The dove when it was hungry would alight on to the Prophet’s shoulder,thrust its beak into the Prophet’s ear,and eat a grain of wheat.According to Sir Walter Raleigh:Mahomet had a dove which he used to feed with wheat out of his ear.When the dove was hungry it used to light on the prophet’s shoulder,and thrust its bill into his ear to find its meal.Mahomet thus induced the Arabs to believe that he was inspired by the Holy Ghost in the semblance of a dove.(Sir Walter Raleigh:History of the World,bk.1.i.chap.vi.)This information may have been taken by Shakespeare and used in Henry VI Pt I.However,Raleigh’s story is not likely to be accepted by those who study and follow the accepted traditions of the Prophet.*1 Prophet Muhammad was a man of peace,and even a symbol of peace,hence Shakespeare’s symbolic use of the dove in the second scene of act I in Henry VI part I.Prophet Muhammad never used a sword,never had any military training,and never participated in a battle except as an observer.He proved to be a great soldier who never gave up even in the most challenging battles he engaged in to spread the Islamic faith and the oneness of God.‘He had to do this for the peace in his society despite an endless mercy that encompassed the whole of humanity’ (‘The Prophet of Mercy Muhammad.Scenes from his Life’,Osman Nuri Topbash,Erkam Publications,Istanbul,2001,p.37)Shakespeare was fond of his ‘Englishness’.Shakespeare came from a family of pure English ancestry.He lived the 52 years of his life in Stratford and London and was a Christian.Ten of his 37 plays were devoted to the history of England and its kings.* There is no traceable record of such a tradition in the accepted traditions of the Prophet Muhammad.Shakespeare’s English Historic Plays 179 Explanatory Topics For Discussion And Writing 1.Elizabethans stressed,that history was the record of moral law at work.A century and a half of English history forms the framework of Shakespeare’s greatest historical plays.His Plays dealt with the events which were very important for the common people as well.What do you know about the history and the fate of English kings? 2.When the Queen Elizabeth I (1533-1603)had ascended the throne in 1558 England had been a very poor country.But 30 years later – about 1588 thanks to the Queen,the English had become a great nation.The English felt themselves reborn,and filled with a pride,confidence; and pride in their language was great as well.The history plays became popular.Why? 3.England had never had so young a King as Henry VI.He was not quite nine months old when he was proclaimed to be the King of England.At the age of three and a half he opened Parliament and then rode through London in triumph.And on 6 November 1429,St.Leonard’s Day,he was crowned at Westminster.In his youth at least he was by no mean simple-minded; on the contrary he was well educated,and from an early age took a precocious interest in political affairs.Write an essay on Henry VI as the dramatic character of Shakespeare’s History play.4.King Richard III,the only English ruler since the Norman Conquest to have been killed in battle,is also the only one to have become a legend.That legend,due first to Sir Thomas More and then to Shakespeare,is of the lame and twisted hunchback whose misshapen body reflects the evil heart in it.Shakespeare’s comedies and tragedies dealt with man as a social unit.But his History Plays presented men in political societies.Characterize Richard II.5.“Richard II” is very similar to “King John”.The strategy of the plays is to present one man yielding to another.They might make much use of debate of scenes of trial and confrontation.Write your essay on specific resemblances,especially on patriotism and rebellion.Richard is full Shakespearen portrait of king.Shakespeare’s Richard and the historical Richard really have in common are royalism and good looks.Evaluate this view.Shakespeare dealt with the climax of the Tudors’ version of the past,putting the monster-king Richard III on the stage,he turned the Serap Magill & Shahin Khalilli 180 character into an actor and a master of illusion (F.W.Brownlow,Professor of English Language and Literature).Where do you stand,and why? 6.King.God knows,my son,By what by-paths and indirect crook’d ways I met this crown,and I myself know well How troublesome it sat upon my head.King Henry IV.Part II.At the time of his accession the richest man in England,he had almost immediately found himself in the desperate financial difficulties.And it had continued throughout his reign.He died a broken and pathetic figure.And what did Shakespeare make of him? The dramatist never falsified the facts,but he was obliged to compress the time scale,telescoping events together as the need arose and sometimes even taking them back to the previous play.What does all the evidence suggest? 7.In some cases Shakespeare departed from the historic truth.He did it so,because he desired to make a better play on English history.At the same time he tried to stick as closely to the facts and truth to create a vivid dramatic and historic picture of England and its kings.“Henry V” is the only greatest history play by Shakespeare.It is a true epic:a patriotic paean celebrating England’s only royal here.More than 500 years had passed since the Norman conquest.And England had been ruled by different kings for more than 500 years before the conquest.With the doubtful exception of Richard the Lionheart,Henry V is the only King of England who is still generally perceived as a hero.Whether he deserved the title must be open to question.Much of his posthumous reputation,inevitably,he owes to Shakespeare.The fact is that,while still under thirty,he twice raised the largest and best-equipped expeditionary force that England had ever seen.He transported it to France – in one of the most celebrated battles in English history,led it to a magnificent victory over an army many times its own size.On the basis of the play how would you characterize Henry V? 8.Between 1608 and 1610 the theatres in London were again closed because of plague,though the epidemic was far less serious than in 1592-1593 or 1603.On 2nd July 1613 Shakespeare’s career as a Shakespeare’s English Historic Plays 181 dramatist was symbolically ended in the destruction of the Globe Theatre when the players were acting “Henry VIII”.The King’s Players staged the play under the title “All is True” representing some principal pieces of the reign of Henry VIII.The chief sources of the play are Holinshed’s “Chronicles” and Foxe’s “Actes and Monuments” (or “Book of Martyrs”).How much of the play “Henry VIII” is Shakespeare’s devising,and how much Fletcher’s,is open to guess.But it is generally agreed that Shakespeare wrote the first two scenes of the first act and the first two scenes of the next two acts.The great set scene of the Consistory Court,the more intimate dialogue between Anne Boleyn and an “old lady” was written by Shakespeare as well.To what extent,it any,do you agree? 9.“Henry VIII”’s plot is taken directly from historical materials which Shakespeare follows very closely.“Henry VIII”,subtitled “All is True”,would not have been allowed in Elizabethan England,but by the time of its production (1613)the earlier anxieties were over and after 10 years of James I’s rule atmosphere was little freer.The persecution of Roman Catholics had quietened down,and the most violent Protestants were under control.“Henry VIII” is a dramatic and poetic whole,and the proof takes two forms.First,the play’s form is compared to the tragic-comedies’,with which it has much in common.Second,the action is shown to embody the teachings of contemporary political doctrine.Could you comment that the play is like a political morality? Write your essay about the King when he finally acts the part of mercy while saving Granmer.10.Elizabeth’s Privy Council was hypersensitive about history,and so greatly embarraced by certain historical parallels.In June 1599 all Shakespeare’s historical plays were forbidden to stage.Write an essay on the given topic.Serap Magill & Shahin Khalilli 182 183 APPENDIX Serap Magill & Shahin Khalilli 184 Shakespeare’s English Historic Plays 185 Appendix 1-Old verb Forms in Shakespeare To help you improve your understanding of Shakespeare’s plays when you read or watch them,some knowledge of ‘old’ English is needed.This brief explanation should help with some of the difficulties that may be encountered in the plays.The English that was used in Shakespeare’s time was different in very many ways from modern English,for instance there have been changes in the use of grammar,vocabulary and pronouns.There have been enormous changes in the spellings of many words since Shakespeare’s time.One of the most striking differences between the English of Shakespeare’s time and modern English occur with the way verbs are used.For example,older English had distinct second-person singular verb forms ending in ‘-st’,with a corresponding second-person singular pronoun thou (the object form thee possessives thy,thine).There were also third-person singular verb forms ending in ‘-th’,and ‘ye’ could be used as a second-person plural pronoun:Tell me what thou knowest.How can I help thee? Where thy master goeth,there goest thou also.Oh come,all ye faithful.Older forms of ‘be’ included ‘art’ and ‘wert’.I fear thou art sick.Wert thou at work today? Questions and negatives were originally made without do; at a later stage,forms with and without do (including affirmative forms with do)were both quite common.Came you by sea or by land? They know not what they do.Be not afraid.Then he did take my hand and kiss it.Simple tenses were often used in cases where modern English has continuous forms.Serap Magill & Shahin Khalilli 186 We go not out today,for it raineth.{we won’t go out today,because it is raining.} Subjunctives were more widely used than in modern English:If she be here,then tell her I wait her pleasure.Inversion was more common in Shakespeare’s English and infinitives and past participles could come later in a clause than is normal in modern English.Now are we lost indeed.Hamlet,thou hast thy father much offended.(Shakespeare)And she me caught in her arms long and small and therewithal so sweetly did me kiss and softly said ‘Dear heart,how like you this?’(Wyatt)Shakespeare’s English Historic Plays 187

2-Family tree ‘The House of Plantagenet’ The above family tree is a much simplified tree of the House of Plantagenet.One should note the duration of the House of Plantagenet shown in the tree ranges from 1330 to 1485 a period of 185 years,though the Plantagenet’s reigned for over 300 years.(From Matilda Empress Maud in 1141)Serap Magill & Shahin Khalilli 188 Appendix 3-Family tree ‘The House of

from early 14th century to late 15th century.*Recently academics have credited Shakespeare along with other co-writers with the production of the play King Edward III and an edition of the Riverside Shakespeare has included the play,and plans are afoot for the Arden Shakespeare and Oxford Shakespeare series to publish editions.Serap Magill & Shahin Khalilli 190 Appendix 5-Battles of the war of the Roses 1450 – 1490 The Wars of the Roses is the name used to refer to a long,repetitive,and destructive civil war for the English crown,between two factions of the English Plantagenet royal family.The war had its origins in a quarrel between Richard II and his cousin Henry Bolingbroke.The consequence of this quarrel was the accession Henry Bolingbroke to the throne of England as Henry IV through the forced abdication of Richard II and his subsequent murder.Richard’s murder brought about a civil war,which continued until Henry IV’s son ascended the throne as Henry V and restored a short interval of peace at home and a particularly glorious military victory at the battle of Agincourt,in France.After Henry V’s early death,the wars for succession to the throne resumed.Henry’s son,Henry VI,who led the branch of the family called the Lancastrians,the party of the Red Rose,was challenged by the Yorkist branch of the family,the party of the White Rose.Success in the war alternated between the two parties for a number of years,until the Yorkists prevailed,and Edward IV came to the throne.When Edward IV died,his brother Richard Duke of Gloucester became King Richard III.The Lancastrian cause was meanwhile taken up by a distant relative of the royal family,Henry Tudor,The Earl of Richmond,who had been exiled to France by Henry IV.The Earl of Richmond’s claim to the throne was based upon the marriage of his grandfather,Owen Tudor,to Henry V’s widow.The Earl of Richmond and his small army invaded England and defeated the Yorkist forces and killed King Richard III at the Battle of Bosworth Field in 1485.Thus,ended the 300 year old Plantagenet dynasty,and began the Royal house of Tudor under King Henry VII.Henry VII was the father of Henry VIII and the grandfather of Queen Elizabeth.Monarchs of the House of Tudor were to reign 118 years until the start of the Stuart dynasty under James I of England.The Battle of Bosworth Field is often given as a marker of the start of the Renaissance in England,as it initiates the first distinctly Shakespeare’s English Historic Plays 191 Renaissance royal family in England,the Tudors,who replaced the medieval Plantagenet royal family.The following table shows the main battles of the ‘Wars of the Roses’ and the English historic plays of Shakespeare in which the battles are mentioned.Decade Battle

Lancastrians King Edward IV King Henry VI Edward V Duke Somerset Richard III Henry VII Richard Neville Margaret of Anjou Earl of Salisbury Duke of Buckingham Duke of York Thomas Percy The Other Players Louis XI Charles the Bold King Henry VI (1421-1471)King Henry VI ruled England from 1422-1461 and then again from 1470-1471.It is claimed that Henry VI was apparently a saintly learned man,but he was a very bad king.He was pious and devoted to education,but lacked the governing or the military skills to run 15th century Britain.In 1445,Henry married Margaret of Anjou.Her favourites,Somerset and Buckingham ruled in all but name.In 1453,Henry had a mental breakdown,which allowed Richard,Duke of York,to step in as “Protector”.When Henry regained his sanity,he was urged by his wife and her favourites to throw York and his allies out of the Government.On May 22nd of that year,York and his allies began to take that Government back.King Edward IV (1442-1483)He ruled England from 1461-1470 and again from 1471-1483 In 1461,He was taken to Parliament by “The Kingmaker”,Richard Neville,and crowned king.They then headed north and engaged the Lancastrian army in the battle of Towton,the largest battle ever fought on English soil.Towton was a Yorkist victory and was the beginning of the end for the Lancastrians.Edward ruled for the next 9 years.Shakespeare’s English Historic Plays 193 Queen Margaret of Anjou (1429-1482)Margaret was married to Henry VI in 1445.Despite the King’s shyness and fear of women,he appears to have had a good marriage.With Henry’s mental state Margaret and her favourites to tried and hold the kingdom together.In 1471,her son was defeated and killed and she was imprisoned.She was eventually ransomed by Louis of France in exchange for her French lands.Until the death of her son,she was the backbone of the Lancastrian cause.King Edward V (1470-1483)-King Edward’s reign was very short,generally considered to be only part of the year 1483.He was eclipsed by the self proclaimed “Protector” of England and the Crown,Richard of Gloucester thereafter to become King Richard III.Edward and his brother were imprisoned in the Tower of London.It is generally accepted that Edward and his brother were murdered on the orders of Richard III.Duke of Somerset Edmund Beaufort,Duke of Somerset supported Henry and Queen Margaret during King Henry’s breakdown.Unfortunately,Beaufort had a private feud with the Nevilles.When York became Protector,Somerset found himself thrown out of court and into the Tower of London.When King Henry regained his sanity Somerset had a short-lived freedom.The Yorkists returned with an army and met the Lancastrians at St Albans in the first battle of the Wars of the Roses.The Yorkists were victorious.Somerset was hacked to death in front of the Castle Inn on May 22,1455.King Richard III (1452-1485)He reigned from 1483 until his death in 1485.Richard III is one of the most controversial rulers in the history of the British Isles.Sir Thomas More and Shakespeare portray him as evil incarnate.Richard came to power in 1483 probably fearing for his power and perhaps his life under a Woodville Monarchy.He was a successful administrator,but many in power mistrusted him.In 1485,at the battle of Bosworth Field,Richard was defeated and killed by the army of Henry Tudor who became King Henry VII.Serap Magill & Shahin Khalilli 194 Richard Neville the Earl of Warwick-428-1471’the Kingmaker’ Richard Neville has been called the last of the English Barons.He was a central figure in the Wars and could be considered to be a third party with the Lancastrians,Yorkists,and Nevilles.Richard Neville once held two Kings of England captive at the same time.Henry VI and Edward IV were both under his control in 1469.Henry Stafford,the 2nd Duke of Buckingham-(1454-1483)Stafford became duke in 1460 with the death of his father.When Edward IV died,Buckingham supported Richard III’s claim to the throne and was rewarded with the High Constableship of England.In the same year,however,he led a rebellion against Richard and was captured and executed for treason.Richard Plantagenet,Duke of York-(1411-1460)Richard Plantagenet,Duke of York father of Edward IV and Richard III.His claim to the throne was strong enough that he was heir to Henry VI until Henry produced a son.After the Battle of St Albans,Richard was again made heir to Henry disinheriting Edward of Lancaster.Queen Margaret did not accept that situation and by 1459,the two sides were at war.In 1461 at Wakefield,York was tricked into leaving his castle he and his forces were slaughtered by the Lancastrians.His son and Salisbury were also killed.Henry Tudor (1457-1509)The first of the Tudor kings.The Earl of Richmond (later Henry VII)defeated Richard III at Bosworth Fields on 22nd August 1485.Henry was born to Edmund Tudor and Margaret Beaufort.His father was killed before his birth when his mother was only 13.He spent 14 years in Wales and another 14 exiled in France before making his bid for the throne.In 1486,he married Elizabeth of York,Edward IV’s daughter and united the two houses of York and Lancaster.His reign lasted from 1485 to 1509 when the crown passed to his famous son,Henry VIII.Richard Neville (Earl of Salisbury)(About 1400-1460)The father of Richard Neville,Earl of Warwick.Salisbury was the eldest of the Yorkists.He was a capable war leader and was often Shakespeare’s English Historic Plays 195 the voice of reason.After success in the early part of the war,he was captured and beheaded after the battle of Wakefield.Louis XI-The King of France Louis XI ruled from 1461 until his death in 1483 and was known as the “Spider King”.Louis played a game of serious international intrigue in order to rebuild his country,which had been plagued by a century of war.In his 22 year reign,he showed a great understanding of changing politics and reclaimed the duchies of
