The experiments in this laboratory course are designed to cover the 
theoretical and analytical materials in “Electronics”. Each experiment begins 
with a set of stated objectives, text references, and required equipment, 
followed by a procedure for meeting each objective. The objective of the 
experiments is to enhance the students’ understanding of important analytical 
principles developed in this course by engaging them in the real-world 
application of these principles in the laboratory. In addition to further develop 
the students’ laboratory practice for experimentally testing and evaluating 
electrical circuits. 
Preparing the lab is very important as it will save time and allows 
working more efficiently. The pre-lab includes reading the lab assignment in 
advance, and doing the pre-lab assignment specific to each lab experiment. 
All pre-lab assignments have to be handed in with the main lab report at the 
beginning of the class. 
The manual is designed as an individualized learning package and 
involves the student in the activities of learning. Many illustrations and line 
drawings are used to familiarize the student with circuit recognition and 
analysis, since, this is an important part of being a good electronics 
technician.  
Each unit follows the same format so that the person using the book can 
become accustomed to the learning procedure. The basic experiments are 
given on how to test the device and verify its theory of operation. Fill-in 
questions are given at the end of each experiment to emphasize the important 
points gained from performing the experiment.  
This manual contains several appendixes at the end. The students is 
encouraged to become familiar with the contents of the appendixes early. 
Appendix A covers descriptions of important electrical units, abbreviations 
and symbols. Using the Metric System to Help Some Familiar Metrics is 
provided in Appendix B. 
The information about resistor and capacitor color coding is provided in 
Appendices C and D.  
Appendices E and F covers product descriptions and pin configuration of 
general purpose NPN/PNP transistors and N-/P-channel FET transistors. 
A list of useful electronics sites is provided in Appendix G.

Introduction 
The experiments in this manual do not use a voltage greater than 30V (or 
±15V); therefore, the chance of getting an electrical shock is greatly reduced. 
However, all voltages do have the potential to burn materials and start fires, to 
destroy electronic components, and present hazards to the person performing 
the operations. Common sense and an awareness of electrical circuits is 
important whenever you are working on these experiments. Before actual 
work is performed, sufficient instruction should be acquired in the proper use 
and safety requirements of all electronic devices. 
Current Hazards and Voltage Safety Precautions 
It takes a very small amount of current to pass through the human body 
from an electrical shock to injure a person severely or fatally. The 50-Hz 
current values affecting the human body are as follows: 
Current value Effects 
1 mA (0.001 A) Tingling or mild sensation. 
10 mA (0.01 A) A shock of sufficient intensity to cause involuntary 
control of muscles, so that a person cannot let go of an 
electrical conductor. 
100 mA (0.1 A) A shock of this type lasting for 1 second is sufficient to 
cause a crippling effect or even death. 
Over 100 mA An extremely severe shock that may cause ventricular 
fibrillation, where a change in the rhythm of the 
heartbeat causes death almost instantaneously. 
The resistance of the human body varies from about 500,000 Ω when dry 
to about 300 Ω when wet (including the effects of perspiration). In this case, 
voltages as low as 30 V can cause sufficient current to be fatal (I=voltage / 
wet resistance=30 V/300 Ω=100 mA). 
Even though the actual voltage of a circuit being worked on is low 
enough not to present a very hazardous situation, the equipment being used 
to power and test the circuit (i.e., power supply, signal generator, meters, 
oscilloscopes) is usually operated on 220 V AC. To minimize the chance of 
getting shocked, a person should use only one hand while making voltage 
measurements, keeping the other hand at the side of the body, in the lap, or 
behind the body. Do not defeat the safety feature (fuse, circuit breaker, 
interlock switch) of any electrical device by shorting across it or by using a 
higher amperage rating than that specified by the manufacturer. These safety 
devices are intended to protect both the user and the equipment.

Neat Working Area 
A neat working area requires a careful and deliberate approach when 
setting it up. Test equipment and tools should be set out on the workbench in 
a neat and orderly manner. Connecting wires from the test equipment to the 
circuit under test should be placed so as not to interfere with testing 
procedures. 
Before power is applied to a circuit, the area around the circuit should be 
cleared of extra wires, components, hand tools, and debris (cut wire and 
insulation). 
In Case of Electrical Shock 
When a person comes in contact with an electrical circuit of sufficient 
voltage to cause shock, certain steps should be taken as outlined in the 
following procedure: 
1.  Quickly remove the victim from the source of electricity by means of a 
switch, circuit breaker, pulling the cord, or cutting the wires with a well-
insulated tool. 
2.  It may be faster to separate the victim from the electrical circuit by using 
a dry stick, rope, leather belt, coat, blanket, or any other nonconducting 
material. 
CAUTION: Do not touch the victim or the electrical circuit unless the 
power is off. 
3.  Call for assistance, since other persons may be more knowledgeable in 
treating the victim or can call for professional medical help while first aid 
is being given.  
4.  Check the victim’s breathing and heartbeat.  
5.  If breathing has stopped but the victim's pulse is detectable, give mouth-
to-mouth resuscitation until medical help arrives. 
6.  If the heartbeat has stopped, use cardiopulmonary resuscitation, but only 
if you are trained in the proper technique. 
7.  If both breathing and heartbeat have stopped, alternate between mouth-
to-mouth resuscitation and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (but only if you 
are trained). 
8.  Use blankets or coats to keep the victim warm and raise the legs slightly 
above head level to help prevent shock. 
9.  If the victim has burns, cover your mouth and nostrils with gauze or a 
clean handkerchief to avoid breathing germs on the victim and then wrap 
the burned areas of the victim firmly with sterile gauze or a clean cloth. 
10.  In any case, do not just stand there – do something within your ability to 
give the victim some first aid.

INSTRUCTIONS FOR    
ELECTRONICS LABORATORY  
Organization  
The laboratory work is a group activity. Students will be divided into 
groups of two or three. All members of a group are expected to be present and 
participate in conducting an experiment with as much equal contribution as 
possible. All members of a group are expected to come prepared, and 
complete the work within the scheduled laboratory period with their 
laboratory partners. No individual member and no individual group will be 
allowed to do an experiment outside the scheduled times except under 
extenuating circumstances and only with the consent of the instructor.  
Purpose and Procedure  
The purpose of this course is to cultivate in the student a degree of 
independence in carrying out an engineering task. The burden (and reward) of 
success is the student's, not the instructor’s.  
The student will perform specific electronic experiments as indicated by 
handouts for each experiment. These handouts are generally specific but leave 
much room for independent approaches. In the lectures background and 
motivating material and a certain degree of guidance for the experiments will 
be given; but the exact experimental set-up or diagrams will not be given. This 
is the responsibility of the student. The instructor (or the teaching assistant of 
the laboratory session) may give a moderate degree of specific guidance, 
mainly by asking the student pertinent questions to direct the student onto a 
correct path. He will do this only after the student has demonstrated 
substantial serious effort to solve the problem. The student should not expect 
to receive from the lab instructor exact circuit diagrams. The instructor will, 
however, point out errors in diagrams or hook-ups as far as this can 
reasonably be done. The grade given to the student for the experiment will 
partly depend on the degree of independence of the student. If everything else 
fails, the instructor will provide a good diagram, but this will be done at a 
severe penalty in the grading.  
Contrary to popular belief, most of the work must be done by the student 
before he or she comes to the laboratory. One should study the problems 
using common sense and any required textbooks and/or reference books. One 
must prepare a complete procedure for the experimental work including 
alternatives and must know what components and equipment are needed and 
allow for substitution if the first choice is not available. One must study the 
E l e c r t r o n i c s  
 9 
problem before coming to the laboratory so that the general trend of results is 
anticipated. This will make it possible to recognize "nonsense" results and 
correct the experimental procedure. Unnoticed wrong results will be 
considered worse than incomplete results in the grading, since the theory and 
the laboratory is available to the student to validate results.  
Each student must have a laboratory manual. The manual will contain the 
preliminary work done as well as the complete work plan for the experiment. 
It will also contain every test and check made, all in-lab computations, 
modifications of circuit or procedure, and results. The instructor may examine 
the work done and grade the preliminary during the lab periods.  
A concise, but complete, neatly prepared final report for each experiment 
by each member of the group must be handed in to the instructor within one 
week after the completion of the experiment. It is expected that the circuits, 
design calculations and data to be the same for two reports written by the 
members of the same group. But, this cannot be used to justify near identical 
reports to be submitted. Particularly, discussions, comments, conclusions and 
the overall style should reflect individual contribution and originality. A good 
presentation is clear, concise, and informative. It makes good use of graphics, 
has good writing style and presents ideas in a nice logical sequence.  
Some longer experiments will be allowed to be completed in two weeks. 
A quiz may be given at the beginning of each experiment. The instructor will 
give some overall guidance at the beginning. The work plans will be checked 
in the laboratory and graded.  
In summary the student’s endeavors will include:  
1. Preparation of work plans for each experiment based on independent 
reading and analysis, and lecture suggestions.  
2. Preparation for and taking of lab quizzes. (Note that preparation of a good 
work plan will aid in quiz preparation.  
3. Conducting of the actual experiments in the laboratory.  
4. Preparation of a final report for each experiment.  
Grading  
Grades will be assigned over the following categories with the indicated 
weights (approximately):  
Lab reports:  
25% Preliminary work/design  
50% Experiment and participation  
25% Discussions/Conclusions  
NO LAB EXPERIMENT OR ITS REPORT MAY BE SKIPPED.  
LATE REPORTS LOSE 50% PER WEEK, COMPOUNDED.

Equipment Handling  
Never take for granted that the equipment or components are in good 
condition. Always check all equipment before you start the experiment. Make 
certain the power supply has ripple free output voltage and that the 
oscilloscope has the correct gain in the ranges of interest. Check all diodes 
and transistors with an ohm-meter. Make sure resistors and potentiometers are 
close to the indicated value. Make sure that capacitors are not shorted, nor 
opened. In case of equipment failure, keep the malfunctioning equipment on 
your bench; do not swap equipment from other benches. Equipment sets are 
assigned to groups. Do not attempt to repair malfunctioning equipment. Do 
not even replace fuses. Call the lab instructor/technician for appropriate 
action.  
General Tips  
When something doesn’t work as you expect, be skeptical about all facets 
of your design, fabrication and test of the circuit. Although test equipment 
may fail from time to time, problems are almost always due to errors in 
design, documentation or wiring; faulty components occasionally; or a 
misunderstanding of how to use the test equipment. In the laboratory the 
experimenter interacts with natural phenomena which tend to be brutally 
honest and unforgiving in evaluating a poorly thought out experiment.  
Group interactions can be difficult; but Engineering is inherently a 
discipline requiring much team effort. Thus, the skills developed in working 
effectively in a grouped environment are quite important. It is the 
responsibility of each student to create an effective group where everyone 
contributes substantially.

OBJECTIVES 
1. To understand the operation and use of an oscilloscope 
2. To learn to measure DC and AC voltages with the oscilloscope 
3. To use an oscilloscope to observe repetitive time varying waveforms 
4. To use a function generator to create repetitive waveforms 
 
BASIC INFORMATION 
The Oscilloscope 
The oscilloscope or “scope” as it is better known is one of the most 
versatile pieces of laboratory test equipment (Fig. 1.1). It is really a type of 
analog voltmeter with an arbitrary zero. It can read DC voltages as an offset 
voltage and as well as AC voltages by displaying the true wave form. Most 
modern oscilloscopes are capable of measuring AC signals over a wide range 
of frequencies. 
The heart of the oscilloscope is the cathode ray tube, which generates the 
electron beam, accelerates the beam to a high velocity, deflects the beam to 
create the image, and contains the phosphor screen where the electron beam 
eventually becomes visible. The electrons are called cathode rays because 
they are emitted by the cathode and this gives the oscilloscope its full name of 
cathode ray oscilloscope (CRO) or cathode ray tube (CRT) oscilloscope (Fig. 
1.2). The electron beam emitted by the heated cathode at the rear end of the 
tube is accelerated and focused by one or more anodes, and strikes the front 
of the tube, producing a bright spot on the phosphorescent screen.

The heart of the oscilloscope is the cathode ray tube, which generates the 
electron beam, accelerates the beam to a high velocity, deflects the beam to 
create the image, and contains the phosphor screen where the electron beam 
eventually becomes visible. The electrons are called cathode rays because 
they are emitted by the cathode and this gives the oscilloscope its full name of 
cathode ray oscilloscope (CRO) or cathode ray tube (CRT) oscilloscope (Fig. 
1.2). The electron beam emitted by the heated cathode at the rear end of the 
tube is accelerated and focused by one or more anodes, and strikes the front 
of the tube, producing a bright spot on the phosphorescent screen. 
The electron beam is bent, or deflected, by voltages applied to two sets of 
plates fixed in the tube. The horizontal deflection plates, or X-plates produce 
side to side movement. As you can see, they are linked to a system block 
called the time base. This produces a sawtooth waveform. During the rising 
phase of the sawtooth, the spot is driven at a uniform rate from left to right 
across the front of the screen. During the falling phase, the electron beam 
returns rapidly from right or left, but the spot is “blanked out” so that nothing 
appears on the screen. 
Although the oscilloscope can eventually be used to display practically 
any parameter, the input to the oscilloscope is voltage. In this way, the time 
base generates the X-axis of the V/t graph. The general laboratory oscilloscope 
can accept as low as a few millivolts per centimeter of deflection up to 
hundred of volts using the built-in attenuator and external probes.

E l e c r t r o n i c s

The slope of the rising phase varies with the frequency of the sawtooth 
and can be adjusted, using the TIME/DIV control, to change the scale of the X-
axis. Dividing the oscilloscope screen into squares allows the horizontal scale 
to be expressed in seconds, milliseconds or microseconds per division (s/DIV, 
ms/DIV, µs/DIV). Alternatively, if the squares are 1 cm apart, the scale may be 
given as s/cm, ms/cm or µs/cm. 
The vertical input also will have a switch for AC or DC input signals. 
When the AC/DC switch is in the DC position, the probe is connected directly 
to the Y-amplifier. When the switch is in the AC position, there is a coupling 
capacitor between the probe and the amplifiers. The reason to allow the 
measurement of low-level AC signals which may be on the same wire as a 
high-level DC voltage. If the probe is connected directly to the amplifiers, the 
scope trace moves on the scale an amount equal to the voltage applied. If this 
voltage is a high voltage, say 100 V the vertical attenuator must be set to an 
insensitive position in order for the trace not to be deflected beyond the 
viewable portion of the screen. With the vertical sensitivity thus set, a small 
AC signal on the same wire could not be measured, when the vertical input 
switch is in the AC position, a capacitor blocks the direct current from 
reaching the amplifiers. With the direct current blocked, the vertical sensitivity 
can be set so the AC signal can be easily seen and measured. 
The Y-amplifier is linked in turn to a pair of Y-plates so that it provides the 
Y-axis of the V/t graph. The overall gain of the Y-amplifier can be adjusted,

using the VOLTS/DIV control, so that the resulting display is neither too small 
nor too large, but fits the screen and can be seen clearly. The vertical scale is 
usually given in V/DIV or mV/DIV. 
The trigger circuit is used to delay the time base waveform so that the 
same section of the input signal is displayed on the screen each time the spot 
moves across. The effect of this is to give a stable picture on the oscilloscope 
screen, making it easier to measure and interpret the signal. 
Changing the scales of the X-axis and Y-axis allows many different signals 
to be displayed. Sometimes, it is also useful to be able to change 
the positions of the axes. This is possible using the X-POS and Y-POS controls. 
For example, with no signal applied, the normal trace is a straight line across 
the centre of the screen. Adjusting Y-POS allows the zero level on the Y-axis 
to be changed, moving the whole trace up or down on the screen to give an 
effective display of signals like pulse waveforms which do not alternate 
between positive and negative values. 
A dual trace oscilloscope can display two traces on the screen, allowing 
you to easily compare the input and output of an amplifier for example. The 
dual trace oscilloscope provides for amplification and display of two signals at 
the same time, thereby permitting direct comparison of the signals on the CRT 
screen (measure the phase displacement of two waveforms, and so on). 
Front Panel Controls Front panel controls permit you to control the 
operation of the oscilloscope. They may be grouped functionally as: 
Main Oscilloscope Controls According to Function 
Display Vertical Horizontal Triggering 
Intensity Coupling (AC-Ground-DC) Time base (Sec/Div) Coupling 
Focus Volts/Div X-position Source

The above function set is summarized for a typical oscilloscope only. The 
oscilloscope in the laboratory that you will be using may have more functions. 
For detail operation of the oscilloscope, you should refer to the user’s manual 
of the oscilloscope. 
 
E l e c r t r o n i c s

Connecting the oscilloscope to the circuit under test 
The input impedance of an oscilloscope is rather high, being on the order 
of 1 MΩ, which is desirable for measuring voltages in high impedance 
circuits. The attenuator sets the sensitivity of the oscilloscope in the common 
1-2-5 sequence. As an example, the input attenuator could provide for 10, 20, 
50, 100, 200 mV, etc., per centimeter. The input attenuator must provide the 
correct 1-2-5 sequence attenuation while maintaining a constant input 
impedance, as well as maintaining both the input impedance and attenuation 
over the frequency range for which the oscilloscope was designed. 
The oscilloscope is connected to the circuit under test by means of a 
probe (or set of probes) as illustrated in Fig. 1.3. The probe includes a 
measurement tip and a ground clip and connects to the oscilloscope by a BNC 
connector via a flexible, shielded cable which is grounded at the oscilloscope. 
This ground serves as the reference point with respect to which all signals are 
measured.  The shield helps guard electrical noise pick up.  
Voltage Measurements A screen is divided into centimeter divisions in 
the vertical and horizontal directions. The vertical sensitivity is provided (or 
set) in volts/cm, while the horizontal sensitivity is provided (or set) in time 
(s/cm). The magnitude of the signal can be determined from the following 
equation: 
Signal voltage Vs = voltage sensitivity (V/cm) × deflection (cm) 
If a particular signal occupies 6 vertical centimeters and the vertical sensi-
tivity is 5 mV/cm, signal voltage Vs = (5 mV/cm) (6 cm) = 30 mV.      
 
 
Sometimes an attenuator probe is used to expand the range of the scope. 
This probe has a high-value resistor in it which acts as a voltage divider with 
the scope input resistance. As a result, whatever voltage is read on the scope 
Fig. 1.3.  Connection of the oscilloscope to the circuit under test 
 
K h a l i l   I s m a i l o v

graticule must be multiplied by 10. Such a probe is called a “times 10,” or 
×10, probe. 
The simplest AC signal is the sine wave and you should use this function 
as your first AC source. When this signal is connected to the oscilloscope, you 
can see that you can easily measure the peak AC voltage, Vp, which is defined 
as the voltage measured from the center or zero position to the peak (see Fig. 
1.4). There are several other voltages that can also be measured. The peak-to-
peak voltage, Vp-p, is the voltage measured from the crest of one cycle to the 
bottom trough of the cycle or peak-to-peak. Finally, the most common voltage 
is the rms or root-mean-square voltage, Vrms. It is equal to the peak-to-peak 
value divided by (2×1.414). For the sine wave only: 
rmsppp V22/VV == −  
A one volt rms waveform has the same heating value as a one volt DC 
signal.  
Time Period Measurements   Time is shown on the horizontal X-axis and 
the scale is determined by the TIMEBASE (TIME/DIV) control. The time period 
(often just called period) is the time for one cycle of the signal. The frequency 
is the number of cycles per second, frequency = 1/time period. 
 
 
Ensure that the variable timebase control is click-stopped fully clockwise 
before attempting to take a time reading.  
Time = distance in cm × time/cm 
For example, if time period=4.0cm×5 ms/cm=20ms then frequency= 
=1/time period=1/20ms=50 Hz.

Functional descriptions of an oscilloscope OS-5020: 
Coupling (AC-GND-DC): Permits selection of coupling of the input 
channel.   
 When set to DC, the entire signal (AC plus any DC components) is 
displayed.   
 When set to AC, DC signals are blocked by a capacitor and only AC 
is displayed.   
 When set to ground, the input channel is isolated from the input 
source and is grounded internally.   
VOLTS/DIV: This is the scope’s vertical sensitivity control. It is a 
calibrated control that establishes how many volts each major vertical scale 
division represents. For example, when it is set for 1 V/DIV, each grid line 
represents 1 volt. Each channel has its own independent VOLTS/DIV control. 
CAL.: This is the fine adjust control, usually located in the inner of the 
VOLTS/DIV knob.  When this knob is turned to the fully clockwise direction, 
it is at the calibrated location (the normal position of this knob) for the outer 
knob setting, i.e., the vertical scale of the scope is defined by the VOLTS/DIV 
knob. When the CAL. knob is turned away from the calibrated position, the 
waveform displayed in the scope will start to be attenuated.  
Vertical POSITION: This is the vertical position control. Each channel 
has its own control. It moves the trace up or down for easier observation.  It is 
not calibrated. 
Channel Select: Permits displaying CH1, CH2, both channels, their sum 
or difference. 
Timebase (V MODE): This is a calibrated control that selects how many 
seconds each major horizontal division represents. It is calibrated in s, ms, 
and µs. One control handles all channels.  There is also CAL. knob for the 
time base. The CAL. knob is located at the inner of the TIME/DIV knob. Its 
operation is similar to that of the previous one for the VOLTS/DIV. 
Magnification: For both CAL. knobs of the VOLTS/DIV and TIME/DIV, 
the CAL. Knob also acts as the magnification switch. The magnification is ×5 
or ×10 with the knob pulled out. 
Horizontal POSITION: Positions the trace horizontally. One control 
handles all channels. 
Trigger Source:  Selects the trigger source, e.g., CH1, CH2, an external 
trigger, or the AC power line. 
Trigger Level: Permits you to adjust the point on the trigger source 
waveform where you like the triggering to start. 
K h a l i l   I s m a i l o v 
 18 
Trigger Slope: Selects whether the scope is to trigger on the positive or 
negative slope of the trigger source waveform. 
Trigger Mode: Modes include  
 AUTO – the sweep always occurs, even with no trigger present,  
 NORMAL – a trigger must be present, and  
 SINGLE SWEEP – a trigger is required but only one sweep results. 
INTENSITY: Adjusts the intensity of the displayed beam. 
FOCUS: Adjusts the sharpness of the displayed beam. 
AUTO: Some oscilloscopes with electronic control are fitted with a 
button which automatically selects an appropriate timebase, triggering mode 
and horizontal gain. 
Function Generator 
The function generator is a supply that typically provides a sinusoidal, 
square-wave, and triangular waveforms for a range of frequencies and 
amplitudes. Although the frequency of the function generator can be set by 
the dial position and appropriate multiplier, the oscilloscope can be used to 
precisely set the output frequency. The scope can also be used to set the 
amplitude of the function generator since most function generators simply 
have an amplitude control with no level indicators. 
The model FG-8002 (Fig. 1.5) is an advanced function generator which 
provides functions of function generator, pulse generator and sweep oscillator 
including following versatile features: 
-  Wide frequency range from 0.02 Hz to 2 MHz. 
-  Versatile waveforms are selectable in sine wave, square wave. Triangle 
wave and pulse wave, etc. 
-  TTL level square wave output is available for signal source for digital 
circuit experiments.  
-  Variable symmetry to generate sawtooth and pulse waveform 
-  Frequency of output signal can be controlled by applying voltage from 
0 to +10 V to VCF IN connector. 
-  The linear sweep function provides SWEEP FUNCTION CONTROL 
from 1:1 to 100:1. 
-  DC voltage from 0 to +10 V can be overload upon output waveform 
-  Maximum attenuation over 40 dB.

SUMMARY 
1. The most common scope in use today is the triggered-sweep scope. 
Older scopes were the recurrent sweep type. 
2. The typical scope has four sections: vertical; horizontal; trigger, or 
sync; and display. 
3. The vertical section of the scope conditions the input and causes the 
beam in the CRT to be deflected vertically. 
4. The horizontal section of the scope controls the horizontal sweep of 
the CRT electron beam. It causes the beam to sweep at an accurate 
rate, so frequency can be calculated from the sweep time. 
5. The trigger section of the scope controls how the beam is synchronized 
with the incoming signal to cause the waveform to be stable. 
6. The display section of the scope controls brightness, focus, etc. 
7. The scope has controls to allow adjustment of vertical sensitivity, 
vertical and horizontal beam position, etc. 
8. The AC-DC switch allows the display of either AC or DC signals. 
9. The function generator typically provides a sinusoidal, square-wave, and 
triangular waveform for a range of frequencies and amplitudes. 
10. Advanced function generator provides functions of function generator, 
pulse generator and sweep oscillator.

• Variable DC power supply (GP-4303TP) 
• Function generator (FG-8002) 
PROCEDURE 
Setting up an oscilloscope 
Before placing the instrument in use, set up and check the instrument as 
follows: 
1.  Set the following controls as indicated. 
POWER Switch     OFF (released) 
INTEN Control     Mid rotation 
FOCUS Control     Mid rotation  
AC/GND/DC Switch    DC 
VOLTS/DIV Switch   10 mV

Trigger MODE Switch   AUTO 
Trigger SOURCE Switch   VERT 
Trigger LEVEL Control    Mid rotation 
SLOPE Switch     Button out 
2.  Press the POWER Switch. 
The POWER lamp should light immediately. About 30 seconds later, 
rotate the INTEN. Control clockwise until the trace appears on the CRT 
screen. Adjust brightness to your liking. 
3.  Turn the FOCUS Control for a sharp trace. 
4.  Turn the CH1 Vertical POSITION Control to move the CH1 trace to the 
center horizontal graticule line. 
5.  See if the trace is precisely parallel with the graticule line. 
6.  Turn the Horizontal POSITION Control to align the left edge of the trace 
with the left most graticule line. 
7.  Set one of the supplied probes (Fig. 1.6) for ×10 attenuation. Then, 
connect its BNC end to the CH1 or X IN Connector. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Scope probes are available with ×1 attenuation (direct connection) and 
×10 attenuation. The ×10 attenuator probes increase the effective input 
impedance of the probe/scope combination to 10 megohms shunted by a few 
picofarads, the reduction in input capacitance is the most important reason for 
using attenuator probes at high frequencies, where capacitance is the major 
factor in loading down a circuit and distorting the signal. When ×10 
attenuator probes are used, the scale factor (VOLTS/DIV switch setting) must 
be multiplied by ten.

Single-trace Operation   The OS-5020 is set up for single-trace operation 
as follows: 
1.  Set the following controls as indicated below. Note that the trigger source 
selected (CH1 or CH2 SOURCE) must match the single channel selected. 
(CH1 or CH2 V-MODE) 
 POWER switch   ON (pushed in)  
 AC/GND/DC switches   AC 
 Vertical POSITION controls Mid rotation  
 VARIABLE controls   Fully CW 
 V MODE switch  CH1 (CH2)  
 VARIABLE control   CAL 
 Trigger MODE switch   AUTO 
 Trigger SOURCE switch   VERT 
 Trigger LEVEL control   Mid rotation 
2.  Use the corresponding Vertical POSITION control or to set the trace near 
mid screen. 
3.  Connect the signal to be observed to the corresponding IN connector and 
adjust the corresponding VOLTS/DIV switch or so the displayed signal is 
totally on screen. 
CAUTION>  
  Do not apply a signal greater than 400 V (DC + peak AC) 
4.  Set the TIME/DIV switch so the desired number of signal cycles are 
displayed. Adjust the Trigger LEVEL control if necessary for a stable 
display. 
5.  If the signal you wish to observe is either DC or low enough in frequency, 
the AC coupling will attenuate or distort the signal. So, flip the AC/GND/DC 
switch or to DC. 
Dual-trace Operation   Dual trace operation is the major operating mode 
of the OS-5020. The setup for dual trace operation is identical to that of single 
trace operation with the following exceptions: 
1.  Set the V MODE switch to either DUAL. Select ALT for relatively high 
frequency signals (TIME/DIV switch set to 0.5 ms or faster). Select CHOP 
for relatively low frequency signals (TIME/DIV switch set to 1 ms or 
slower). 
2.  If both channels are displayed in signals of the same frequency, set the 
Trigger SOURCE switch to the channel having the steepest-slope waveform. 
If the signals are different but harmonically related, trigger from the channel 
carrying the lowest frequency. Also, remember that if you disconnect the 
channel serving as the trigger source, the entire display will free run.

Setting up a Function Generator 
1.  Pressing POWER Switch turns on power. POWER Lamp light up when 
power is on. 
2.  Connect BNC end of the clip probe to the OUTPUT 50 Ω BNC socket. 
The lead is connected with a push and twist action, to disconnect you 
need to twist and pull. 
3.  Push on of three knobs of FUNCTION Selector to get a desired waveform 
out of sine wave, triangle wave and square wave. 
4.  Amplitude of output signal can be controlled by AMPLITUDE/PULL–20 
dB knob. Maximum attenuation is more than 20 dB when the knob is 
rotated fully counterclockwise. Pulling this knob makes attenuation of 20 
dB, so the output signal can be attenuated by 40 dB when this is pulled 
and rotated fully counterclockwise. 
5.  Frequency range (Seven ranges: 1 – 0.02 Hz to 2 Hz, 10 – 2 Hz to 20 
Hz, 100 – 20 Hz to 200 Hz, 1k – 200 Hz to 2 kHz, 10k – 2 kHz to 20 
kHz, 100k – 20 kHz to 200 kHz, 1M – 200 kHz to 2 MHz,) is selected 
by FREQUENCY RANGE Selector. Output frequency within the selected 
range is varied by the Frequency Dial potentiometer. 
6.  Sweep width is controlled by SWEEP WIDTH/PULL ON Control. Pulling 
the knob selects internal sweep and rotating it controls sweep width. 
Rotate it counterclockwise to get a minimum sweep width (1:1) and 
rotate it clockwise to get a maximum sweep width (100:1). To get a 
maximum sweep width, set the frequency dial to minimum scale (below 
0.2 scale).    
7.  Sweep rate (sweep frequency) of internal sweep oscillator is controlled by 
SWEEP RATE Control. 
8.  Symmetry (duty cycle) of output signal waveform within range of 10:1 to 
1:10 is controlled by SYMMETRY Control.  
9.  The DC OFFSET control knob may be used to offset the waveform above 
or below ground (0 volts) by a DC voltage in the range ±10 volts. To 
adjust the DC level pull out the OFFSET control knob then turn slowly 
CW (positive volts) or CCW (negative volts). If the OFFSET knob is pushed 
in, there is no DC level, but only AC voltage exists in the output signal.  
Measurements 
1. Plug the power cable of the oscilloscope into the socket outlet in the 
bench. 
2. Practice setting up the scope to get a trace on the screen. Move the trace 
around. Work with all the controls until you understand their functions.

QUESTIONS 
1. Is the time-base setting important when you are measuring direct current? 
Explain. 
2. How the magnitude of the signal is determined when you take 
measurements of voltage from the screen? 
3. If the vertical sensitivity is increased, it takes more signal to deflect the 
beam (true/false). 
Answers to Self-Test 
1. To make the beam sweep across the CRT at a regular, predictable rate. 
This, in turn, allows for accurate frequency measurements. 
2. If there is any direct current on the same line with the low-level 
alternating current and the scope is set in the DC position, the trace may 
be detected off the screen. To keep the trace on the screen, the vertical 
attenuator must be set so insensitively as to make the low-level alternating 
current  immeasurable. 
3. To make smaller. 
4. Vertical, horizontal, sync, and display. 
5. Sinusoidal, square-wave, and triangular waveforms for a range of 
frequencies and amplitudes.

EXPERIMENT 2.1 
TESTING SEMICONDUCTOR DIODES 
OBJECTIVE  
• To demonstrate a practical method of testing diodes with an ohmmeter. 
This is called a go/no go test. 
When p- and n-type silicon are joined as shown in Fig. 2.1, a junction 
diode is created. This two element device has a unique characteristic: the 
ability to pass current readily in only one direction. 
 
 
 
 
Connection of a negative battery terminal to the n-type and the positive 
battery terminal to the p-type silicon results in correct low and is called 
forward bias. Electrons and holes are repelled toward the p-n junction, where 
they recombine to form neutral charges and are replaced by free electrons 
(negative charges) from the battery. This movement of charges maintains a 
high forward current through the diode in the form of free electrons passing 
from the n material through the junction and the p material, toward the 
positive terminal of the battery. Because current flows in this connection, the 
diode is said to have a low forward resistance. 
The reverse-bias connection is shown in Fig. 2.2. The positive terminal of 
the battery attracts free electrons in the n-type silicon away from the p-n 
junction. The negative terminal of the battery attracts the holes in the p-type 
DIODE CHARACTERISTICS 2 EXPERIMENT

away from the p-n junction. Hence there are no combinations of free electrons 
and holes. Thus the majority current carriers in the diode do not support 
current flow. In this reverse-bias configuration, there is a minute current in the 
diode. This current is due to the minority carriers, that is, the holes in the n-
type and free electrons in the p-type. For the minority carriers, battery polarity 
is correct to support current flow. Only a few microamperes of current flow as 
a result of the minority carriers. This is shown by the dotted arrows in Fig. 2.2. 
The reverse-bias connection results in a high reverse resistance in the diode. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Most modern-day digital multimeters (DMM) can be used to determine 
the condition of a diode. They have a scale denoted by a diode symbol that 
will indicate the condition of a diode in the forward and reverse-bias regions. 
If connected to establish a forward-bias condition the meter will display the 
forward voltage across the diode at a current level typically in the neighborhood 
of 2 mA. If connected to establish a reverse-bias condition an “OL” or “1” should 
appear on the display to support the open-circuit approximation frequently 
applied to this region. If the meter does not have the diode-checking 
capability the condition of the diode can also be checked by obtaining some 
measure of the resistance level in the forward and reverse-bias regions.  
A DMM as an ohmmeter has a low-voltage potential placed at its leads 
when measuring resistance. One lead is positive (usually red in color) and the 
other lead is negative (usually black in color). When the positive lead is 
placed on the anode of a diode and the negative lead on the cathode (usually 
marked by a circular band), this forward resistance (RF) should be low, since 
the diode is forward biased. When the leads are reversed, the reverse 
resistance (RR) should be high, since the diode is reverse biased. This simple 
go/no go test can determine if the diode is open or shorted. 
Resistance measurements will vary with different types of diodes, but a 
high-to-low ratio of 10:1 for rectifier diodes is acceptable, while a 100:1 ratio 
is considered good for switching diodes. A shorted diode will show low-
resistance readings in both directions and an open diode will show high 
resistance (infinity) in both directions. 
Using the connection in Fig. 2.3, constant-current source of about 2 mA 
internal to the meter will forward bias the junction, and a voltage in the

neighborhood of 0.7 V (700 mV) should be obtained for silicon and 0.3 V 
(300 mV) for germanium. If leads are reversed, an “OL” or “1” indication 
should be obtained. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
If a low reading (less than 1 V) is obtained in both directions, the junction 
is shorted internally. If an “OL” or “1” indication is obtained in both directions, 
the junction is open.

EXPERIMENT 2.2 
THE DIODE AS A SWITCH 
OBJECTIVE 
• To show how to recognize a conducting and nonconducting diode by its 
circuit voltage drops, and to determine the forward current. 
Because of its characteristics of high resistance in one direction and low 
resistance in the other, the diode has many uses in modern electronic circuits. 
Since it has low resistance when forward-biased, it can be considered an ON 
switch when so biased. Likewise, having a high resistance when reverse-
biased, the diode can be considered an OFF switch when it is reverse-biased. 
In an ideal situation, the switch has 0-Ω resistance when on and infinite 
resistance when off. The diode does have some resistance when forward-
biased, and so it does have a voltage drop across it. And, when reverse-biased, 
the diode will allow some current flow because it does not have an infinite 
resistance. Yet, for most uses these characteristics are well within a range to 
allow the diode to be used effectively as an electronic switch. 
Referring to Fig. 2.5a, note that a forward-biased silicon diode will have a 
voltage drop of 0.7 V across it with the remaining power supply voltage 
dropped across the load resistor (RL). The voltage drop of RL can be found by 
the formula VL = VDD – VD. The forward current (IF) through the circuit can be 
found by the formula ID = VL/RL. Referring to Fig. 2.5b, note that a reverse-
biased silicon diode will have the total power supply voltage dropped across 
it, while the voltage drop across the load resistor will be zero, since no current 
is flowing in the circuit. 
MATERIALS NEEDED

• (1) Digital Multimeter (DMM) 
• (1) 1-kΩ resistor at 0.5 W

EXPERIMENT 2.3 
CURRENT-VOLTAGE CHARACTERISTICS OF A DIODE 
OBJECTIVE 
• To demonstrate the relationships of forward voltage, current, and resistance 
of a diode and the reverse voltage, current, and resistance also. 
The characteristics of a silicon or germanium diode have the general shape 
shown in Fig. 2.6. Note the change in scale for both the vertical and horizontal 
axes. In the reverse-biased region the reverse saturation currents are fairly 
constant from 0 V to the Zener potential (VZ). In the forward-bias region the 
current increases quite rapidly with increasing diode voltage. Note that the 
curve is rising almost vertically at a forward-biased voltage of less than 1 V. The 
forward-biased diode current will be limited solely by the network in which the 
diode is connected or by the maximum current or power rating of the diode. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The forward resistance of a conducting diode can be found by the Ohm’s 
law calculation RF = VF/IF. The voltage across the entire circuit can increase to 
several volts, while the external load resistor (RL) mainly determines the 
current flowing in the circuit. In the reverse-biased condition there is very little 
current (µA) flow, and hence the reverse resistance is high. The reverse 
resistance of a diode can be found by Ohm’s law calculation: 
RR = VR/IR 
The “firing potential” or threshold voltage VT is determined by extending 
a straight line (dashed lines of Fig. 2.6) tangent to the curves until it hits the 
horizontal axis. The intersection with the VD axis will determine the threshold 
voltage VT.

EXPERIMENT 3.1  
HALF-WAVE RECTIFICATION 
OBJECTIVE 
• To observe and measure the output waveforms of a half-wave rectifier. 
BASIC INFORMATION 
Most electronic equipment requires direct current to operate. Because it 
is more efficient and economical to transmit, AC power is generally distributed 
by the power utility companies. Therefore, it must be changed to direct current 
before the electronic equipment can be operated. Normally this change from 
alternating to direct current takes place inside each peace of equipment and is 
done by a power supply.  
The diode, because of its one-way conduction characteristic, is ideal to 
change alternating to direct current. A circuit used to change alternating 
current to direct current is called a rectifier circuit. The term rectify, when it is 
used in electronics, means to change alternating to direct current. There are 
two different rectification circuits, known as half-wave and full-wave rectifiers. 
The primary function of half-wave and full-wave rectification systems is to 
establish a DC level from a sinusoidal input signal that has zero average (DC) 
level. Almost all rectifiers comprise a number of diodes in a specific 
arrangement for more efficiently converting AC to DC than is possible with 
just a single diode.  
HALF-WAVE and 
FULL-WAVE RECTIFICATION 3 EXPERIMENT 
E l e c r t r o n i c s  
 39 
Half-wave rectifier allows one half of an AC waveform to pass through to 
the load (Fig. 3.1). 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
During each positive half cycle of the AC sine wave, the diode is 
forward-biased and current flows through it. Since the DC load is resistive 
(resistor RL), the current flowing in the load resistor is therefore proportional 
to the voltage and the voltage across the load resistor is the same as the 
supply voltage, vs (minus VD), that is the DC voltage across the load is 
sinusoidal for the first half cycle only. 
During each negative half cycle of the AC sine wave, the diode is 
reverse-biased and no current flows through it. Therefore, in the negative half 
cycle of the supply, no current flows in the load resistor as no voltage appears 
across it. Then v0 = 0 V. 
The current on the DC side of the circuit flows in one direction only 
making the circuit unidirectional (Fig. 3.2) and an average or equivalent DC 
level equal to 31.8% of the peak value Vm. That is, 
   wavehalfmDC V318.0V −=    (3.1)  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
For most power applications, half-wave rectification is insufficient for the 
task. The harmonic content of the rectifier’s output waveform is very large 
and consequently difficult to filter. Furthermore, the AC power source only 
supplies power to the load one half every full cycle, meaning that half of its 
capacity is unused.

EXPERIMENT 3.2  
FULL-WAVE RECTIFICATION 
OBJECTIVE 
• To observe and measure the output waveforms of a full-wave rectifier. 
 BASIC INFORMATION 
More efficiency is gained if both halves of the input sine wave can be 
used. This is done in full-wave rectification where all the incoming AC power 
is used. Full-wave rectification can be obtained by using 
1. A center-tapped transformer and two diodes. 
2. Four diodes arranged as a bridge circuit.  
0 V

      Volts/Div = ________  Time base = ________  
E l e c r t r o n i c s  
 47 
In a full-wave rectifier circuit two diodes are used together with a 
transformer whose secondary winding is split equally into two and has a 
common centre tapped connection (C) (Fig. 3.14). Now each diode conducts 
in turn when its anode terminal is positive with respect to the centre point C. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The circuit consists of two half-wave rectifiers connected to a single load 
resistance with each diode taking it in turn to supply current to the load. 
When point A is positive with respect to point B, diode D1 conducts in the 
forward direction as indicated by the arrows. When point B is positive (in the 
negative half of the cycle) with respect to point A, diode D2 conducts in the 
forward direction and the current flowing through resistor RL is in the same 
direction for both circuits and the output voltage across the resistor RL is the 
sum of the two waveforms (Fig. 3.15). 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
As the spaces between each half-wave developed by each diode is now 
being filled in by the other diode the average DC output voltage across the 
load resistor is now double that of the single half-wave rectifier circuit and is 
about 63.6% of the peak value Vm.  
That is,

For large sinusoidal inputs (Vm » VT) the forward-biased transition voltage 
of a diode can be ignored. However, for situations when the peak value of 
the sinusoidal signal is not that much greater than VT, VT can have a 
noticeable effect on VDC. 
To obtain a different DC voltage output different transformer ratios can be 
used, but one main disadvantage of this type of rectifier is that having a larger 
transformer for a given power output with two separate windings makes this 
type of circuit costly compared to a “Bridge Rectifier” circuit equivalent. 
Another type of circuit that produces the same output as a full-wave 
rectifier is that of the bridge rectifier. This type of single phase rectifier uses 4 
individual rectifying diodes connected in a “bridged” configuration (Fig. 3.16) 
to produce the desired output but does not require a special centre tapped 
transformer, thereby reducing its size and cost.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The 4 diodes labeled D1 to D4 are arranged in ”series pairs” with only two 
diodes conducting current during each half cycle. During the positive half 
cycle of the supply, diodes D1 and D2 conduct in series while diodes D3 and D4 
are reverse biased and the current flows through the load as shown in Fig. 3.17. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
During the negative half cycle of the supply, diodes D3 and D4 conduct 
in series (Fig. 3.18), but diodes D1 and D2 are switched off as they are now

reverse-biased. Note that regardless of the polarity of the input, the current 
flows in the same direction through the load. That is, the negative half-cycle 
of source is a positive half-cycle at the load. The current flow is through two 
diodes in series for both polarities. Thus, two diode drops of the source 
voltage are lost (0.7 V×2 = 1.4 V for Si) in the diodes. This is a disadvantage 
compared with a full-wave center-tap design. This disadvantage is only a 
problem in very low voltage power supplies.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Remembering the proper layout of diodes in a full-wave bridge rectifier 
circuit can often be frustrating. An alternative representation of this circuit is 
easier both to remember and to comprehend. It’s the exact same circuit, 
except all diodes are drawn in a horizontal attitude, all “pointing” the same 
direction (Fig. 3.19).  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
We saw in the previous experiments that the single phase half-wave 
rectifier produces an output wave every half cycle and that it was not 
practical to use this type of circuit to produce a steady DC supply. The full-
wave bridge rectifier however, gives us a greater mean DC value (0.636Vm) 
with less superimposed ripple while the output waveform is twice that of the 
frequency of the input supply frequency. We can therefore increase its 
average DC output level even higher by connecting a suitable smoothing 
capacitor across the output of the bridge circuit as shown in Fig. 3.20.

The smoothing capacitor converts the full-wave rippled output of the 
rectifier into a smooth DC output voltage. Two important parameters to 
consider when choosing a suitable a capacitor are its Working Voltage, which 
must be higher than the no-load output value of the rectifier and its 
Capacitance Value, which determines the amount of ripple that will appear 
superimposed on top of the DC voltage. Too low a value and the capacitor 
has little effect. As a general rule of thumb, to have a ripple voltage of less 
than 100 mV peak to peak is important for power suppliers. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The main advantages of a full-wave bridge rectifier is that it has a smaller 
AC ripple value for a given load and a smaller reservoir or smoothing 
capacitor than an equivalent half-wave rectifier. Therefore, the fundamental 
frequency of the ripple voltage is twice that of the AC supply frequency (100 
Hz) where for the half-wave rectifier it is exactly equal to the supply 
frequency (50 Hz). The amount of ripple voltage that is superimposed on top 
of the DC supply voltage by the diodes can be virtually eliminated by adding 
a much improved π-filter (pi-filter) to the output terminals of the bridge 
rectifier. This type of low-pass filter consists of two smoothing capacitors, 
usually of the same value and a choke or inductance across them to introduce 
a high impedance path to the alternating ripple component. Another more 
practical and cheaper alternative is to use a 3-terminal voltage regulator IC,

such as a LM7805 which can reduce the ripple by more than 70 dB while 
delivering over 1 amp of output current. 
In rectification systems the peak inverse voltage (PIV) or Zener breakdown 
voltage parameter must be considered carefully. For typical single diode half-
wave rectification systems, the required PIV level is equal to the peak value of 
the applied sinusoidal signal. For the four-diode full-wave bridge rectification 
system, the required PIV level is again the peak value, but for a two-diode 
center-tapped configuration, it is twice the peak value of the applied signal. 
The PIV voltage is the maximum reverse-bias voltage that a diode can handle 
before entering the Zener breakdown region.

TESTING ZENER DIODES 
OBJECTIVE 
• To demonstrate a practical method of testing Zener diodes with a power 
supply. 
 
An ohmmeter can detect a short or an open Zener diode in the same way 
as with a regular diode. However, this test does not determine if the diode 
will operate properly at its specified Zener voltage. A simple test can be 
performed on the Zener diode using a power supply that has a higher voltage 
than the VZ of the diode. The power supply can be variable or fixed using a 
potentiometer to vary its voltage. The Zener diode is reverse-biased by the 
power supply. The power supply voltage is gradually increased. The voltage 
across the diode will follow the increasing voltage until it reaches the VZ 
point, at which time an increase in power supply voltage will have little effect 
on the VZ point of the diode. 
MATERIALS NEEDED 
• (1) Variable power supply 
• (1)  Digital multimeter (DMM) 
• (1) 100-Ω resistor at 0.5 W (RS)  
• (1) 1N5231 Zener diode (5.1 V) or 1N960 Zener diode (9.1 V) or 
equivalent (Z1)

ZENER DIODE CHARACTERISTICS  
OBJECTIVE 
• To become familiar with the characteristics of a Zener diode. 
Because of the nature and the amount of doping in the silicon material 
used in the Zener, it has one greatly different characteristic. When reverse-
biased to a particular voltage determined by its construction, the Zener 
suddenly begins to conduct. Fig. 4.2 shows the conduction characteristics of a 
Zener diode. Note that the diode acts as any diode when forward-biased. And 
it behaves as any other diode when reverse-biased – until the voltage across it 
reaches breakdown voltage. The reverse or leakage current remains almost 
constant despite a great increase in reverse-biased voltage – until the Zener 
voltage is reached.  When the Zener breakdown voltage is reached, diode 
current begins to increase rapidly. The cause is the avalanche effect which 
causes electrons to be knocked loose from their bonds in the crystal structure. 
As more electrons are loosened, they in turn knock others loose and current 
builds quickly. This action causes the voltage drop across the Zener to remain 
essentially the same regardless of the Zener current. It is characteristic which 
makes the Zener so useful. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Once the Zener voltage is achieved, very small voltage changes create 
much greater current changes. Unlike the standard diode, this reverse current 
is not destructive. If the current is kept within the specified limits of the

particular diode by circuit resistance, no harm is done to the diode. Because 
the diode is designed to operate as a breakdown device, switching in and out 
of the Zener state is normal. All practical diodes have some internal resistance 
even though, typically, it is limited to 5 to 20 Ω. The internal resistance is the 
source of the variation in Zener voltage with current level. 
For most configurations, the state of the Zener diode can usually be 
determined simply by replacing the Zener diode with an open circuit and 
calculating the voltage across the resulting open circuit. If the open-circuit 
voltage equals or exceeds the Zener potential, the Zener diode is “on” and the 
Zener diode can be replaced by a DC supply equal to the Zener potential. 
Even though the open-circuit voltage may be greater than the Zener potential, 
the diode is still replaced by a supply equal to the Zener potential. 
Zener Specifications 
As with all components, manufacturers provide Zener diode specifications 
to guide the user. These are typical Zener diode specifications: 
 Zener Voltage (VZ) – reverse-biased voltage at which the diode begins 
to conduct; 
 Zener Voltage Tolerance – like the tolerance of a resistor, this figure 
gives the percentage above or below VZ that is acceptable for the 
particular diode, for example, 6.3 V ± 5 percent. 
 Maximum Zener Current (IZmax) – maximum current allowed to flow 
while the diode is in its reverse-biased conduction (Zener) mode. 
 Maximum Power Dissipation (PZ) – maximum power for the Zener to 
dissipate. 
 Impedance (ZZ) – impedance of the Zener while conducting in the 
Zener mode. 
 Maximum Operating Temperature – the highest temperature at which 
the device will operate reliably. 
Other specifications are available and listed in Zener data sheets, but they 
are primarily for engineering use. Presently, Zeners are available with 
breakdown voltages from 1 V to hundreds of volts.

HOW THE ZENER DIODE OPERATES AS A            
VOLTAGE REGULATOR 
 
OBJECTIVE 
 
• To show how the Zener diode regulates the voltage across its terminals 
by varying the current through it when there are varying load currents in 
the circuit. 
 
The function of a voltage regulator is to provide a constant low ripple 
output voltage under varying load current conditions. While very high quality 
voltage regulators are available in integrated circuits, at times it may be 
sufficient and convenient to use a Zener diode as voltage regulator in simple 
power supplies (Fig. 4.5) and as voltage references in more complex power 
supplies and other applications. Since the Zener diode will conduct in the 
reverse direction for any output voltage VL greater than VZ, VL can never 
exceed VZ at normal conditions. 
As the load current IL changes, the Zener diode will conduct sufficient 
current to maintain a voltage drop of (VS – VL) across the series dropping 
resistor, RS. The selected Zener diode must have a reverse breakdown voltage 
equal to the desired output voltage VL and be capable of dissipating the power 
that results when RL is very large. The difference between VS and VL should be 
selected as small as possible but must be large enough to prevent the voltage 
drop across RS from exceeding (VS – VL), when IL is maximum. It is clear that a 
smaller value for RS means a smaller value for (VS – VL); however, a smaller 
value for RS will result in a greater diode current when RL is large and this will 
increase the power dissipation requirement of the diode. 
E l e c r t r o n i c s  
 61 
Since the load is in parallel with the Zener diode, the voltage across RL is 
always the same as across Zener diode and is VZ = constant Zener voltage. 
The supply voltage VS must be greater than VZ. Zener diode must be operated 
under load. If not, the Zener is still delivering power (more than usual) and 
may be destroyed.

ZENER DIODES IN SERIES 
OBJECTIVE 
• To show how two Zener diodes in series can increase a regulated voltage. 
 
Refer to Fig. 4.6 and note that when two Zener diodes are connected in 
series (aiding) and are reverse biased, the regulated output voltage (Vout) is 
equal to the sum of each diode’s Zener voltage (Vout = VZ1 + VZ2). The total 
current (IT) flows through each diode; therefore, IT = IZ1 = IZ2. The circuit will 
respond the same way as a single Zener diode regulator. This type of circuit 
can be used for regulation of more specific voltages; for example, a desired 
regulated voltage of +14 V could use a 5-V Zener and a 9-V Zener or a +21-
V output might use a 9-V Zener and a 12-V Zener.

USING ZENER DIODES AS VOLTAGE LIMITERS 
OBJECTIVE  
• To demonstrate how a Zener diode can limit an ac voltage. 
 
Refer to Fig. 4.7 and note that a Zener diode can be used to limit peak 
voltages, thereby protecting other circuits that cannot withstand high voltages. 
In the forward-biased condition (when the positive alternation is present) the 
Zener diode conducts and a +0.7-V drop is seen across the load resistor. In 
the reverse-biased condition (when the negative alternation is present) the 
Zener diode does not conduct until the voltage exceeds its Zener voltage 
breakdown point (VZ). The diode then conducts and output voltage will now 
be clipped or clamped at the VZ level.

ZENER DIODE CLIPPING OF BOTH ALTERNATIONS 
OF A SINE WAVE 
OBJECTIVE 
• To show how two Zener diodes can limit or clamp the peaks of an ac sine 
wave. 
Referring to Fig. 4.8, when two Zener diodes are connected face to face 
or back to back in an ac circuit, both the positive and negative peaks will be 
clipped. When the positive alternation is present, Z1 is forward biased but no 
current flows initially, because Z2 is reverse biased. When the input voltage 
rises to the level of VZ of Z2, current flows and the output voltage is clipped at 
a level equal to the VZ of Z2 plus the forward voltage drop (VF) of Z1. In this 
case, Vout = VZ2 + VF1 = 5.1 V + 0.7 V = +5.8 V. When the negative 
alternation is present, Z2 is forward biased and Zl is reverse biased. No current 
will flow until the input voltage reaches the VZ of Z1. At this time, the output 
voltage will be clipped at the level of VZ1 + VF2, or –5.8 V.

BASIC INFORMATION 
Converting electrical energy into light energy is known as light emitting, 
light source, or photo source. A light-emitting diode (LED) is a photo-source 
device. Like a normal diode, it consists of a chip of semiconducting material 
doped with impurities to create a structure called a p-n junction. As in other 
diodes, current flows easily from the p-side, or anode to the n-side, or cathode, 
but not in the reverse direction. Charge carriers – electrons and holes flow 
into the junction from electrodes with different voltages. When an electron 
meets a hole, it falls into a lower energy level, and releases energy in the form 
of a photon as it does so. 
The wavelength of the light emitted, and therefore its color, depends on 
the bandgap energy of the materials forming the p-n junction. In silicon or 
germanium diodes, the electrons and holes recombine by a non-radiative 
transition which produces no optical emission, because these are indirect 
bandgap materials. The materials used for an LED have a direct bandgap with 
energies corresponding to near-infrared, visible or near-ultraviolet light. 
Conventional LEDs are made from a variety of inorganic minerals, 
producing different colors. Some of them are: 
• aluminium gallium arsenide (AlGaAs) - red and infrared  
• gallium aluminium phosphide (GaAlP) - green  
• gallium arsenide phosphide (GaAsP) - red, orange-red, orange, and 
yellow  
• gallium nitride (GaN) - green, pure green (or emerald green), and blue  
• gallium phosphide (GaP) - red, yellow and green

• indium gallium nitride (InGaN) - bluish-green and blue  
• indium gallium aluminium phosphide (InGaAlP) - orange-red, orange, 
yellow, and green  
 
The newest method used to produce white light LEDs uses no phosphors 
at all and is based on homoepitaxially grown zinc selenide (ZnSe) on a ZnSe 
substrate which simultaneously emits blue light from its active region and 
yellow light from the substrate. Recent color developments include pink and 
purple. Ultraviolet, blue, pure green, white, pink and purple LEDs are relatively 
expensive compared to the more common reds, oranges, greens, yellows and 
infrareds and are thus less commonly used in commercial applications. 
The semiconducting chip is encased in a solid plastic lens, which is much 
tougher than the glass envelope of a traditional light bulb or tube. The plastic 
may be colored, but this is only for cosmetic reasons or to improve the contrast 
ratio; the color of the packaging does not substantially affect the color of the 
light emitted. 
LEDs must be connected the correct way round, the diagram may be 
labeled a or + for anode and k or – for cathode (yes, it really is k, not c, for 
cathode!). The cathode is the short lead and there may be a slight flat on the 
body of round LEDs (Fig. 5.1). If you can see inside the LED the cathode is the 
larger electrode (but this is not an official identification method).  
 
 
 
 
 
LEDs are produced in a staggering array of shapes and sizes (Fig. 5.2). 
Though the color of the plastic lens cannot be guaranteed to correlate with the 
actual color of light emitted by the LED (for instance, purple plastic is often used 
for infrared LEDs), when not completely clear, it is often a good indicator. 
Unlike incandescent light bulbs, which light up regardless of the electrical 
polarity, LEDs will only light with positive electrical polarity. When the 
voltage across the p-n junction is in the correct direction, a significant current 
flows and the device is said to be forward-biased. If the voltage is of the wrong 
polarity, the device is said to be reverse biased, very little current flows, and 
no light is emitted. LEDs can be operated on an AC voltage, but they will only 
light with positive voltage, causing the LED to turn on and off at the frequency 
of the AC supply.

Actually, little or no current flows or light is produced until the forward-
biased voltage is equal to or greater than the inherent forward voltage drop 
(VF) of the LED, which is typically about 2 V. In the reverse-biased condition, 
little or no current flows and no light is produced. 
Never connect an LED directly to a battery or power supply! It will be 
destroyed almost instantly because too much current will pass through and 
burn it out. The LED must be protected with a series current-limiting resistor 
(R) as shown in Fig. 5.3. The value of this resistor is easily calculated using 
Ohm’s law. The VF of the LED is fairly constant; therefore, the voltage across R 
is the difference between the applied voltage (VS) and VF: VR = VS – VF. A safe 
forward current (IF) is chosen for the LED that produces sufficient light. This 
current, which also flows through R, is divided into VR to find the value of R: 
R = VR/IF. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
By using LED specifications sheet values an LED circuit can be designed 
for any source voltage. In Fig. 7.3, the LED is to be used in a circuit with a 
source of 5 V. By using the specifications From Fig. 5.3, we see that the 
resistor must drop 3.3 V if the LED is to drop 1.7 V. If the current is to be 20 
mA, as indicated is typical in the specification sheet, the value of R must be

Since the maximum current is listed as 50 mA, it is possible to use a 
standard 150-Ω resistor. Note that the maximum reverse voltage is only 8 V. 
LEDs do not have the same characteristics as general-purpose diodes, although 
the rating descriptions are the same, i.e., forward voltage, forward direct 
current, reverse voltage, etc. In this instance, if 8 V or more is placed across 
the LED in the reverse-biased polarity, the LED will likely be destroyed. 
If you wish to have several LEDs on at the same time it may be possible 
to connect them in series. This prolongs battery life by lighting several LEDs 
with the same current as just one LED.  
All the LEDs connected in series pass the same current so it is best if they 
are all the same type. The power supply must have sufficient voltage to provide 
about 2 V for each LED (4 V for blue and white) plus at least another 2 V for 
the resistor. To work out a value for the resistor you must add up all the LED 
voltages and use this for VL.  
Avoid connecting LEDs in parallel! Parallel operation (Fig. 5.4) is generally 
problematic. The LEDs have to be of the same type in order to have a similar 
forward voltage. If the LEDs require slightly different voltages only the lowest 
voltage LED will light and it may be destroyed by the larger current flowing 
through it. Although identical LEDs can be successfully connected in parallel 
with one resistor this rarely offers any useful benefit because resistors are very 
cheap and the current used is the same as connecting the LEDs individually.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
If LEDs are in parallel each one should have its own resistor.

• To show a practical method of testing LEDs with a digital multimeter 
(DMM). 
An LED is tested in the same way as a regular diode. The diode-testing 
scale of DMM can be used to determine the condition of a diode. With one 
polarity, the DMM should provide the “firing potential” (1600 or 50 when the 
diode conducts) of a LED, while the reverse connection should result in an 
“OL” or “1” response to support the open circuit approximation. The LED may 
even glow slightly with forward bias if the ohmmeter can produce sufficient 
current.

CONNECTION OF LEDS IN SERIES 
OBJECTIVE 
 
• To demonstrate how several LEDs turn on at the same time and to show 
the procedure for calculating series resistor R. 
All the LEDs connected in series pass the same current so it is best if they 
are all the same type. The power supply must have sufficient voltage to 
provide about 2 V for each LED (4 V for blue and white) plus at least another 
2 V for the resistor. To work out a value for the resistor you must add up all 
the LED voltages and use this for VL.  
A red, a yellow and a green LED in series need a supply voltage of at 
least 3 × 2 V + 2 V = 8 V, so a 9 V battery would be ideal. VL = 2 V + 2 V 
+ 2 V = 6 V (the three LED voltages added up). If the supply voltage VS is 9 V 
and the current IF must be 15 mA = 0.015 A, resistor R = (VS – VL)/1F = (9 – 
6)/0.015 = 3/0.015 = 200 Ω, so choose R = 220 Ω (the nearest standard

BASIC INFORMATION 
Junction transistors are an extension of diode technology. There are two 
junctions rather than one, and they come in two arrangements, NPN and 
PNP. In both types of transistors the elements are the same – emitter, base, 
and collector. Also, in either type the elements are arranged in the same 
manner with the base in the center and the emitter and collector being of the 
same type material. Electrons are the majority carriers in the NPN device. In 
the PNP holes are the majority carriers.  
Bipolar transistor is used in two modes of operation. It is used as a 
switch, turning current flow on or off, and it is used as an amplifier. Computer 
circuits are switching circuits, called binary or digital circuits. They are always 
either on or off. The amplifier is usually a linear circuit, meaning that it may 
be at any point on its range of conduction between its on and off points. Such 
circuits are used to amplify, or make bigger, any signal applied to it.  
For amplification with a minimum of distortion the linear region of the 
transistor characteristics is employed. A DC voltage is applied to the transistor, 
forward-biasing the base-emitter junction and reverse biasing the base-collector 
junction, typically establishing a quiescent point (Q-point) near or at the center 
of the linear region. 
With an NPN transistor, the base is made more positive than the emitter 
and the collector is made more positive than the base. The same biasing 
conditions are required for a PNP transistor to cause current to flow, except 
that the voltage polarities are reversed.

E l e c r t r o n i c s

The common (or grounded) emitter is the most frequently used transistor 
amplifier circuit. In this circuit the signal is applied between the base and 
ground. Remember, only a small amount of base current can control a much 
larger amount of collector current. When the output current is greater than 
the input current, we have current gain. In the common emitter (CE) circuit 
this gain is called beta (β). The equation which expresses this is 
constant  VII

The above equation states that β is the ratio of the change in collector 
current ∆IC effected by a change in base current ∆IB with collector voltage VCE 
maintained at a constant value. β, then, is the current amplification factor in a 
grounded-emitter amplifier. Another designation for β is hfe. 
Transistor amplifiers may be used to amplify DC or AC currents and/or 
voltages. To provide distortionless amplification, the base must be biased 
properly so that the input signal operates over the linear portion of the 
transistor’s characteristic. Otherwise, the output is driven into cutoff or 
saturation as illustrated in Fig. 6.1. The manner in which a transistor is biased 
therefore determines the output signal it will produce for a given level input 
signal.

EXPERIMENT 6.1  
TESTING BIPOLAR TRANSISTORS 
OBJECTIVE 
• To demonstrate a practical GO/NO GO method of testing bipolar 
transistors with an ohmmeter. 
Transistors are very sensitive to incorrect polarities. It is essential that the 
correct type of transistor be used and that the voltages applied have the correct 
polarities. Of course, the emitter, base and collector must be connected to the 
proper points in the circuit. A junction transistor has two junctions and can be 
considered as consisting of two diodes. The emitter-base junction is one diode 
junction. The base-collector junction is the other. Both can be checked with 
an ohmmeter. 
For ohmmeter testing purposes, an NPN transistor is similar to two 
diodes back to back as shown in Fig. 6.2b. The junction conducts only when 
the positive source is connected to the P material and the negative source is 
connected to the N material. When each PN junction is forward biased by the 
ohmmeter (positive lead to P material and negative lead to N material) (Fig. 
6.2c), there should be a low resistance indication. There should be a high 
resistance reading when these junctions are reverse biased, positive lead to N 
material and negative lead to P material (Fig. 6.2d). 
The PNP transistor can be tested with a similar method, except that the 
diodes are face to face as shown in Fig. 6.2e. This simple test determines if the 
transistor is shorted or open on a go (no problems)/no go (it has problems) basis. 
Most DMMs have a diode test. This function can be used for testing 
transistors. Both the emitter-base and the collector-base should test as diode 
junctions. The emitter-collector should not.

EXPERIMENT 6.2 
BIPOLAR TRANSISTOR AS A SWITCH 
OBJECTIVE 
 
• To show how to recognize, by circuit voltage drops, whether a bipolar 
transistor is conducting and nonconducting when used as a switch. 
A switch is a device that is used to “open” or “close” a circuit. Opening a 
circuit means creating a break in the circuit, preventing current flow and thus, 
turning it “off”.  Closing a circuit, on the other, means completing the circuit 
path, thereby allowing current to flow around it and thus, turning it “on”. The 
term “solid-state switch” refers to a switch that has no moving parts. 
The bipolar transistor, whether NPN or PNP, may be used as a switch.  
Recall that the bipolar transistor has three regions of operation: the cut-off 
region, the linear or active region, and the saturation region.  When used as a 
switch, the bipolar transistor is operated in the cut-off region (the region 
wherein the transistor is not conducting, and therefore makes the circuit 
“open”) and saturation region (the region wherein the transistor is in full 
conduction, thereby closing the circuit). 
Refer to Fig. 6.3 and note that when switch S1 is in position A, the 
emitter-base junction is reverse biased (VB = 0 V), the transistor is not 
conducting (off), and the total circuit voltage (+VCC) will appear at the 
collector (VC, or across collector and emitter). When S1 is in position B, the 
emitter-base junction is forward biased (VB ≈ 0.7 V), the transistor is 
conducting (on), and the collector voltage will be near ground potential (VC ≈ 
0.2 V). The transistor is saturated in this condition.

EXPERIMENT 6.3 
BIASING of a BJT 
OBJECTIVE 
• To determine the quiescent operating conditions of the fixed- and 
voltage-divider-bias BJT configurations. 
• To demonstrate how a bipolar transistor is used in a common-emitter 
amplifier circuit configuration, and to understand some of its character-
ristics. 
There are many forms of DC biasing to give Q-point in mid-range. The 
fixed-bias network is relatively simple and it has the serious drawback that the 
location of the Q-point is very sensitive to the forward current transfer ratio (β) 
of the transistor and temperature. Because there can be wide variations in β 
and the temperature of the device or surrounding medium can change for a 
wide variety of reasons, it can be difficult to predict the exact location of the 
Q-point on the load line of a fixed-bias configuration.  
The most frequently used of all fixed-bias circuits is voltage-divider bias. 
The voltage-divider bias network employs a feedback arrangement that makes 
the base-emitter and collector-emitter voltages primarily dependent on the 
external circuit elements and not the beta of the transistor. Thus even though 
the beta of individual transistors may vary considerably, the location of the Q-
E l e c r t r o n i c s  
 85 
point on the load line will remain essentially fixed. The phrase “beta-
independent biasing” is often used for such an arrangement. 
Voltage-divider biasing arrangement is commonly used in the design of 
bipolar transistor amplifier circuits and which greatly reduces the effects of 
varying beta, (β) by holding the base bias at a constant steady voltage allowing 
for best stability. The quiescent base voltage (VB) is determined by the 
potential divider network formed by the two resistors and the power supply 
voltage VCC. The voltage level generated at the junction of resistors holds the 
base voltage (VB) constant at a value below the supply voltage. Because the 
base is made positive by this voltage divider, there is emitter-base and emitter-
collector current flow. The bias voltage, which determines the base-bias 
current, is the potential difference between the base and emitter.  
It is possible to determine experimentally the voltage gain of the amplifier 
by injecting a measured signal voltage into the input between base and ground. 
The output-signal voltage between collector and ground is then measured, and 
the ratio of output signal to input signal is the required voltage-gain figure. 
That is,

The amplifier must be operated over its linear region during this process.

4. The next part of the experiment will essentially be a repeat of a number 
of the steps above for a transistor with a higher beta. Our goal is to show 
the effects of different beta levels on the resulting levels of the important 
quantities of the network. First the beta level for the other transistor, 
specifically a 2N4401 transistor, must be determined. Simply remove 
the 2N3904 transistor from Fig. 6.6 and insert 2N4401 transistor, leaving 
all the resistors and voltage VCC as in Exp. 6.3.1. Then measure the 
voltages VBE and 
CR

resistor values, calculate the levels of IB and IC. Then determine the level 
of β for the 2N4401 transistor.

of the percent change in each quantity due to change in transistors, 
specifically to one with a higher level of beta. Ideally, the important 
voltage and current levels should not change with a change in transistors 
but the fixed-bias configuration has a high sensitivity to changes in beta 
as will be reflected by the results. Place the results of your calculations

BASIC INFORMATION  
Junction Field Effect Transistors (JFETs) are subdivided into two major 
classes: junction field-effect transistors (JFETs) and metal-oxide-semiconductor 
field-effect transistors (MOSFETs). Since MOSFETs burn out very easily (static 
electricity easily destroys MOSFETs, but once soldered into a circuit, however, 
MOSFETs are quite robust), we will concentrate on JFETs.  
JFETs, particularly discrete JFETs, are less common than bipolar or MOSFET 
transistors, but will give us a good picture of how transistor circuits work. 
The JFET exhibits characteristics which often make it more suited to a 
particular application than the bipolar transistor. Some of these applications are: 
• Displacement sensors 
• High input impedance amplifiers 
• Low-noise amplifiers 
• Differential amplifiers 
• Constant current sources 
• Analogue switches or gates 
• Voltage controlled resistors 
Under normal operating conditions, the JFET gate must be negatively 
biased relative to the source. The JFET may burn out if the gate is positively 
biased. The JFET gate and source-drain form a p-n junction diode; a very 
simple model of the JFET is shown in Fig. 7.1, in which the resistance depends 
on the gate bias. Since the gate is negatively biased relative to the source, the 
diode is reverse biased. Consequently the gate current will be negligible,

thereby proving that ID = IS. Note that checking a JFET’s internal diode with a 
DMM is a good way of determining if the JFET is working; the diode is usually 
blown out in broken JFETs.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
A more useful JFET model replaces the variable resistor with a variable 
current source (Fig. 7.2) whose current depends on the gate voltage VGS and 
the drain-source voltage, VDS. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The drain-source current is largest when the gate-source voltage VGS is 
zero, typically about 50 mA. As VGS is made negative, the current decreases. 
When the gate-source voltage VGS reaches a critical value called the gate-
source pinch off voltage VS, the drain current ID is cutoff entirely; no current 
flows. The value of VS depends on the particular type of JFET (and even varies 
substantially between JFETs of the same type), but is typically around –4 V. As 
VGS is raised towards 0 V, current ID starts to flow. Simple models of JFET 
performance predict that current vs. gate voltage will be parabolic, but actual 
devices may differ substantially from this prediction.  
Transistors are manufactured in many different packages and sizes. The 
leads are arranged in a triangle (Fig. 7.3); the gate lead is the first lead clockwise

from the tab when looking down (onto the can end, not the lead end) on the 
JFET.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
When inserting the JFET into the breadboard, there is no need to squash 
the leads out horizontally. In fact, doing so risks accidentally shorting the 
leads to the case.  
Instead, just bend them out gently so that they form a triangular pattern, 
which will insert into the transistor sockets on the breadboard.  
 
 
 
 
EXPERIMENT 7.1 
Testing JFETs  
OBJECTIVE 
• To demonstrate a practical GO/NO GO method of testing JFETs with an 
ohmmeter. 
For ohmmeter testing purposes, the N-channel JFET is similar to a diode 
with its cathode connected to the middle of a resistor, as shown in Fig. 7.4b. 
The ohmic resistance of the channel should be about the same regardless of 
the polarity of the ohmmeter lead connections from source to drain. With the 
positive lead on the gate, there should be a low-resistance reading when the 
negative lead is placed on the source or drain. The reading should be infinite 
when the negative lead is on the gate and the positive lead is placed on the 
source or drain. The same procedures are used for a P-channel JFET, except 
that the diode’s anode is connected to the resistor and the ohmmeter polarities 
are reversed.

EXPERIMENT 7.3 
JFET Biasing 
OBJECTIVE 
• To analyze the fixed-, self-, and voltage-divider-bias JFET networks. 
BASIC INFORMATION 
For the field-effect transistor, the relationship between input and output 
quantities is nonlinear due to the squared term in Shockley’s equation. Linear 
relationships result in straight lines when plotted on a graph of one variable 
versus the other, while nonlinear functions result in curves as obtained for the 
transfer characteristics of a JFET. The nonlinear relationship between ID and 
VGS can complicate the mathematical approach to the dc analysis of FET 
configurations. A graphical approach may limit solutions to tenths-place 
accuracy, but it is a quicker method for most FET amplifiers. Since the 
graphical approach is in general the most popular, the analysis of this chapter 
will have a graphical orientation rather than direct mathematical techniques. 
Another distinct difference between the analysis of BJT and FET 
transistors is that the input controlling variable for a BJT transistor is a current 
level, while for the FET a voltage is the controlling variable. In both cases, 
however, the controlled variable on the output side is a current level that also 
defines the important voltage levels of the output circuit. 
To begin, the transconductance curve, which shows the relationship 
between VGS and ID for a particular JFET, is constructed from the saturation 
current IDSS, the pinch-off voltage VP, and Shockley’s equation:

−=  
In this experiment, three different biasing circuits will be analyzed. In 
theory, the procedure for biasing a JFET is the same as that for a BJT. In 
particular, given the drain curve characteristics of the JFET and the external 
circuit connected to the JFET, a load line is constructed involving VDD, VDS and 
ID. The intersection of that load line with the drain curve characteristics 
determines the quiescent operating point for the JFET. It is noted that the 
characteristics of the device are a property of the JFET; by contrast: the load 
line is dependent on the external circuit elements connected to the JFET. The 
quiescent operating point is determined by the intersection of the two curves. 
K h a l i l   I s m a i l o v 
 102 
In practice, JFETs, even of the same type, show considerable variation in 
their drain curve characteristics. As a result, manufacturers often do not 
publish these curves; rather, the values for the saturation current and the 
pinch-off voltage are given as part of the specifications. This leads to an 
alternative approach to determine the quiescent condition for a JFET. 
MATERIALS NEEDED 
• (1)  Adjustable dual ±15V power supply 
• (1)  DMM as a digital voltmeter 
• (1)  2N3823 JFET (or equivalent) 
• (1)  1 kΩ potentiometer (or nearest available value)

EXPERIMENT 7.3.2 
Self-Bias Network 
The self-bias configuration eliminates the need for two DC supplies and 
the magnitude of VGS is defined by the the product of the drain current ID and 
source resistance RS. The network bias line will start at the origin and intersect 
the transfer curve at the quiescent (DC) point of operation. The resulting drain 
curret and gate-to-source voltage can then be determined from the graph by 
drawing a horizantal and a vertical line from the quiescent point to the axis, 
respctively.  
Note:  The larger the source resistance, the more horizantal the bias line and 
the less the resulting drain current.

OBJECTIVES 
1.  To measure ±Vsat. 
2.  To measure output offset voltage. 
3.  To predict both the magnitude and polarity of V0. 
BASIC INFORMATION 
A basic operational amplifier (op-amp) is a solid-state device with several 
circuits within a single package capable of sensing and amplifying DC and AC 
signals. Op-amps can be used for various electronic circuit functions with 
only a few external components. 
An operational amplifier is a very high-gain, direct-coupled, differential 
amplifier (it amplifies the difference of the input signals) that uses feedback for 
control of its response characteristic. (A direct-coupled amplifier is capable of 
amplifying DC as well as time varying signals, or a combination of the two.)  
The output of the amplifier v0 is given by the formula: 
  v0 = A(v+ – v–)                              (8.1) 
where A is the open-loop voltage gain of the amplifier, v+ is the non-inverting 
input voltage and v– is the inverting input voltage. Both v+ and v– are node 
voltages with respect to ground. Typically, the open-loop voltage gain A is on 
the order of 105 – 106. A resistor is placed between the output node and the 
inverting input to provide feedback and adjust amplification. When an op-
amp circuit behaves linearly, the op-amp adjusts its output current such that 
the voltage difference between the two inputs is nearly zero.

 110 
  v+ = v–                                     (8.2) 
Another important feature of the op-amp is that its input resistance is very 
large and may be taken as infinite in many applications. The most common 
type of op-amp is the 741 which has an input resistance of 2 MΩ. This is large 
enough to be considered infinite in most applications. Because of the high 
input resistance, only a very small current flows into either input of an op-
amp. In practical op-amp circuits, the current flowing into either of the inputs 
is usually on the order of µA. In the case of an ideal op-amp, where the single 
assumption is made that the open-loop voltage gain A goes to infinity, 
  ii = 0                                   (8.3) 
where ii is defined to be the current entering the non-inverting input and 
exiting the inverting input. Equations (8.2) and (8.3) can be used to analyze 
most of the properties of op-amp circuits. 
Ideally, the output voltage between the inverting and noninverting inputs 
is 0. In reality, the output voltage may still have a slight offset or unbalance. 
This output offset is caused by internal mismatches, tolerances, and so on. In 
other words, even if you short-circuit the inverting and noninverting inputs 
together to eliminate the effect of input bias current, the output may still have 
a slight offset from 0. 
The input offset voltage is the differential input voltage between the 
inverting and noninverting inputs needed to null or zero the quiescent output 
voltage. For example, a 741 has a worst-case input offset voltage of 5 mV.  
The op-amps are housed in small black plastic packages called DIPs (dual 
in-line packages). The circuits themselves are etched into pieces of silicon 
embedded within the black plastic. The pieces of silicon are sometimes 
referred to as “chips.” That term also can be used to refer to the whole 
package. 
A 741 op-amp in a typical DIP (Dual In-line Package) is shown in Fig. 
8.1. On any DIP, pin 1 is indicated either by a dot immediately adjacent to 
the pin or a notch in the end of the DIP package near pin 1. The pins are 
numbered in counterclockwise order around the device (looking from above).

The chip layout of the op-amp 741 is shown in Fig. 8.2.   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Pin 2 is the inverting input, pin 3 is the non-inverting input, and the 
amplifier output is pin 6. These three pins are the terminals that normally 
appear on the op-amp symbol in a circuit diagram. Even though the VCC and 
VEE connections must be made for the op-amp to work, they are often omitted 
from the circuit schematic for simplicity.  
The null offset pins (1 and 5) provide a way to eliminate any “offset” in 
the output voltage of the amplifier. The offset voltage (usually denoted by Vos) 
is an artifact of the integrated circuit. The offset voltage is additive with v0 (pin 
6 in this case), can be either positive or negative and is normally less than 10 
mV. Because the offset voltage is so small, in most cases we can ignore the 
contribution Vos makes to V0 and we leave the null offset pins open. 
Pin 8, labeled “NC”, has no connection to the internal circuitry of the 
741, and is not used. 
The standard symbol for an op-amp is shown in the left side of Fig. 8.3. 
Voltages are applied to the inverting and/or noninverting input terminals. V0

The “Simple Symbol” of the op-mp at left in Fig. 8.3 is a functional 
schematic. The industrial standard op-amp, the 741, requires two power 
supplies, one positive and one negative. For most applications the magnitude 
of these two voltages is the same. The wiring schematic on the right is implied 
by the use of the functional schematic (i.e. the power supply connections are 
assumed to be made).

As seen from the diagram of Fig. 8.3 you need both a plus and minus 
voltage supply. For that power supply unit must be operated in its dual mode 
setting selection switch PAR/INDEPENDENT/SERIES to INDEPENDENT/SERIES 
position. Short the output GND terminal, channel 1 (+) output terminal and 
channel 2 (–) output terminal together with a short bar (Fig. 8.5); then you can 
get negative output voltage of 0 ~ 30 V from channel 1 and positive output 
voltage of 0 ~ 30 V from channel 2.  
How to set up your power supplies: 
1. Before connecting the power supply to the op-amp, be sure both +/– 
supplies are set to 15 volts. 
2. The power supply +15 V (orange + terminal) should be connected to 
741 pin 7. 
3. The power supply –15 V (black – terminal) should be connected to 741 
pin 4. 
4. The power supply ±15V blue GND terminal must be connected to the 
circuit ground point (used by the input and output circuits). 
 The +15 V and –15 V always stay at the same pins throughout the 
experiment. Do not switch them or you will destroy the op amp! 
5. When you are ready to turn the power on, always turn the DC supplies 
on first, then apply the AC signal. 
6. To turn the circuit off always remove the AC signal first and then the turn 
off the DC supply.

EXPERIMENT 8.3  
Predicting the Magnitude and Polarity of V0 
1. Both the magnitude and polarity of V0 are controlled by the input 
terminals of the op-amp. The magnitude V0 = AOLEd and the polarity of 
V0 depend on the polarity of Ed, where Ed = v+ – v–. To demonstrate how 
the input terminals control V0, start by building Fig. 8.9. This circuit is 
simple resistor divider network to establish two input voltages V1 and V2 
of approximately +5 V and –5 V, respectively. 
2.  Measure both V1 and V2 with respect to ground, and record their values:  
 V1 = _________ , V2 = _________ .  
 Use these voltages as inputs to the next three op-amp circuits as well as 
the equations above to predict that V0 can never exceed the practical 
limits of ±Vsat.

OBJECTIVES 
• To measure DC and AC voltages in linear op-amp circuits. 
BASIC INFORMATION 
The extremely high open-loop gain of an op-amp creates an unstable 
situation because a small noise voltage on the input can be amplified to a 
point where the amplifier is driven out of its linear region. Negative feedback 
takes a portion of the output and applies it back out-of-phase with the input, 
creating an effective reduction in gain. This closed-loop gain is usually much 
less than the open-loop gain and independent of it.  
The advantages of negative feedback are: stabilizing the gain, improving 
input and output impedances, and increasing bandwidth. 
Suppose the voltage gain of an amplifier (A) increases because of 
temperature change or some other reason. The output voltage will rise. This 
means more negative voltage is fed back to the input. The feedback voltage 
subtracts from the input voltage, decreasing the output to almost completely 
offset the original increase in voltage gain A. The result is that v0 hardly 
increases at all. 
A similar analysis applies to a decrease in voltage gain A. If A decreases 
for any reason, the output voltage decreases. In turn, the feedback voltage 
decreases, almost completely offsetting the original decrease in voltage gain 
A. As a result, the output voltage shows only the slightest decrease. 
The op-amp circuit with negative feedback is block diagramed in Fig. 9.1; 
the total gain derived by noting that

The overall voltage gain does not depend on the internal gain A, which is 
temperature-and transistor-dependent. Instead, the overall gain depends only 
on the value of B. The feedback circuit is usually a voltage divider with 
precision resistors. This means B is an accurate and stable value. Because of 
this, the voltage gain of a negative-feedback circuit becomes a rock-solid value 
equal to 1/B. For instance, if B = 0.1, then the gain is 10. If B = 0.01, then 
the gain is 100. 
Op-amps can only be used as linear amplifiers with external negative 
feedback. The negative feedback is achieved by a voltage divider circuit 
which feeds back a fraction of the output signal to the inverting input. 
Depending on how (in which form) the negative feedback is achieved and 
how the signal is fed to the input, different types of amplifiers with different 
characteristics are created.

signal drives the noninverting input of the op-amp and the output is in phase

EXPERIMENT 9.3  
Unity-Gain Amplifier 
By letting R1→ ∞ and R2 = 0, Eq. (9.4) gives V0/Vi = 1. Fig. 9.10 shows 
the resulting circuit.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The voltage gain of this configuration is 1. The output voltage follows the 
input: 
V0 = Vi 
So what is the usefulness of this op-amp circuit?  
Let’s look at the input and output resistance characteristics of the circuit. 
As we have discussed, the resistance at the input terminals of the op-amp is 
very large. Indeed, for our ideal model we have taken the value of that 
resistance to be infinite. Therefore the signal Vi sees a very large resistance 
which eliminates any loading of the signal source. Similarly, since the output 
resistance of the op-amp is very small (zero ideally), the loading is also 
eliminated at the output of the device. In effect this is a resistance transformer.  
Volts/Div =                       Time/Div =

In order to see the importance of this buffer circuit let’s consider the case 
where the input signal is a source with an output resistance RS and is 
connected to a load with resistance RL. In Fig. 9.11(a) the signal source is 
connected directly to the load RL.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
From Fig. 9.11(a), the voltage divider formed by RS and RL gives a value 
for vL which is a fraction of vi given by  
 i

L
L v
RR
R
v
+
=      (9.7) 
For example, if RL=1 kΩ and RS=10 kΩ, then vL≈0.1vi which represents 
a considerable attenuation (loading) of the signal source.  
If we now connect the signal source to the load with a buffer amplifier as 
shown on Fig. 9.11(b). Since the input resistance of the amplifier is very large 
(no current flows into the terminal), the voltage at the non-inverting terminal, 
vp, is equal to vi. In addition, since the output resistance of the op-amp is zero, 
the voltage across the load resistor vL=v0=vi. The load now sees the input 
voltage signal but it places no demands on the signal source since it is 
“buffered” by the operational amplifier circuit.

EXPERIMENT 9.4  
Summing Amplifier 
One of the most common applications for an op-amp is to algebraically 
add two (or more) signals or voltages to form the sum of those signals. Such a 
circuit is known as a summing amplifier, or just as a summer. 
The summing amplifier is based upon the standard inverting operational 
amplifier configuration. As seen from Fig. 9.1, the inverting amplifier has a 
single input signal applied to the inverting input terminal. If a second input 
resistor is added to the inverting amplifier circuit then the current through this 
resistor must be added to the total input current to the summing node. The

resultant output is then a weighted sum of the input voltages. Additional input

• To construct, test and debug simple analog circuits with practical resistors, 
capacitors, transistors, operational amplifiers and 555 timers. 
10.1 Dual Voltage Power Supply 
Dual voltage power supply circuit (Fig. 10.1.1) requires a few components 
to build. The most important components of this circuit are REGULATORS: 
AN7812 and AN7912.

AN7812 is the Positive Voltage Regulator. It regulates the voltage from 
(almost) 24 V to 12 V (accurate). AN7912 is the Negative Voltage Regulator. It 
regulates the voltage from (almost) –24 V to –12 V. A transformer output must 
be between 12 V AC to 24 V AC @ 500 mA. Input of transformer (Primary) 
should be about 110 V AC - 220 V AC. It also includes some capacitors to 
filter the current.

10.2 Three Transistor Audio Amplifier (50 mW) 
Here is a little audio amplifier (Fig. 10.2.1) similar to what you might find 
in a small transistor radio. The input stage is biased so that the supply voltage 
is divided equally across the two complimentary output transistors which are 
slightly biased in conduction by the diodes between the bases. A 3.3 Ω 
resistor is used in series with the emitters of the output transistors to stabilize 
the bias current so it doesn't change much with temperature or with different 
transistors and diodes. As the bias current increases, the voltage between the 
emitter and base decreases, thus reducing the conduction.  
 
Fig. 10.2.1 Three transistor audio amplifier circuit 
Input impedance is about 500 Ω and voltage gain is about 5 with an 8 Ω 
speaker attached. The voltage swing on the speaker is about 2 V without 
distorting and power output is in the 50 mW range. A higher supply voltage 
and the addition of heat sinks to the output transistors would provide more 
power. Circuit draws about 30 mA from a 9 V supply.

10.3 Improved Three Transistor Audio Amplifier (80 mW) 
Three transistor audio amplifier circuit (Fig. 10.3.1) is similar to the one in 
Fig. 10.2.1 but uses positive feedback to get a little more amplitude to the 
speaker. In the circuit of Fig. 10.2.1 the load resistor for the driver transistor is 
tied directly to the + supply. This has a disadvantage in that as the output 
moves positive, the drop across the 470 Ω resistor decreases which reduces 
the base current to the top NPN transistor. Thus the output cannot move all 
the way to the + supply because there wouldn't be any voltage across the 470 
Ω resistor and no base current to the NPN transistor.  
This circuit corrects the problem somewhat and allows a larger voltage 
swing and probably more output power. The output still won't move more 
than a couple volts using small transistors since the peak current won't be 
more than 100 mA or so into a 25 Ω load. But it's an improvement over the 
other circuit shown in Fig. 10.2.1.  
In circuit of Fig. 10.3.1, the 1 kΩ load resistor is tied to the speaker so 
that as the output moves negative, the voltage on the 1 kΩ resistor is reduced, 
which aids in turning off the top NPN transistor. When the output moves 
positive, the charge on the 470 µF capacitor aids in turning on the top NPN 
transistor.  
The 2 diodes D1 and D2 aid the amplifier to operate on lower voltages 
with less distortion. The transistors shown 2N3053 and 2N2905 are just parts 
used for the other circuit of Fig. 10.2.1 and could be smaller types. Most any 
small transistors can be used, but they should be capable of 100 mA or more 
current. A 2N3904 or 2N3906 are probably a little small, but would work at 
low volume.  
The 2 diodes generate a fairly constant bias voltage as the battery drains 
and reduces crossover distortion. But you should take care to insure the idle 
current is around 10 to 20 milliamps with no signal and the output transistors 
do not get hot under load.  
The circuit should work with a regular 8 Ω speaker, but the output power 
may be somewhat less. To optimize the operation, select a resistor where the 
100 kΩ is shown to set the output voltage at 1/2 the supply voltage (4.5 V). 
This resistor might be anything from 50 kΩ to 700 kΩ depending on the gain 
of the transistor used where the 3904 is shown.

10.4 Sinewave Generator (1 kHz) 
Simple circuitry, low distortion, battery operated. Variable, low impedance 
output up to 1 V RMS. 
Sinewave generator circuit (Fig. 10.4.1) generates a good 1 kHz sinewave 
adopting the inverted Wien bridge configuration (C1-R3 and C2-R4). It 
features a variable output, low distortion and low output impedance in order 
to obtain good overload capability. A small filament bulb ensures a stable 
long term output amplitude waveform. Useful to test the Precision Audio 
Millivoltmeter, Three-Level Audio Power Indicator, and other audio circuits. 
Notes: 
The bulb must be a low current type (12 V 40-50 mA or 6 V 50 mA) in 
order to obtain good long term stability and low distortion. 
Distortion @ 1 V RMS output is 0.15% using a 12 V 40 mA bulb, rising to 
0.5% with a 12 V 100 mA one. 
Using a bulb differing from specifications may require a change of R6 
value to 220 Ω or 150 Ω to ensure proper circuit's oscillation. 
Set R5 to read 1 V RMS on an Audio Millivoltmeter connected to the 
output with R7 rotated fully clockwise, or to view a sine wave of 2.828 Vp-p 
amplitude on the oscilloscope.

With C1, C2 = 100 nF the frequency generated is 100 Hz and with C1, 
C2 = 1 nF frequency is 10 kHz but R5 requires adjustment. 
High gain transistors are preferred for better performance.

a single 1.5 V cell as power supply. 
A useful feature of this circuit is that frequency changes can be obtained 
by switching only one capacitor at a time. 
Current consumption is about 600 µA.

10.6 Function Generator Circuit 
Probably in some electronic circuits you need a function generator that 
can produce a square, sinus or triangle wave. In this case you will need a 
specialized function generator that will generate all needed wave forms, or 
you can use this simple function generator circuit that use common 
operational amplifiers to generate various wave forms. 
This simple function generator (Fig. 10.6.1) uses four operational 
amplifiers (op-amps) to deliver these waveforms (sinus, triangle and square) in 
the 6 Hz to 7000 Hz range. 
Square, sine and triangle waves are produced using an LM348 and 
passive components. The LM348 is a quad operational amplifier IC package; 
that contains four separate op-amps all in the one package. They are marked 
A, B, C and D in the schematic diagram. 
To provide square wave at output one operational amplifier (LM348:D) is 
used. The voltage level to pin 13 is set by the resistor divider pair R1 and R2. 
The input to pin 12 depends on two things; firstly the potential of pin 14, and 
secondly, the voltage output of op-amp C at pin 8. When the input at pin 13 is 
higher than the input at pin 12 the output goes low. If it is lower then the 
output goes high. Switching back and forth between the two states causes a 
square wave to be produced. The time constant (R4+R5)C2 determines the 
frequency. 
 
Fig. 10.6.1 Simple function generator  
K h a l i l   I s m a i l o v 
 140 
To provide triangle wave op-amp C is set up as an integrator. It performs 
the mathematical operation of integration with respect to time. For a constant 
input the output is a constant multiplied by the elapsed time, that is, the 
output is a ramp. Since the input signal goes to the inverting input, a high 
input will produce a ramp down and a low input will produce a ramp up. The 
input signal is a square wave symmetrical about the midpoint potential. The 
current this potential produces through R4 and R5 is constant so the up and 
down ramps are of equal gradient and the resultant triangular wave is 
symmetrical. Any increase in the trimpot R5 reduces the current and the 
integration constant which lowers the gradient of the ramp. 
The switching levels have not changed so the frequency reduces while 
the amplitude remains constant. In a similar way the current depends on the 
value of integration capacitor. Accordingly the integration constant and hence 
the frequency vary with the value of the capacitor. 
The output triangle wave does not require amplification but it does 
require buffering so that that loading does not affect the waveform generator 
circuit. It is buffered here with op-amp A connected as a unity gain buffer. 
Unity gain is achieved by directly coupling back the output to the inverting 
input. 
Sine wave is produced by a wave shaping circuit. Two diodes have been 
joined together as a series pair in order to provide higher amplitude than 
would be obtained using only a single diode. 
The shape of the pseudo sine wave could be improved at any particular 
frequency by filtering, but filtering will cause distortion at lower frequencies 
and loss of amplitude at higher frequencies. You can have perfect sine waves 
at particular frequencies by switching in appropriate filters at those 
frequencies. 
The sine wave is sensitive to loading and must be buffered. It is also low 
in amplitude and needs amplification. R9 and R10 set the gain of op-amp B by 
forming a voltage divider between the source and the output. 
If this type of operational amplifier is not available you can use a similar 
type.

10.7 Battery Tester Circuit 
The purpose of the Battery Low Indicator (Fig. 10.7.1) is to give a visual 
indication when a battery has been discharged below a specific level. This is 
especially crucial for rechargeable batteries that should not be discharged 
below a certain voltage level. This lower voltage limit depends upon the type 
of the battery.  
Is the battery empty, or is there something wrong with the device? That’s 
always a difficult question when your walkman or some other battery-powered 
device appears to be dead when you switch it on. Before you take it to the shop 
for servicing, the first thing you should do is to test the battery or batteries.  
Many commercial battery testers consist of nothing more than a resistor, a 
simple little meter and a push-button. Some manufacturers include an even 
simpler tester with a set of batteries, consisting of a strip of plastic with a layer 
of some sort of electrically conductive material that changes color when a 
current grows through it. If you press this strip over the battery between the 
positive and negative terminals, a fully charged battery will cause a more 
intense change in color than a partially discharged battery. 
 
Fig. 10.7.1 Battery tester circuit diagram 
K h a l i l   I s m a i l o v 
 142 
Naturally, tests of this sort do not provide especially reliable or accurate 
results. The idea behind the circuit described here is to load a single battery, a 
set of batteries connected in series, a rechargeable battery, or even a small 
button cell with a reasonably constant current and use a separate multimeter 
or voltmeter module (M1) to check the voltage. A quickly decreasing voltage 
indicates that the battery or batteries will have to be replaced soon. If a 
constant-current circuit is used for the load, the current can never to be large 
and there is no need to make an adjustment for the number of cells. 
The constant-current circuit is specially designed to work with a voltage 
as low as 0.9 V. It’s quite difficult to make a circuit work at even lower 
voltages with normal transistors. The active constant-current element is 
transistor T1. The current through it is held constant by comparing the voltage 
across resistor R1 in its collector path with a relatively constant reference 
voltage across diode D1. This comparison is provided by differential amplifier 
T3/T4. 
The voltage across diode D1 (a Schottky type) is reasonably constant by 
nature, but it is also stabilized by using FET T5 as a simple constant-current 
sink. T5 also limits the current at relatively high voltages (with several batteries 
in series). The constant voltage across D1 is transferred to resistor R2 by 
differential amplifier T1/T2, so a constant current grows through R1 from the 
battery or batteries being tested. R1 has a relatively low resistance, so this 
current is larger than the current drawn by the rest of the circuit. 
The quiescent current, which incidentally is also reasonably constant, is 
thus negligible. The test current thus remains reasonably constant while the 
battery or batteries is/are being tested. The maximum battery voltage that the 
tester can handle is set by T5, and here it is 30 V. To ensure that T1 does not 
get too warm at high battery voltages, keep the test as short as possible. Use a 
push-button switch as a test switch so the battery being tested cannot be left 
under load by accident.

10.8 Low Battery Indicator 
This simple low battery indicator circuit (Fig. 10.8.1) lights LED1 when 
the battery voltage drops below the setting set by trimpot VR1. In effect, VR1 
and associated resistors bias Q1 on which holds Q2 and the LED off. When 
the voltage drops below the set value, Q1 turns off, allowing Q2 to turn on 
and light the LED. The circuit is suitable for nominal battery voltages up to 12 
V.

10.9 LED 12 V Lead Acid Battery Meter 
In the circuit of Fig. 10.9.1, a quad voltage comparator (LM339) is used as 
a simple bar graph meter to indicate the charge condition of a 12 V, lead acid 
battery. A 5 V reference voltage is connected to each of the (+) inputs of the 
four comparators and the (–) inputs are connected to successive points along a 
voltage divider. The LEDs will illuminate when the voltage at the negative (–) 
input exceeds the reference voltage. Calibration can be done by adjusting the 
2 kΩ potentiometer so that all four LEDs illuminate when the battery voltage is 
12.7 V, indicating full charge with no load on the battery. At 11.7 V, the LEDs 
should be off indicating a dead battery. Each LED represents an approximate 
K h a l i l   I s m a i l o v 
 144 
25% change in charge condition or 300 mV, so that 3 LEDs indicate 75%, 2 
LEDs indicate 50%, etc. The actual voltages will depend on temperature 
conditions and battery type, wet cell, gel cell etc.

10.10 Cell Phone Battery Meter (3.6 V) 
Cell phone battery meter circuit (Fig. 10.10.1) is a similar to the circuit 
shown in Fig. 10.9.1 and provides a 4 LED bar graph indicating the voltage of 
common 3.6 V Lithium-Ion rechargeable cell phone battery. The reference 
voltage is provided by a TL431 programmable voltage source which is set to 
3.9 V where the TL431 connects to the 1 kΩ resistor. The lower reference for 
the LED at pin 14 is set with the 5 kΩ adjustable resistor. 
The TL431/TL431A are three-terminal adjustable regulator series with a 
guaranteed thermal stability over applicable temperature ranges. The output 
voltage may be set to any value between VREF (approximately 2.5 volts) and 36 
volts with two external resistors. 
The programmed voltage of the TL431 is worked out with a voltage divider 
(10 kΩ/5.6 kΩ). The adjustment terminal or junction of the two resistors is 
always 2.5 V. So, if we use a 10 kΩ resistor from the adjustment terminal to 
E l e c r t r o n i c s  
 145 
ground, the resistor current will be (2.5 V)/(10 kΩ) = 250 µA. This same 
current flows through the upper resistor (5.6 kΩ) and produces a voltage drop 
of 0.00025×5600 = 1.4 V. So the shunt regulated output voltage at the 
cathode of the TL431 will be (2.5 + 1.4), or 3.9 V.  
Working out the LED voltages, there are three 390 Ω resistors in series 
with another adjustable (5 kΩ) resistor at the bottom. Assuming the bottom 
resistor is set to 2 kΩ, the total resistance is 390 + 390 + 390 + 2000 = 3170 
Ω. So, the resistor current is the reference voltage (3.9 V) divided by the total 
resistance, or about 3.9/(390 + 390 + 390 + 2000) equals 1.23 mA. This 
gives us about 0.00123×2000 = 2.46 V for the bottom LED, and about 
0.00123×390 = 0.48 V for each step above the bottom. So, the LEDs should 
light at steps of 2.46, 2.94, 3.42, and 3.9. A fully charged cell phone battery is 
about 4.2 volts. You can adjust the 5.6 kΩ resistor to set the top voltage higher 
or lower, and adjust the lower 5 kΩ resistor to set the bottom LED for the 
lowest voltage. But you do need a 6 to 12 V or greater battery to power the 
circuit.

10.11 Analog Timing Light Project 
This analog timing light project (Fig. 10.11.1) uses RC circuit as a delay 
OFF timer to control the duration an incandescent light turns ON. When the 
accuracy of a timer is not critical, the use of RC circuit is a good choice as it is 
more cost effective and simple. Once the normally open switch SW is 
pressed, the light will turn ON for duration of 10 - 20 seconds before it turns 
OFF. The duration of the turn ON time can be varied by varying the values of 
R1, R2 and C2. 
 
Fig. 10.11.1 Analog timing light circuit 
When SW is pressed, the base of the transistor Q1 is forward biased and 
it turns ON. This turns ON the 12 V relay that is connected to the transistor. 
The contact of the relay RLY must be able to withstand the current of the load. 
At the same time, the electrolytic capacitor C2 is being charged to a voltage of 
approximately 0.7 V. 
Once SW is released, C2 will discharge through resistor R2 and the base 
of the transistor. After some time, when the voltage across C2 drops to 
approximately 0.5 V, the transistor will turn OFF. This in turn will cause the 
relay to turn OFF and the incandescent light will turn OFF. The timing of the 
turn OFF can be changed by changing the values of C2, R1 and R2.

10.12 Doorbell Memory Circuit Diagram  
If you’re expecting an important visitor but you just have to step out for a 
moment, an electronic doorbell memory can come in handy so you can see 
whether someone rang while you were out. Of course, you can’t tell whether 
it was the visitor you were expecting who dropped by then, but a call to the 
mobile phone of the person concerned can quickly answer that question. A 
doorbell memory can also save you the trouble of going to the front door (if 
you live upstairs) when you think you heard the bell but aren’t sure. And if 
you can’t buy one, then of course you can build one yourself!  
It takes only a handful of electronic components to build a handy tale-tale 
with an LED that indicates whether someone pressed the button of your 
doorbell. How many times have you thought you heard your doorbell while 
watching television in the evening? The sound of the well-known ‘ding–dong’ 
chimes occurs all too often, especially during the many commercials that 
nowadays remind us at the most inconvenient times that the gripping film 
we’re watching is only a fantasy. 
A glance at the LED of the doorbell memory will tell you whether you 
have to go to the door or can try to escape the ads by zapping to a different 
channel. Or if you’re expecting someone but have to make a quick trip to the 
neighbors to borrow a few beers for the occasion, it can be handy to be able 
to see whether your visitor already arrived while you were out. If so, you can 
always call him or her on the mobile to confess that you hadn’t properly 
prepared for the expected visit. 
The circuit (Fig. 10.12.1) is as simple as it is effective. It is connected in 
parallel with the bell and powered by a 3 V supply formed by two 1.5 V 
penlight batteries connected in series. The doorbell memory draws so little 
K h a l i l   I s m a i l o v 
 148 
current that a set of batteries will last several years in normal use. The circuit 
works as follows. When the supply voltage is switched on with switch S1, 
capacitor C1 (initially uncharged) prevents transistors T1 and T2 from 
conducting. LED D2 is off, and the memory is armed. 
 
 
 
Fig. 10.12.1 Doorbell memory circuit schematic 
 
When the doorbell button is pressed, the memory circuit receives an AC 
or DC voltage via diode D1, depending on the type of doorbell. It can handle 
either type. Transistor T1 thus receives a base current, so it starts conducting 
and drives T2 into conduction. The LED lights up as an indication that the 
doorbell has rung (i.e. was energized). The combination of transistor T2 and 
resistor R3 keeps T1 conducting after the bell voltage goes away (when the 
button is no longer pressed). 
The memory remains in this state until switch S1 is opened. This switch 
thus acts as a reset switch as well as a power switch. The circuit can be 
assembled compactly on a small piece of perforated prototyping board, so it 
can be fitted into just about any model of doorbell. The transistors can be 
replaced by other, equivalent types as long as you use a combination of NPN 
and PNP types.

Flashing eyes circuit (Fig. 10.13.1) was purposely designed as a funny 
Halloween gadget. It should be placed to the rear of a badge or pin bearing a 
typical Halloween character image, e.g. a pumpkin, skull, black cat, witch, 
ghost etc. Two LEDs are fixed in place of the eyes of the character and will 
shine more or less brightly following the rhythm of the music or speech 
picked-up from surroundings by a small microphone. Two transistors provide 
the necessary amplification and drive the LEDs.

Notes: 
Any general purpose, small signal transistor can be used for Q1 and Q2,

Q1. For medium gain transistors, the suggested value should do the job. High 
gain transistors will require a lower value for R3, i.e. about 390 - 470 Ω. You 
K h a l i l   I s m a i l o v 
 150 
can substitute R3 with a 1 kΩ trimmer in order to set precisely the threshold of 
the circuit.  
Any LED type and color can be used, but small, 2 mm diameter, high 
efficiency LEDs will produce a better effect.  
No limiting resistors are required for D1 and D2 even if this could seem 
incorrect.  
Stand-by current consumption of the circuit is about 1.5 mA.  
Depending on dimensions of your badge, you can choose from a wide 
variety of battery types: 2×1.5 V batteries type: AA, AAA, AAAA, button 
clock-type, photo-camera type and others, 2×1.4 V mercury batteries, button 
clock-type.

10.14. Electronic Candle Blow out Schematic  
This design was developed by request of a correspondent having made a 
sort of LED candle and needing to switch off the LED with a puff. This simple, 
easy to build gadget (Fig. 10.14.1) can be useful as a prop for Halloween and 
Christmas season, shows and the like. Q2 and Q3 form a self-latching pair that 
start operating when P1 is pushed: in this way the LED (or bulb) will 
illuminate steadily. When someone emits a strong puff in the vicinity of the 
small electret microphone. The resulting signal will be greatly amplified by 
Q1 and a rather long positive pulse (shaped by D1 and C2) will reset the self 
latching pair through the emitter of Q2. The very low (and unusual) value of 
C1 acts as a simple high-pass filter, in order to prevent that normal speech or 
environmental noise shut off the device. Obviously, such a simple filter 
cannot be very discriminating, therefore, not only a strong puff will reset the 
circuit but also a loud shout, blow, clap or stroke.

Notes: 
A small bulb can be used in place of the LED. In this case a 3 - 3.5 V, 0.7 
W (200 mA) incandescent bulb can be used satisfactorily. Therefore, D2, R5 
and R6 must be omitted, the bulb wired in place of R5 and R4 value changed 
to 1.5 kΩ.  
Using a bulb instead of the LED, a 1.5 V battery supply could also be 
used. A 1.5 V, 0.3 A incandescent bulb will work, but R4 must be replaced by 
a 470 Ω Trimmer, adjusted to allow a reliable circuit operation.  
Please note that the circuit will draw a small current even when the LED 
or bulb are off. This current is about 1.2 mA for the LED version of the circuit, 
1.5 mA for the 3 V bulb version and 1 mA for the 1.5 V bulb version. 
Therefore, in some circumstances, the addition of a power on-off switch could 
be necessary.

10.15. Low Cost-Automatic Emergency Light Electronic               
Circuit Diagram 
Here is a white-LED-based emergency light that offers the following 
advantages: 
1. It is highly bright due to the use of white LEDs. 
K h a l i l   I s m a i l o v 
 152 
2. The light turns on automatically when mains supply fails, and turns off 
when mains power resumes. 
3. It has its own battery charger. When the battery is fully charged, 
charging stops automatically. 
The low cost-automatic emergency light electronic circuit (Fig. 10.15.1) 
comprises two sections: charger power supply and LED driver. The charger 
power supply section is built around 3-terminal adjustable regulator (IC1) 
LM317, while the LED driver section is built around transistor BD140 (T2). In 
the charger power supply section, input AC mains is stepped down by 
transformer to deliver 9 V, 500 mA to the bridge rectifier, which comprises 
diodes (1N4007×4). Filter capacitor (25 V/1000 µF) eliminates ripples. 
Unregulated DC voltage is fed to input pin 3 of IC1 and provides charging 
current through diode 1N4007 (D5) and limiting resistor (16 Ω) R16. By 
adjusting preset 2.2 kΩ (VR1), the output voltage can be adjusted to deliver 
the required charging current. When the battery gets charged to 6.8 V, zener 
diode conducts and charging current from regulator (IC1) finds a path through 
transistor BC547 (T1) to ground and it stops charging of the battery.

The LED driver section uses a total of twelve 10 mm white LEDs. All the 
LEDs are connected in parallel with a 100 Ω resistor in series with each. The 
common-anode junction of all the twelve LEDs is connected to the collector 
of PNP transistor T2 and the emitter of transistor T2 is directly connected to 
the positive terminal of 6 V battery. The unregulated DC voltage, produced at 
the cathode junction of Bridge (Diodes), is fed to the base of transistor T2 
through a 1 kΩ resistor. When mains power is available, the base of transistor 
T2 remains high and T2 does not conduct. Thus LEDs are off. On the other 
hand, when mains fails, the base of transistor T2 becomes low and it 
conducts. This makes all the LEDs (LED1 through LED12) glow. The mains 
power supply, when available, charges the battery and keeps the LEDs off as 
transistor T2 remains cut-off. During mains failure, the charging section stops 
working and the battery supply makes the LEDs glow.  
Assemble the circuit on a general-purpose printed circuit board (PCB) and 
enclose in a cabinet with enough space for battery and switches. Mount the 
LEDs on the cabinet such that they light up the room. A hole in the cabinet 
should be drilled to connect 230 V AC input for the primary of the 
transformer. The circuit have been tested with twelve 10 mm white LEDs. 
More LEDs may be used when the total current consumption not more than 
1.5 A is provided. Driver transistor T2 can deliver up to 1.5 A with proper 
heat-sink arrangement.

10.16 Discrete Multistage Light Sequencer 
The drawing in Fig. 10.16.1 illustrates a multistage light sequencer using 
discrete parts and no integrated circuits. The idea is to connect the lights so 
that as one turns off it causes the next to turn on, and so forth. This is 
accomplished with a large capacitor between each stage that charges when a 
stage turns off and supplies base current to the next transistor, thus turning it 
on. Any number of stages can be used and the drawing in Fig. 10.16.1 
illustrates 3 small Christmas lights running at about 5 V and 200 mA. The 
circuit may need to be manually started when power is applied. To start it, 
connect a momentary short across any one of the capacitors and then remove 
the short. You could use a manual push button to do this.  
Assume the circuit doesn't start when power is applied and all lights are 
off and all three capacitors are charged to about 5 V. We connect a jumper 
across the 220 ΩF capacitor on the left which discharges the capacitor and 
turns on the 2nd stage transistor and corresponding light. When the jumper is 
K h a l i l   I s m a i l o v 
 154 
removed, the capacitor will start charging through the base of the stage 2 
transistor and stage 1 light. This causes the stage 2 transistor to remain on 
while the capacitor continues to charge. At the same time, the capacitor 
connecting stage 2 and 3 will discharge through the 100 Ω resistor and diode 
and stage 2 transistor. When the capacitor charging current falls below what is 
needed to keep stage 2 turned on, the transistor and light will turn off causing 
the voltage at the collector of the stage 2 transistor to rise to 5 V. Since the 
capacitor connecting stage 2 and 3 has discharged and the voltage rises at the 
collector of stage 2, the capacitor from stage 2 and 3 will charge causing the 
3rd stage to turn on and the cycle repeats for successive stages 4, 5, 6, 7, .... 
and back to 1. The sequence rate is determined by the capacitor and resistor 
values (220 µF and 100 Ω in this case), load current (200 mA in this case), and 
current gain of the particular transistor used. This arrangement runs at about 
120 complete cycles per minute for 3 lights, or about 167 ms per light. Faster 
or slower rates can be obtained with different capacitor values.

10.17 Simple Fire Alarm with NE555 Circuit Diagram 
This is a simple fire alarm circuit. (Fig. 10.17.1) based NE555 timer and 
use thermistor as temperature sensor. This sensor will activate the transistor 
when the temperature is in high value. 
The thermistor offers a low resistance at high temperature and high 
resistance at low imperature. This phenomenon is employed here for sensing 
the fire. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The IC1 (NE555) is configured as a free running oscillator at audio 
frequency. The transistors T1 and T2 drive IC1. The output (pin 3) of IC1 is 
coupled to base of transistor T3 (SL100), which drives the speaker to generate 
alarm sound. The frequency of NE555 depends on the values of resistances R5 
and R6 and capacitance C2. When thermistor becomes hot, it gives a low-
resistance path for the positive voltage to the base of transistor T1 through 
diode D1 and resistance R2. 
Capacitor C1 charges up to the positive supply voltage and increases the 
time for which the alarm is ON. The larger the value of C1, the larger the 
positive bias applied to the base of transistor T1 (BC548). As the collector of 
T1 is coupled to the base of transistor T2, the transistor T2 provides a positive 
voltage to pin 4 (reset) of IC1 (NE555). Resistor R4 is selected so that NE555 
keeps inactive in the absence of the positive voltage. Diode D1 stops 
discharging of capacitor C1 when the thermistor is in connection with the 
positive supply voltage cools out and provides a high resistance path. It also 
inhibits the forward biasing of transistor T1.

10.18 Two Transistor LED Flasher 
Two transistor LED flasher circuit (Fig. 10.18.1) will flash a bright red 
(5000 mcd) as an attention getting device or take car alarm. Component 
values are not critical and other transistors may be used. Flash duration is 
determined by R2 and C1 and is approximately 3 time constant (3×R2×C1). 
Brightness is controlled by R3 which limits the LED current to about 20 
milliamperes for values listed. R1 provides bias for the transistors which 
should be low enough not to saturate Q2 with the capacitor disconnected. If 
the circuit does not oscillate, R1 may be too low or R2 may be too high. D1 
allows for higher duty cycle operation and limits the reverse voltage at the 
base of Q1 to –0.7 V. D1 may be omitted for low voltage (3-9) and low duty 
cycle operation.

10.19 Multivibrator Flasher 
A multivibrator circuit shown in Fig. 10.19.1 is suitable for 6 V or greater. 
Protective diodes have been added to prevent emitter-base reverse breakdown 
which may occur with higher power supply voltages. Reverse DC voltage 
spikes approaching that of the power supply voltage may occur each time the 
transistor switches OFF and in the worst case scenario; they can damage the 
transistor or in the best case scenario will have no effect or possibly just 
decrease the time OFF of the transistor. The minimum emitter-base 
breakdown voltage of a 2N3904 is 6 V. The reverse breakdown voltage of a 
small-signal diode such as the 1N4148 or 1N914 is probably 100 V. 
Protective diodes may be added to basic multivibrator circuit different ways 
and both of these methods are shown in Fig. 10.19.1 as circled 1 or 2.  
 
Fig. 10.19.1 A multivibrator circuit 
In the circuit 10.19.1(a) the protective diode slightly increases the 
collector-emitter saturation voltage and decreases the collector current by the 
small voltage drop across the diode (0.6 V for a silicon diode). In the circuit 
10.19.1(b), during the part of the cycle when the transistor base normally goes 
negative, just the anode of the protective diode will go negative and not the 
transistor base.  
To make a better looking flasher, a multivibrator may be used as the timer 
and leave the work of switching the LEDs on and off by auxiliary circuits 
K h a l i l   I s m a i l o v 
 158 
called half-shots, which are in essence, 1/2 of a regular multivibrator. The take 
off points of the basic timer multivibrator are on each collector and are 
indicated as the A or B. The use of the basic multivibrator in Fig. 10.19.1 as 
flasher circuit, simply 1 or more LEDs are simply added to each collector of 
circuits of Fig. 10.19.1,  may be tweak each current limiting resistor and your 
done. 
The circuit shown in Fig. 10.19.2(a) is the basic half-shot circuit. While it 
is subjective and dependent on timing resistor and capacitor values, the flash 
effect is more pleasant. Instead of one LED being OFF while the other is ON, 
they have a slight overlap or independence, which better simulates an 
emergency vehicle flash. 
To augment this effect further, an additional half-shot was added for a 
total of 2 LEDs connected to each 1/2 of the basic timer multivibrator. The 
second half-shot circuit was altered to improve its output waveform by adding 
a diode and a resistor. In a traditional multivibrator, the leading edge of the 
output waveform is usually not square. This is because the collector voltage 
does not immediately jump to its highest potential (at or approaching 12 V in 
our example) when the transistor is switched OFF. The capacitor connected to 
the collector must charge through the collector resistor and this causes a delay 
due to the time constant (the product) of the collector R and the C connected 
to it. By adding a diode to block the normal capacitor charging current path 
and a separate resistor to charge the capacitor, the collector voltage will 
instantly rise to its supply level when the transistor is switched OFF. This 
provides a more rectangular shaped output waveform which may improve 
switching (especially when cascading more 1/2 shots). The cascaded half-shot 
circuit is shown in the Fig. 10.19.2(b). Connect either the Basic 1/2 shot or the 
Cascaded 1/2 shot circuit to each collector of the basic timer multivibrator 
(such as circuit 1 or circuit 2 from Fig. 10.19.1). Additional stages can be 
added. The diodes connected to the base of transistors function as a protective 
diodes.

10.20 Basic Astable 555 Timer IC Flasher 
2 LEDs can be alternately flashed with a 555 integrated circuit configured 
as shown in Fig. 10.20.1. The combination of a 2.2 kΩ and 47 kΩ resistors 
determine the oscillation frequency along with the 10 µF capacitor connected 
to pins 2 and 6. You can practically change the (R Speed) 47 kΩ value to 
between 10 kΩ and 100 kΩ or more. Greater resistance = lower speed. You 
may also wish to connect up a 100 kΩ or so potentiometer instead of the 47 
kΩ resistor for a variable speed version. Additionally, the 10 µF capacitor 
value can be changed.

10.21 9 V Siren (Alarm) Circuit Diagram 
Using this circuit diagram you can make a very powerful siren powered 
by just a 9 V battery. 
This circuit may provide the final building block in an alarm circuit using 
a relay to activate it. This siren circuit is very simple and is constructed using 
common electronic components. 
When the switch is pressed C3 charges up through R4 with a time 
constant of 0.47 seconds and when the switch is released C3 begins a slower 
E l e c r t r o n i c s  
 161 
discharge through R7 and R3 with a time constant of about 5 seconds. The op-
amp 358 used in this project is set up as a voltage controlled oscillator. 
When the output of the oscillator (pin 7) switches low there is a charge 
remaining in C1 which holds pin 5 below the switching point. Current 
through R7 is proportional to the control voltage on C3. This current 
discharges C1 causing the voltage on pin 5 to rise towards the switching point 
at a rate proportional to the voltage on C3. When the switching point is 
reached pin 7 switches high and initially pulls pin 6 high via C1. This causes 
the op-amp to temporarily turn on hard. But C3 quickly recharges through D2 
causing the voltage on pin 5 to fall below the switching point and causing the 
op-amp to switch off again. 
 
The positive pulse output from the op-amp puts a fixed amount of charge 
into C2 slightly raising the potential of pin 6. This causes the potential on pin 
6 to rise and assist the sharp switch off of the op-amp. Also R5 and C2 delay 
the rise on pin 6 long enough to get a good output pulse. 
For this siren (alarm) circuit you need a 9 V battery (or a power supply) 
and a 8 Ω speaker.

10.22 Police Siren Project 
This police siren simulated electronic project (Fig. 10.22.1) uses two 555 
timers IC to generate a sound similar to the police siren. A single 556 timer IC 
which consists of two 555 timers can also be used. In this circuit, both of the 
timers are configured as astable circuit. The first timer is configured as a 
square wave close to 1 Hz astable oscillator. The output of this timer is used 
to feed the control voltage of the second timer where it is subjected to 
frequency modulation. This frequency modulation will generate a tone similar 
to the siren used by the police. The frequency of this tone generator can be 
varied by changing the value of potentiometer VR1. When set to its maximum 
value of 220 kΩ, it will have a tone frequency of approximately 320 Hz.  
 
Fig. 10.22.1 Police siren simulated electronic circuit diagram 
 
When S1 is switched ON, the circuit will be powered ON and U1 will 
start to oscillate at a frequency given by the formula: 
f = 1.44/[(R1 + 2R2)(E1)] = 1.44/[(10 + 2×82)(10)] Hz = 0.8 Hz 
This output frequency from pin 3 of U1 is fed into pin 5 of U2 where it is 
subjected to frequency modulation through resistor 10 kΩ. The tone generated 
can be varied by changing the values of potentiometer VR1. Experiment with 
the sound and settle with the best sound of your choice. The output of U2 is

used to drive a power transistor which in turn drives an 8 Ω speaker. Diode

The 555 on the right is wired as an alarm sound generator and the second

10.24 Cat and Dog Repellent  
The electronic dog repellent circuit diagram (Fig. 10.24.1) is a high output 
ultrasonic transmitter which is primarily intended to act as a dog and cat 
repeller, which can be used individuals to act as a deterrent against some 
animals. It should NOT be relied upon as a defense against aggressive dogs 
but it may help distract them or encourage them to go away and do not 
consider this as an electronic pest repeller. The ultrasonic dog repellant uses a 
standard 555 timer IC1 set up as an oscillator using a single RC network to 
give a 40 kHz square wave with equal mark/space ratio. 
 
 
Fig. 10.24.1 Cat and Dog Repellent Circuit Diagram 
This frequency is above the hearing threshold for humans but is known to 
be irritating frequency for dog and cats. Since the maximum current that a 555 
timer can supply is 200 mA an amplifier stage was required. So a high-power 
H-bridge network was devised, formed by 4 transistors TR1 to TR4. A second 
timer IC2 forms a buffer amplifier that feeds one input of the H-bridge driver, 
with an inverted waveform to that of IC1 output being fed to the opposite 
input of the H-bridge. 
E l e c r t r o n i c s  
 165 
This means that conduction occurs through the complementary pairs of 
TR1/TR4 and TR2/TR3 on alternate marks and spaces, effectively doubling the 
voltage across the ultrasonic transducer, LS1. This is optimised to generate a 
high output at ultrasonic frequencies. This configuration was tested by 
decreasing the frequency of the oscillator to an audible level and replacing the 
ultrasonic transducer with a loudspeaker; the results were astounding. If the 
dog repellent circuit was fed by a bench power supply rather than a battery 
that restrict the available current, the output reached 110 dB with 4 A running 
through the speaker which is plenty loud enough! 
The Dog and Cat repellant was activated using a normal open switch S1 
to control the current consumption, but many forms of automatic switching 
could be used such as pressure sensitive mats, light beams or passive infrared 
sensors. Thus it could be utilise as part of a dog or cat deterrent system to help 
prevent unwanted damage to gardens or flowerbeds, or a battery powered 
version can be carried for portable use. Consider also using a lead-acid battery 
if desired, and a single chip version could be built using the 556 dual timer IC 
to save space and improve battery life.

10.25 Fading Red Eyes 
Fading red eyes circuit (Fig. 10.25.1) is used to slowly illuminate and fade 
a pair of red LEDs (light emitting diodes). The fading LEDs could be installed 
as 'eyes' in a small pumpkin or skull as a Halloween attraction, or mounted in 
a Christmas tree ornament. Or, they might be used as a fancy power indicator 
for your computer, microwave oven, stereo system, TV, or other appliance.

In operation, a linear 3 volt (peak to peak) ramping waveform is generated 
at pin 1 of the LM1458 IC and buffered with an emitter follower transistor 
stage. The 22 µF capacitor and 47 kΩ resistor connected to pin 2 establish the 
frequency which is about 0.5 Hz. You can make the rate adjustable by using a 
100 kΩ pot in place of the 47 kΩ resistor at pin 2. 
The circuit consists of two operational amplifiers (op-amps), one producing 
a slow rising and falling voltage from about 3 volts to 6 volts, and the other 
(on the right) is used as a voltage comparator, the output of which supplies a 
alternating voltage switching between 2 and 7 volts to charge and discharge 
the capacitor with a constant current. 
Each of the op-amps has one of the inputs (pins 3 and 6) tied to a fixed 
voltage established by two 47 kΩ resistors so that the reference is half the 
supply voltage or 4.5 volts. The left op-amp is connected as an inverting 
amplifier with a capacitor placed between the output (pin 1) and the inverting 
input (pin 2). The right op-amp is connected as a voltage comparator so that 
the output on pin 7 will be low when the input is below the reference and 
high when the input is higher than the reference. A 100 kΩ resistor is 
connected between the comparator output and input to provide positive 
feedback and pulls the input above or below the switching point when the 
threshold is reached. 
When the comparator output changes at pin 7, the direction of the 
current changes through the capacitor which in turn causes the inverting op-
amp to move in the opposite direction. This yields a linear ramping waveform 
or triangle waveform at pin 1 of the inverting op-amp. 
It is always moving slowly up or down, so that the voltage on the non-
inverting input stays constant at 4.5 volts.

APPENDIX C 
Resistor Color Coding 
The stripes on a resistor tell the resistance value and its tolerance. The 
color rings are grouped towards one end of the resistor; start reading from that 
same end. The color of the first ring indicates the first digit of the resistance 
value, and the second ring the second digit. The third ring indicates the power 
of ten that this value had to be multiplied with. A fourth ring indicates the 
tolerance on this value; if no fourth ring is present, the tolerance defaults to 
±20%. See Table 1 for a key to the color code: 
 
Only a limited number of resistor values are manufactured; a tolerance of 
10% on the resistor value for example suggests the following sequence of 
manufactured resistor values: 10, 12, 15, 18, 22, 27, 33, 39, 47, 56, 68, and 
82 (times some power of 10). Make sure you understand why this is! 
Resistor values are encoded as colour codes. Here we are talking about 3 
band resistor colour coding system and how to remember it easily.  
The number starts from 0 and ends at 9. Let’s take the first letter of each colour 
B B R O Y G B V G W (0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9). Here is an easy way to remember it 
” B.B ROY of Great Britain had a Very Good Wife”

APPENDIX D 
Capacitor Color Coding 
For capacitors there is no such color code. There essentially are two and 
three number codes, sometimes followed by a letter for the tolerance. If a 
voltage is printed on the capacitor, the capacitor is rated up to that voltage; if 
higher voltage is applied, it will fail. Codes of the form Letter-Number-Letter 
refer to temperature tolerance and dependence (for more detail look at e.g. 
http://xtronics.com/kits/ccode.htm). Here comes how to read the two or three 
digit number codes. The basic unit of measure is the pF. Two number codes 
directly translate into pF capacitance, with the two digits representing the two 
significant digits in that measure. Thus an imprint of 47 means 47 pF. If three 
digits are given, the third digit represents a multiplier much like the third ring 
on a resistor. The two tables below list the multipliers as well as the optional 
tolerance letter that may follow the capacitor code: 
Capacitor codes: 
 
Thus a capacitor marked 104 has a capacitance of 10×10,000 pF = 0.1 
µF. A 47K is a 47 pF capacitor with a 10% tolerance. A 472J is a 4.7 nF 
capacitor with a 5% tolerance. Large capacitors will have their capacitance 
printed on them directly. A capacitance meter (on the MASTECH MY-64 and 
MY-68 DMMs) is available in the lab.
