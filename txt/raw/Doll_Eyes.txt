Quiapo is a labyrinth of stores that sells everything from the mundane — such as stolen cell 
phones and seventy-five-peso slippers — to the arcane. 
In one of these shops, there was 
a doll maker with a bat-winged 
store. And her brand of magic was 
the sinister kind. 
Manang Bolabola would sit 
outside her little shop, eyes half-
closed, as if sleeping. But the truth 
was she saw, smelled, and heard 
everything. She was watching 
and waiting for the right kind of 
material to make her dolls with.
Her dolls looked ordinary 
enough. Piles of plastic dolls  with 
blinking blue or brown eyes were 
on display together with orange, 
purple and white teddy bears, as 
well as heart-shaped pillows, and 
pink pigs with curly tails.
Manang Bolabola had a secret 
collection, however, hidden away 
at the back of the store. 
The hidden dolls were very 
beautiful and made of costly 
materials like delicate porcelain 
and rich ivory. Their most 
marvelous feature was their eyes. 
Each doll’s eye was a precious 
gemstone. 
One would have 
eyes the color of 
sunshine trapped in 
amber while another, 
moonlight glowing 
from a dark, velvet 
gaze. Yet another 
would have the 
echoing remains of 
rainbow-twinkling 
laughter, and 
another, a gentle 
whisper of the most 
serene blue.
Each doll was 
unique. Not one was 
for sale.
She scanned the crowd. 
There.
The doll maker sensed the little 
girl. Alone. A street urchin. One 
of seven kids. Blood ties broken. 
Hurting, hurting, hurting…
Manang Bolabola licked her 
lips. Yes. This one was ripe for 
the picking.
With a wave of her hand, 
she beckoned the little girl to 
come over. Obediently, the child 
approached.
“What is it, lola?”
The doll maker smiled, 
whispered in the girl’s ear, and 
drew back the curtains of the shop 
entrance. The girl stepped inside.
When Manang Bolabola came 
out, there was a new doll in her 
secret room, with eyes the color of 
twilight that had been grazed by the 
twinkle of the first evening star.
In the streets and stalls of 
Quiapo, flowers are sold in bulk 
at the lowest prices. Tin and other 
sampaguita vendors got their 
daily supply of the sweet-smelling 
flowers here. 
It was January. Competition was 
tough as people are less likely to 
buy after the holidays.
Tin worried about Ella.
The girls shared a very special 
bond, maybe because they were 
both born on Christmas day.  
They looked out for each other 
and always knew each other’s 
thoughts and feelings, even 
without speaking.
Tin hoped Ella was not in 
trouble. But she had not seen 
her since yesterday and she 
could not quell the uneasy 
feeling in her heart.
In the secret room, the 
shelves were filled with 
dolls of every shape and 
size. Many of the girls  were 
in Maria Clara dresses 
and baro’t saya while the 
boys were in barong. A few 
wore exotic, tribal clothing. 
There were also some in 
Western-style clothes, 
kimonos, and cheongsams.
Ella could see her ivory 
hands and a cry began to 
rise from her porcelain 
throat — but the scream 
was frozen inside and no 
one could hear her. No  
one, that is, except her 
fellow dolls. 
You do not want to call the attention 
of the doll maker.    
Ella heard a voice in her head and 
she knew it was the doll beside her.
She might harvest your eyes, warned 
another voice.
“Harvest my eyes?” Ella wondered.
She collects us for our souls, the 
voices continued to 
explain. The essence of it 
is in our eyes and when 
she has need of it, she 
harvests them and then we 
are no more.
Ella shuddered. You still 
move. Somebody still thinks of 
you.
That was when Ella felt her 
own fingers bend somewhat, 
though she could not clench 
them in her fear and anger.
“What happens when you 
are forgotten?”
You are frozen forever. There is 
no chance of escape.
“How?” Ella asked. “How 
can we escape?”
We do not know. The voices 
then fell silent for a long time.
Tin woke up in a cold 
sweat, gulping in lungfuls 
of air, trying not to scream. 
In her dream, she had been 
frozen and was unable to 
move. Instinctively, she knew. 
Ella, where are you?
 In the chilly, predawn 
darkness, Tin dressed. She 
had no idea where to go 
or what to do, but she felt 
compelled to move. 
I must find Ella.
Although she was 
early, there was a 
mass of people already 
milling about. Tin 
remembered then that 
it was the feast of the 
Black Nazarene. In 
that chaos, Tin knew it was 
more likely that she would 
get crushed and trampled on, 
rather than find her missing 
friend. Silently, she begged the 
heavens for help. 
 She walked among the 
stalls and stores calling for 
Ella in her mind. How she 
knew where to go, she could 
not explain. 
Before she knew it, she was standing 
in front of a store with plastic dolls, teddy 
bears, and curly-tailed pigs. Despite the 
ordinariness of the shop’s appearance, 
the hairs on her nape stood on end, 
warning her. 
Outside, an old woman sat on a 
stool, sleeping. 
Something inside her warned her 
to be very, very careful.
When she bumped into a 
tall, dark man, she almost gave 
a shout. But the man with the 
thorny-looking hat had the 
kindest eyes and she knew that 
he was there to help. He put 
his finger to his lips and placed 
something in her hand. 
It was a plastic water gun 
filled with a blood-colored liquid. 
Before she could ask or thank 
him, he was gone.
Carefully, Tin made her way 
to the back of the shop, lifted the 
flap and crawled underneath.
Immediately, Tin felt 
suffocated. She felt watched 
by hundreds of eyes as fear 
rooted her legs in place. 
 She heard the soft swish of a 
curtain. “Hello,” the doll maker 
grinned. “Admiring my doll 
collection, I see. Not very nice 
of you, sneaking in. All you had 
to do was ask and I would have 
warmly welcomed you.”
 The hairs on the back of 
Tin’s neck wanted to pop out 
of their roots, but something 
in the old lady’s voice was 
strangely compelling.
“Would you like some 
chocolate, love?”  
Tin’s first instinct was to say 
no, but the woman looked kindly 
at her.
“If you eat this,” she continued, 
“you will never be cold   or 
hungry again. You will no longer 
have to work or study. You will be 
beautiful, wear pretty clothes, and 
make many new friends.”
Tin felt her fear fade. 
Slowly, she reached for 
the chocolate. Then the 
room became heavy 
again, as hundreds 
of unheard screams 
weighed down on 
her shoulders. 
“Go on, my dear, 
take a bite.”
Tin bit halfway into 
the chocolate and as the sweet 
melted on her tongue, Ella’s voice 
was suddenly in her head.   
STOP!
And she remembered 
her quest — and the 
water gun! She pointed 
the toy at the crone and 
squeezed before her 
fingers began to stiffen. 
Tin blacked out to the 
sounds of one old lady’s 
terrible scream and a 
multitude of children’s 
voices shouting, 
shouting, shouting…
When she awoke, Tin 
was outside the stall. Ella 
was beside her. 
“What happened?”
“Everyone has 
gone their way.” Ella 
explained that the dolls 
were now real children again.
“The old woman?”
“Whatever was in your gun 
wrapped itself around her 
and bound her tightly,” Ella 
whispered in awe.
“Then what?”
Ella pointed to a ratty, old rag doll with black button eyes atop the teddy bears.
“That’s her,” Ella shrugged.
“Okay,” said Tin.
The girls then held hands, walked away, and disappeared into the crowds of Quiapo.
