That Dabir Mahsati, that pure of soul 
Sanjar positioned her close to his throne.  
Although her face did not resemble the 
Moon the Shah displayed deep sympathy for her. 

Yesterday a nightingale played again the lyre,  
The cuckoo opened the way to the heart   
through the lute. 
 Today, the crow threw the rebick into the  
water my friend, 
Tomorrow the turtle-dove will play  
the flute for you.  
 
I am Mahsati and I am above all  beauty,  
I am famous in Khorasan and Iraq. 
O, Son of Khatib-  
Let me not be consumed in the fire of separation. 
Yesterday fresh a tulip was aflame in Nishapur,  
Todayfrom the river Marv water lilies sparng. 
Today the wind of brought forth flowers, 
 Tomorow the earth of Balkh will  
be full of fragrance! 
 
Though my life passed in foreign 
     lands in sorrow, 
My state would not be known to my enemies. 
I consoled myself by saying these word, 
 I do not wish the fox witness  
    . 
For ghazals of Sati and Mahsati 
You give a hundred treasures every night.

The path of religion is visible, but where is  
the loyal believer?  
I see one world full of lovers, but where is the  
   lover who shares the sorrow? 
 
Ganja goes, in the same ryhme: 
  
-
In the world of love  the Pronuncement  
is in her name; 
The dawn of lovers emerges from  
the night of his beard 
Reason compares his beard to musk 
I say, it is a mistak musj is a slave to it. 

That woman in her 90th year has still preserved 
    her strength,  
Her white long hair has still preserved 
its luster. 
 

Happy the person who puts his face next to yours, 
A hundred knights can not do what  
your castle does. 
No wonder if I am chekmated,  
you are my play mate 
 
your face (castle) or my game? 
 


Sappho, pure angel with violet hairs,  
My soul tries to fly out when you smile.  
My heart wishes to open you some secret,  
However decency prevents it, so I cannot do it. 
How long will you say Ganja, Ganja  
How long will you make suffer 
   the hearts of loners 
 
  my desire in Ganja 
And now here I am, here you are 
   and here is Ganja. 
 
  
Be sure that I am loyal to you till my death. 
Many are ready to die for you, 
But I want to burn in your love. 


Son of tailor, your face resembles the Moon,  
Hundreds of Mahsatis will turn to your servant 
I wish I get the way to your sweet lips for  
hundred times a day  
Like the string in your hand.
Cobbler each time adorns the shoe,  
His ruby touched the shoe, so amazing! 
 A shoe adorned by the lips like honey  
Would be the Sun crown in heavens,  
    my beloved. 
 
The baker beloved would give her contribution 
Not through ignorance, but through coquetry.  
He turned me to dough by the sorrow for him 
I fear that he will trust me into fire again. 
 
You, the man sieving the soil, I faded because  
   of your love, 
 I told nothing to anybody because of your grief. 
Every day I was seeking for you with  
   the gold in my palm, 
But you were seeking for gold  
   by sieving the soil.   
     
Parnasse oriental


You are butcher and I am your sacrifice, look, 
 I would stand until the knife reaches 
    the bone. 
It is custom that you sell what you cut, 
 
if you kill me. 
  
My beloved butcher adorned the shop  
with his existence, 
The people again circled him all around.  
 
When he put his hand on his sides  
    he used to say: 
Well done! What a rare hip, what a rare arm. 
Carpenter whose smiling lips resemble pistachio! 
His face is beautiful and bright  
like the shining Sun. 
Each time he started to carve wood, 
God knows there is no carver like him.

hi is the person who gathers around himself his 
colleagues in his occupation, various craftsmen, the 
single and lonely men, they also come themselves. 
 
fotowwa, 
 
 
 
This is a place for men who sacrifice their lives 
If you are not ready to sacrifice your life,  
     


The arena of word ought to be constantly vast, 
The enthusiasm should gallop its horse towards 
    four directions.

Since we ascended the pulpit if love  
We always told the love stories from 
text-book of love. 
We don   
  
When taking each breathe I remember you, 
 If I am far from you, forget the sorrow.  
If the world turn to water and is covered  
     with fire, 
 I would be a dust, let the wind bring me to you. 
 

The nights spent with you are gone, 
The pearl dropped from my eyes are gone 
You were calm of my heart and  joy of my soul, 
You are gone, and whatever I told you are gone.      


O son of Khatib of Ganja take this advice of me: 
Enjoy your days and fill the goblet of wine, 
God is not mindful of your sins 
Enjoy your life while you can. 
I said my lips are guest of your kiss, 
   
Mind came and put a finger on the lip, 
ry cheap, what are you  
    

Now what shall I say, what was done  
   by longing for you?! 
What was done by your ruse, by your hypocrisy, 
   by your discord?!  
I need a night as long as your strings,  
To tell you one by one what was done 
   by your parting?!   
 
     my darling, 
 
my darling. 
If someone sees you in his dream,  
Believe me, that I would die out of jealousy,  
my darling! 
 
The sense and beginning of world is love, 
 The first couplet of the song of youth is love.  
You, who is unaware of the world of love,  
Understand that the life itself is love. 
Love is able to make the lion weep,   
It is an ocean which contains wonders 
Sometimes it pleases your soul, 
 Sometimes it brings you sorrow and grief. 
You have no loyalty and love at all, 
Friend and enemy are the same for you, beauty.  
 
 
Complaining of you would give nothing,  
   it is enough!.. 
 Please, go, it would be better not   
   to open this matter. 
Idolatry is pleasant if your face is the idol,  
Drunkenness is pleasant if the glasses are filled 
   from your wine. 
  
 
w if my life will   
   fade with love.  
Disappearing with your love is thousand  
times better than existing, 

You failed to be bosom friend of sorrow, 
 
 
How can you be aware of the value of lover?! 
 
Day of misfortune would come soon or late. 
You are not exhausted of croqueting each time 
   you open your eyes 
That day neither my love nor your beauty  
   would survive. 
My beloved told me to take the glass, 
 
 
Lest you become depressed. 
   
Lest you are hurt by my eyelashes,  
 
 
I would keep you neither in my heart  
nor upon my eyes, 
I will keep you with my soul to be with me  
until the last breath.   
My soul is a nest for your sorrow  
   from the first day, 
This heart is eternal space for your sorrow. 
 I love my heart and soul 
Because I find sign of your sorrow in them. 
 
 I would have kept your secret from heart. 
 
  
     
I would have preserved the secret not only from 
   heart but also from soul.   
 
How should this unhappy heart have  
   known that 
It must have end with its hopes for joining you.  
I used to be joyful with you, time prevented it, 
I used to be happy with you, destiny  
   did not allow. 
 

I am screaming due to my old beloved and  
my mournful soul, 
I got inhabited of my constant scream  
   as a flute. 
Only friend loyal to my soul is sorrow,  
But in this palace  
I am in amity with impressive soul. 
 
Who am I? Lover of grief and sorrow,  
   a crazy woman, 
Who finds quiteness to be death if she  
   has no sorrow. 
I am unlucky person who lost her joy and  
   fragrancy of his life 
Like the bud that became pale  
   without opening.   
... Mahsati as a candle would not find the  
   loyal friend,  
Only tears and grieves are bosom 
    friends of hers.     
Drinking wine and being joyous is my way of life, 
Being free from both faith and heresy is my creed 
 
 
I asked the Bride of the World,  
 
 

My soul can hardly give up you,  
Although I can easily die because  
  of sufferings from you. 
I will neither give a room to other love  
  in my heart, 
 Nor search for other beloved. 
We should not be made a friend to the old man,  
Or should not be locked up in the room   
   oppressing the soul.  
The girl with strings like the chain, 
 Should not be kept with the chain 
    in the narrow cell. 
If the woman be a beloved of the old man, 
Her sorrow would never dicrease unless  
    she grows old. 
n  
 

I fell into a trap like a bird with broken wings,  
And nobody is aware of this.  
The deep grief branched out in my heart,  
For that reason I became very unhappy. 
 
 
Mercy has also melted up like the ice. 
The glade of generosity is overgrown with locust,  
Give up seeking for that rare boon.  
If you wander in the native land  
You can find neither smoky kitchen   
    nor the food. 

You have blasphemy in your soul.  
   Prayer or belief?  
This poison intoxicated you,  
   what can be helpful?  
Everywhere you introduced  
   yourself as an ascetic, 
If your passion is dirty, this will not be  
   helpful, understand! 

Eyes of my eyes on seeing your eyes,  
Your eyes expelled the sleep from my eyes at all. 
You eye is an eye of eyes and the light  
     of your eyes, 
My eyes did not see the eyes resembling  
     your eyes.  

That day tulip unsheathed its dagger  
   made from fire, 
Yesterday bind-wind dropped the shame  
tears from the eyes. 
Lylac mixed her aroma with soil  today,  
Wind, tear the armour from saman (grass) 
tomorrow morning. 




I went away, my heart will still  
   long remain here,  
 It will share my each sorrow here.  
 My body is leaving, but my soul 
 Will be delighted with your love here  
   as previously it was.
