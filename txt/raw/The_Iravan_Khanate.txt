AZERBAIJAN C O N T E N T S The relocation of Armenians to the lands of North Azerbaijan in the 19th century is an historical truth This book deals with one of the Azerbaijani states – the Iravan Khanate (1747-1828 )which has played an important role in the history of the South Caucasus.This Azerbaijani state struggled heroical ly against foreign invaders in the early 19th century.The history of the Iravan Khanate is an integral part of the rich material and moral cultural history of the Azerbaijani people,which has been formed for thousands of years.The Iravan Khanate is one of the Azerbaijani states or khanates established after the fall of the Nadir Shah Empire in the middle of the 18th century.The current territory of the Republic of Armenia was,in the recent past – the beginning of the 19th century-the Azerbaijani state of the Iravan Khanate.The original inhabitants of these lands were Azerbaijani Turks.17 F O R E W O R D THE RELOCATION OF ARMENIANS TO THE LANDS OF NORTH AZERBAIJAN IN THE 19TH CENTURY IS AN HISTORICAL TRUTH AZERBAIJAN NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES,A.A.BAKIKHANOV INSTITUTE OF HISTORY The territory where the Iravan Khanate was founded is ancient Turkic land.The Hurris,Kimmers,Iskits,Saxes,Huns and many other Oghuz and Qipchag Turks lived within this region,especially in the vicinity of Lake Göycha*.These ethnic groups contributed greatly to the formation of the Azerbaijani people and have left a rich historical and cultural heritage In “Kitabi-Dede Gorgud”,which is an heroic epic of the Azerbaijani and other Turkic peoples,some important historic events and processes took place precisely in this region of Azerbaijan – the Iravan Khanate.In Oghuzname,written by order of the great Azerbaijani ruler Uzun Hassan (1468 – 1478 ),in “Kitabi-Diyarbakriyya” by Abu Bakr Tehrani,speaks about Oghuz Khagan,from whom Oghuz Turks derive their genealogical background.He lived in the vicinity of Göycha sea,passed away and was buried there.The khan of khans,Bayandur Khagan and other Oghuz-Turkic warlords also lived,died and were buried in these lands.1 The territory of the Iravan Khanate has,from ancient times,been within Azerbaijani states,with the exception of periods of rule by seprate invading empires.These lands were one of the regions totally and densely inhabited by Azerbaijani-Turkic tribes.Up to the Russian occupations at the beginning of the 19th century the overwhelming majority of the population of the Iravan Khanate were Azerbaijani-Turks.It should be mentioned that until the Armenian church,with its Catholicos (head of the Armenian church)was transferred to the Iravan (Chukhursad )region in 1441,18 AZERBAIJAN NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES,A.A.BAKIKHANOV INSTITUTE OF HISTORY *After the establishment of the Armenian state in Western Azerbaijan in the territory of the former Iravan Khanate in 1918,the name of Lake Göycha was changed by theArmenians to “Sevan” in 1930 1.For more information see :Abubakr Tehrani.Kitabi –Diyarbakriyya.Author of the foreword,interpretation,indexes and translation from Persian by Rahila Shukurova.Baku,1998,p.46-47.F O R E W O R D THE RELOCATION OF ARMENIANS TO THE LANDS OF NORTH AZERBAIJAN IN THE 19TH CENTURY IS AN HISTORICAL TRUTH there were not any villages or pieces of land which belonged to Armenians.The lands of the Azerbaijani – Turks were taken apart,piece by piece,by the Armenians,even in Üchkilsa (Valarshabad*)where the Armenian church,with the Catholicos,has been located since 1443.** The Iravan Khanate,an Azerbaijani state ruled by the Khans of the famous Gajars of Turkic dynasty,played an important role in the history of Azerbaijani state governance.The governing system of the Khanate,its social,political,cultural and economic life,and the living standards of its inhabitants,were an integral part of the general historical development system of Azerbaijan,lasting thousands of years.The Iravan Khanate did not differ from other Azerbaijani khanates of the period in its characteristic features of development.In the territory of the Iravan Khanate there were many examples of the material culture of the Azerbaijani people.Settlements and cities were erected :thousands of historical monuments,fortresses,mosques,minarets ( prayer towers),caravanserais and baths were built.*** All the place-names in the region belonged to the Azerbaijani people.This undeniable truth has been confirmed even by Armenian sources.**** In the terrritory of the Khanate there were lots of ancient Oghuz-Turkic graveyards and in these grave-yards,there were many gravestone monuments,including gochbashi ( ram-head )statues typical of the Azerbaijani people.All of these bear the cultural and economic seals of the Azerbaijani people.19 AZERBAIJAN NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES,A.A.BAKIKHANOV INSTITUTE OF HISTORY *The place-name “Valarshabad” originates from Valar Shah (194-216),the son of Sanaturk (Sanatruk),who belonged to the dynasty of Arshakis ( Arsakhs).This place-name was for a long time known as “Valarshabad” but in Armenian sources it was distorted and became Vagharshabad”.The foundation of Valarshabad was laid by Valar Shah [see:95,116,190,29].** See:Chapter 2,schedule 1 *** See:Chapter 4,schedule 2,3 **** See:Chapter 2,Appendix 2 F O R E W O R D THE RELOCATION OF ARMENIANS TO THE LANDS OF NORTH AZERBAIJAN IN THE 19TH CENTURY IS AN HISTORICAL TRUTH A bloody period in the history of the South Caucasus began in the early 19th century.The Russian Empire,intending to occupy the region,waged wars against the Azerbaijani khanates.Soon the South Caucasus turned into a bloody battlefield of the war of the Russian Empire against the Gajars of Iran and the Ottoman Empire.The main part of the invasion plan of the Russian Empire was to occupy the Iravan Khanate bordering on the Ottoman Empire and the Gajars of Iran.Between 1804 and 1813,during the First Russian-Iranian war,there were two major assaults on the Iravan Khanate ( July 2 – October 3,1804; October 3 – November 30,1808 )by Russian troops in order to invade Azerbaijani lands.But the Iravan Khanate did not surrender to Russia and preserved its independence.The population of the Khanate defended its motherland bravely against the tsarist troops under the leadership of the wise and brave statesmen Mahammad Hüssein khan Gajar (1784-1805)and Hüsseingulu khan Gajar (1806-1827).The Russian troops suffered heavy losses and,in order to occupy the Iravan Khanate,high ranking officials of the Russian Empire made an enticing offer.The commander-in-chief of the Russian troops in the South Caucasus,General Goudovich,on behalf of the Emperor of Russia,said that if Hassan khan Gajar,the brother of the vicegerent of Iravan (Husseingulu khan-editor ),willingly surrendered the fortress,he would be set free and appointed the ruler of the whole Khanate,apart from the fortress and the city of Iravan.1 Hassan khan Gajar rejected this offer from the Emperor of Russia.Tsarist Russia also benefited from the assistance and betrayal of Armenians at state level in the occupation of Azerbaijani lands.For example,a special item was included in a decree of that time issued by the Tsar:“.You are authorized by all possible means necessary,to treat Armenians kindly for their support to us.”2 20 AZERBAIJAN NATIONAL ACADEMY OF

R D THE RELOCATION OF ARMENIANS TO THE LANDS OF NORTH AZERBAIJAN IN THE 19TH CENTURY IS AN HISTORICAL TRUTH Despite all of this,the Russian Empire could not occupy the Khanates of Iravan and Nakhchivan during the First Russian-Iranian war.The local,patriotic Azerbaijani population of both Khanates struggled bravely for the liberty of their motherland and defeated the invaders and Armenians who were supporting them.Nicolas I did not give up the Iravan Khanate as a loss.Taking into consideration the military and strategic importance of the occupation of the Iravan and Sardarabad fortresses,he often reminded General Yermolov of this point.On October 21,1826 the Russian Emperor wrote to Yermolov :“If it is possible to occupy Iravan,whether by the help of guns,bribing the vicegerent of Iravan ,or by making confidential friend-ly terms with him,don’t miss an opportunity”1 During the Second Russian-Iranian war ( 1826-1828 )Tsar Nicolas I (1825-1855)gave special priority to the occupation of the Iravan Khanate and in his decree issued on the 1st August,1826,he gave a special task to the invading General Yermolov:“Attack the Vicegerent of Iravan urgently.Waiting for this prompt response from you:Thank God there is no vicegerent anymore and the Iravan Khanate is completely invaded.You and 15 thousand Russian troops are enough to gain victory.”2 Azerbaijani patriots,led by the vicegerent of Iravan,Husseingulu khan Gajar,his brother Hassan khan Gajar,who had the title of “ King of Lions” and his grandson Fatali khan Gajar defended Iravan (27 April – 23 June; 24 September – 1 October )and Sardarabad fortresses hero-ically from the Russian invaders (16-17 April; 14-20 September )four times in 1827.Rejecting the offer of the Tsarist General Benkendorf to surrender the Sardarabad Fortress,Hassan khan’s grandson Fatali khan Gajar responded sharply and straightforwardly:“Better die under the ruins of the fortress than to surrender it “.3 21 AZERBAIJAN

RELOCATION OF ARMENIANS TO THE LANDS OF NORTH AZERBAIJAN IN THE 19TH CENTURY IS AN HISTORICAL TRUTH Heroic protector of the Iravan Fortress,Hassan khan,had placed a burning fuse in the gunpowder tower in order to blow up the fortress at the last moment.However,an act of betrayal worked.The Armenians contacted Paskevich,who had encircled the fortress,and told him where the Azerbaijani troops were located,in which direction they should fire their canons.1 Benefiting from the Armenians’ betrayal,Paskevich,the command er-in-chief of the Russian troops,seized the Iravan Fortress and invaded the khanate.For this “ victory “ he was awarded the title of Count2,second degree of the “Cross of Saint George “,a money award to the amount of one million roubles and the title of “ Erivanski”.3 The seizure of the Iravan Fortress was celebrated in Saint Petersburg with a special official parade and special medals were struck.[see:chapter 8,picture:5,6 ].V.Potto chronicled in detail what witness had told him about the ruin and damage to the city caused by the invading Russian troops :“When I reached the south-east corner of the fortress,I was shocked by the ruins of the walls and the towers.It seemed to me that what had been done by the Russian artillery in four days to the encircled fortress,could not have been done by God in four centuries.”4 Russian colonialists,with plans for the future occupation of the Gajars of Iran and the Ottoman Empire and plans to occupy the South Caucasus,with the aim of establishing a Christian stronghold in this region,began the mass relocation of Armenians.They were able to do this under the clauses of the Turkmanchay (1828),and Adirna (1829)treaties.Armenians were relocated from Iran and the Ottoman Empire to the lands of North Azerbaijan,in particular,the territories of Iravan,Nakhchivan* and the Garabagh Khanates and to Azerbaijani populated regions of the present Republic of Georgia.22 AZERBAIJAN NATIONAL ACADEMY OF

Khanates,gave exact instructions for the distribution of the relocated Armenians in the lands of Azerbaijan:the relocated Armenians should be directed to the regions of Iravan and Nakhchivan in order to increase the Christian population as much as possible.So from 26 February until 11 June 1828,for three and a half months,8249 Armenian families were relocated from Iran to the territories of the Khanates of Iravan,Nakhchivan and Garabagh.In other words,at least 40 thousand Armenians were relocated.1 A little bit later more than 90 thousand Armenians were relocated from the Ottoman Empire to the lands of North Azerbaijan.2 The relocation of Armenians from Iran and the Ottoman Empire to Northern Azerbaijani territories is an historical and irrefutable fact.This is comfirmed by archived materials,especially the official documents regulating this process.3 Armenians were relocated to Northern Azerbaijani territories with a purposeful aim,that is with the intention of creating an eternal mother land for them.The Armenian officers serving in the Russian army actively participated in this process.The Armenian generals were not afraid of declaring their intention openly.Colonel Gazaros Lazaryev (Lazaryan),from an Armenian background,who led this policy addressed the Armenians relocating from the territories of Iran to Northern Azerbaijani lands :”.There ( that is,in North Azerbaijan-editor)you will have a new native land inhabited by Christians.You will see that the Christians (that is,Armenians-editor)who were scattered over the different regions of Iran will live there as a community.Hurry up!

This date marks the creation of an Armenian state for the first time in history in Northern Azerbaijani territory and in general in the South Caucasus.It is an historical fact known to everyone that there never existed an Armenian state in the territory of the South Caucasus until then.26 AZERBAIJAN NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES,A.A.BAKIKHANOV INSTITUTE OF HISTORY F O R E W O R D THE RELOCATION OF ARMENIANS TO THE LANDS OF NORTH AZERBAIJAN IN THE 19TH CENTURY IS AN HISTORICAL TRUTH Immediately after the creation of the Armenian Province in the occupied territories of the Iravan and Nakhchivan Khanates-a ruthless and severe falsification of the history of Azerbaijan began.Armenian nationalists,with close participation and protection from the Russian invaders,began to create a false history of the Armenians.All archive documents,even the names and contents of the treaties of Russian Empire with the khanates of Azerbaijan,Iran and the Ottoman Empire,have been forged.Armenians holding high positions in leadership structures and state and government bodies of Russia and the Soviet Union,easily achieved their goals.Consequently,since the 1820s and 1830s,the Armenians relocated in the South Caucasus by Russia,have been presented as the “ancient inhabitants “ of the region.However,the Azerbaijanis,whose native,ancestoral lands had been captured and distributed among the Armenians were called “foreigners” and “ normad plunderers “.Armenian nationalists have continously and purposefully spread false information all over the world about Azerbaijan and Azerbaijanis.* Let’s consult the facts.The historical truth is that the Kurakchay Treaty was signed in 1805 between Russia and the Garabagh Khanate of Azerbaijan.The name of the treaty was :“Treaty between the Khan of Garabagh and the Russian Empire on the fall of the Khanate under the authority of Russia from 14 May,1805.”1 Under that treaty,the Garabagh Khanate accepted the patronage of Russia,and Russia in its turn confirmed that the lands of the Garabagh Khanate belonged to Ibrahimkhalil khan,more precisely,to Azerbaijan,and in the future would belong to his heirs.2 But Armenian historians,distorting both history and the Kürakchay Treaty,claimed that the territory of the Garabagh Khanate belonged to Armenians and that Kürakchay Treaty had been signed between Russia and Armenians.Whereas the relocation of Armenians from Iran and the Ottoman Empire to Azerbaijan,including the territory of the Garabagh 27 AZERBAIJAN NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES,A.A.BAKIKHANOV INSTITUTE OF HISTORY 1.АКАК t.2.,document

of 1805,but much later,in 1828.Garabagh Armenians in 1978 celebrated the 150th anniversary of their settlement in Garabagh and erected a monument on this occasion in the village of Margushavan of the Aghdere region.In 1988,Armenian separatist-terrorist bands dest ro yed this monument to “cover the traces of historical truth“.This monument also confirmed that Armenians are a relocated ethnicity in Garabagh.The reconstructed monument is now in the occupied territory of the Aghdere region of the Republic of Azerbaijan.28 AZERBAIJAN NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES,A.A.BAKIKHANOV INSTITUTE OF HISTORY

the beginning of the 19th century when the Russian Empire began to invade the South Caucasus,an Armenian state did not exist there.Azerbaijani khanates ruled nearly the whole South Caucasus.Besides the Azerbaijani khanates in the region,there was a Georgian Tsardom.Now the present Republic of Armenia is situated on the territory of the former Azerbaijani state of that time :the Khanate of Iravan.After the completion of the wars of 1828 between Russia and Iran,the two khanates of Azerbaijan – the Khanate of Iravan and the Khanate of Nakhchivan were annexed to the Russian Empire by the Türkmanchay Treaty (1828).This fact is confirmed in all the texts of the Türkmanchay treaty of 1828.1 The annexation of the Khanates of Iravan and Nakhchivan to the Russian Empire is shown in item III of the treaty:The word “Armenia“ is not found in this or other items of the treaty and could not be found.Because there did not exist a territory or a state named “Armenia“ in the South Caucasus.Armenian “historians“ having distorted all these historical facts,including the 29 AZERBAIJAN NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES,A.A.BAKIKHANOV INSTITUTE OF HISTORY

Khanates,presenting it as the so called “Unification of Armenia with Russia”.This is nothing but a forgery with deliberate intent,done purposefully.One more fact :Armenian scholars forge the science of history at academic level.For example,the Armenian historian and academician,S.P.Aghayan,in his book dedicated to the great Azerbaijani thinker A.A.Bakikhanov includes a map of the Azerbaijani khanates of 18th century.1 But the Armenian academician has distorted the map and he has not included one of the North Azerbaijani khanates – the Khanate of Iravan.30 AZERBAIJAN NATIONAL ACADEMY OF

of the Khanate of Iravan.Evidently,on the one hand,the Armenian academician in ”serving his people“,has distorted the historical truth and,on the other hand,he has not refrained from falsifying the Russian scholar P.I.Kovalevski’s book.“The Iravan Khanate:The Russian occupation and the relocation of Armenians to the lands of North Azerbaijan ” is a book prepared by a team of authors of the Institute of History of the National Academy of Sciences of Azerbaijan.The book is written to expose all these falsifications and to make the world comminity be aware of the scientific,more

after the occupation of this khanate by Russian troops,did the relocation of Armenians from Iran and the Ottoman Empire to North Azerbaijani lands begin.The territory in which the present Republic of Armenia is situated was Azerbaijani territory 180 years ago.The original population of this territory were Azerbaijanis.Armenians are not local inhabitants but strangers or aliens,more precisely,they

R E W O R D THE RELOCATION OF ARMENIANS TO THE LANDS OF NORTH AZERBAIJAN IN THE 19TH CENTURY IS AN HISTORICAL TRUTH The Iravan Khanate is an integral part of the history of Azerbaijani statehood 1 Following the collapse of the Afshar* Empire,which wasfounded by the great Azerbaijani warlord Nadir Shah,the Iravan** Khanate*** was one of the local states –Azerbaijani khanates-established in historical Azerbaijani lands.The Iravan Khanate was established in the western part of North Azerbaijan,on the territory of Chukhursad beylerbeyi (province),which was an administrative-territorial unit of the former Safavid Empire.All scientific theories concerning the name of the Chukhursad**** province,which surrounded the territory of the Iravan Khanate,con-firm its derivation from the names of ancient Azerbaijani Turkic tribes.It is an undisputable historical fact that an Azerbaijani tribe – either the Saadli or the Saadlis,was a part of the Garagoyunlu tribal union.A contemporary source mentioned that Emir Saad was the ruler of Chukhursad province during the time of Emir Timur’s con-quests [91,17-18].A researcher,G.Bournoutian of Armenian origin,also confirms the fact that the ethnic-name “Saadli” derives from the name of Emir Saad,who was the ruler of the Garagoyunlu tribal union in the XIV century [200,2].The Regent of the Saadli,Emir Saad died in 1411 and was buried in the vicinity of Iravan [164,139].After his death,his son Pirhüssein took over the leadership of the Saadli province [164,139].The Iravan 37 T H E I R A В А Н K H A N A T E THE RUSSIAN OCCUPATION AND THE RELOCATION OF ARMENIANS TO THE LANDS OF NORTH AZERBAIJAN AZERBAIJAN NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES,A.A.BAKIKHANOV INSTITUTE OF HISTORY * The Afshars are one of the ancient Turkish tribes that participated in the progress of the Azerbaijani people.At present,descendants of the Afshars live in the territories of Azerbaijan,Turkey and Iran.Nadir Shah belonged to the Qirkhli branch of the Afshars [see:196,24,191].** Armenian authors,in trying to claim a share in the history of the ancient Urartu,make the baseless assumption that the toponym “Iravan” has its roots in the name of the “Yerebuni Fortress” mentioned in Urartu sources.XIX century Russian author I.Zelinsky notes that the toponym “Iravan” is used by Armenians in the meaning of “yerevum” – “visible”,which is related to the false Armenian “Legend of Noah”,and by Tatars (Azerbaijani Turks – editor)in the meaning of “techet” – “flowing”,“smooth” [82,1].Yet,these suggestions do not have any scientific basis.The toponym “Ir” has no interpretation in the Armenian language.Ir (“Yer” – earth – trans.)is an ancient Turkish word meaning the “side of earth facing the Sun” [7,218].According to some researchers,the toponym “Iravan” consists of the word Ir,in Turkish languages meaning the “Sun-pointed side of mountains” and ‘wavy mountain peak”,and the Persian word “van”,meaning “earth / ground” [see:110,270].The theory suggesting that the toponym Iravan belongs to ethnic-names derived from ancient Turkish theonyms (divine names)and that it is identical with the Ir (“Yer”),which is the ancient Turkish God of Earth,is more legitimate [see:111,28].*** After Nadir Shah’s assassination on the night of June 19,1747,over 20 small states,called khanates and sultanates,were established on historically Azerbaijani territories.At that time,the Darband,Guba,Baku,Shamakhi,Javad,Salyan,Lankaran,Shaki,Ganja and Garabagh Khanates were created in the north of Azerbaijan; Nakhchivan and Iravan Khanates – in the west of Azerbaijan; and Ardabil,Sarab,Zanjan,Tabriz,Garadagh,Urmiya,Khoy,Maragha and Maku Khanates-in the south of Azerbaijan.**** According to some sources,the name of the Chukhursad province was related to the names of the Sak tribes of Turkish origin which inhabited the area as far back as in the VII century B.C.,meaning firstly ‘Saka Yurdu”-Land of Saka,“Saka Chukhuru”-the Valley of Saka and,later,in the Middle Ages – “Chukhursad Ölkesi”-the Land of Chukhursad [see:190,19].(Ravan)Fortress remained the capital of the emirate throughout Pirhüssein’s rule [164,139-140].Azerbaijani-Turkic tribes united under the rule of Emir Saad were called the Saadli from the late 14th century.From that time on the lands of North-West Azerbaijan in the Sürmali Valley on the Araz coastline (Yerashadzor* village and its surroundings in the territories of the current Republic of Armenia)began to be called Chukhursad ( )[161,140].Armenian sources also confirm the fact that Chukhursad is historically Azerbaijani land.Armenian sources call this area “Sahata pos” – Sahad’s valley or “Yerkrin Sahat” – Sahad’s country [214,26; 161,140].The first reference to the toponym Chukhursad in official documents is encountered in an Arabic document from 1428 describing its proprietorship over the village of Üchkilsa (Valarshabad)[164,140].Sürmali,which stretched from the junction of the Arpachay and Araz Rivers in Nakhchivan,to the right bank of the Araz in Aghridagh (Ararat),was an ancient land of the Saadli tribe.In the XV century,the areas on the bank of Araz River and the valley between the Aghridagh and Alagöz mountains,was also a part of the Saadli region.While describing the conquests of Sultan Shahrukh in Azerbaijan,Timur’s historian,Hafiz Ebru,points out that Nakhchivan and Sürmali were ancient lands of the Saadli region [18,562; 195,22].People used to call the valley “Chukhur”,which means “hollow place” or “valley”,as it looked like a big canyon.Azerbaijanis living in the plains of the Iravan province continued to call the valley “Sahad’s Valley” as history progressed,even into the 18th and19th centuries [44,11-12].In 1410,when the Azerbaijani Garagoyunlu dynasty gained power in Tabriz,the Saadli dynasty ruled the Iravan region.Material works of art found in the area also confirm this [see,end of chapter,pic.1,2,3,4].Having taken over the Garagoyunlu throne in 1420,Iskander dismissed the descendants of Emir Pirhüssein as the latter 38 T H E I R A В А Н K H A N A T E THE RUSSIAN OCCUPATION AND THE RELOCATION OF ARMENIANS TO THE LANDS OF NORTH AZERBAIJAN AZERBAIJAN NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES,A.A.BAKIKHANOV INSTITUTE OF HISTORY * The name of Yerashadzor (Երասխատչոր)village was translated from Azerbaijani into Armenian and means “valley on the bank of Araz”.supported his brother and rival for throne Abu Saed,and brought the Chukhursad province under the direct control of his central government [164,142].In this period,the Chukhursad province bordered Georgia to the north (the Kartli Tsardom after Georgia was separated in 1469),the Garabagh province to the east,Samskhe-Saatabago*,Pasin,Alashqird and Bayazid in the west and Nakhchivan,Gapan and Maku to the south.The borders of the Chukhursad province changed many times due to historical events.During the rule of the Garagoyunlu dynasty,an event took place in the history of the Chukhursad province which would later cause grave problems for Azerbaijan.In 1441,by permission of the Garagoyunlu ruler Jahanshah,the centre of activities of the Armenian Catholic Church was moved from the city of Sis in the Cilicia province to Azerbaijan – to the Üchkilse (Üchmüadzin**)monastery near Iravan [51,87; 138,255].This created favourable conditions for Armenian missionaries spreading the Gregorian faith in the South Caucasus.The Garagoyunlu rulers protected the Heads of the Armenian Catholic Church and granted them freedom of action.As,a result,Üchkilse,located in the Chukhursad province of Azerbaijan,became the religious centre for all Armenians.The position of the Üchkilse Catholicos(Head of the Armenian Catholic Church)strengthened even more during the Aghgoyunlu dynasty,which followed the Garagoyunlu dynasty.Thus,Armenian churches were built on the territory of Azerbaijan – in the Chukhursad province-by permission of the Garagoyunlu and Aghgoyunlu rulers.39 T H E I R A В А Н K H A N A T E THE RUSSIAN OCCUPATION AND THE RELOCATION OF ARMENIANS TO THE LANDS OF NORTH AZERBAIJAN AZERBAIJAN NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES,A.A.BAKIKHANOV INSTITUTE OF HISTORY *The name of the Samskhe-Saatabago district was translated from Azerbaijani into Georgian and means Üchgala-Atabey Yurdu ( Three Fortresses –Land of Atabey-trans)**As the name of this temple (later church),which is called “Echmiadzin” by Armenians after falsification of the name,has no meaning in the Armenian language,Armenian authors resort to long explanations [see:51,374].Üchkilse or Üchmüadzin was an ancient Azerbaijani-Albanian monastery.It consists of the word “üch”,which means the number “three” in Azerbaijani Turkish and “müadzin”,which means “preacher” in Arabic.The temple’s name is also written as Üchkilsa in trade documents from the Middle Ages that are kept in Matenadaran [see:72,73].A centralized Azerbaijan Safavid state was established in the early XVI century with its capital in the city of Tabriz.Chukhursad became a part of the Safavid state,just like all the other regions of Azerbaijan [see,end of chapter,pic.6,7,8 and 9].In the 1530s,the territory of the Azerbaijani Safavid state was divided into 13 administrative provinces – beylerebeyis.One of these was the Chukhursad beylerbeyi with its centre still at the Iravan (Ravan)Fortress.The Chukhursad beylerbeyi covered the Maku,Sadarak and Nakhchivan (from the early XVII century)provinces,Zaruzbila,Bayazid Fortress,lands belonging to the Shadili tribe,inhabited by the Dumbulu Kurds* who were moved to these areas during the Ottoman conquests,and Maghazberd [174,14].The Chukhursad beylerbeyi was governed by the representatives of two Azerbaijani tribes – the Ustajli and Rumlu-appointed by the Safavid shahs.The Chukhursad beylerbeyi was always ruled by renowned Azerbaijani Turkic military leaders,due to the fact that it bordered on the Ottoman Empire.That is,the first beylerbeyi of the Chukhursad was Badir khan Ustajli,as mentioned in “Ahsan-üt-Tavarikh” by Hassan bey Rumlu in 1538.He was later replaced by Shahgulu Sultan Ustajli.In 1554,during an attack by Sultan Süleiman Ganuni on Iravan,Hüssein khan Rumlu was the Chukhursad beylerbeyi.After the attack,Shahgulu Sultan Ustajli was appointed to the position.Later,the position was held by Mahammad khan Tokhmag Ustajli and others [174,121-122; 170,52-53].The early XVI century marked the beginning of the most troubled period in the history of the Chukhursad beylerbeyi,located on the Safavid-Ottoman border.The territory of beylerbeyi and its centre,the Iravan Fortress turned into a battlefield between two fraternal Turkic empires – the Safavids and Ottomans,who were engaged in bloody wars against each other and it was repeatedly passed from the dominion of one to the other.In accordance with the Istanbul Peace Treaty of 1590,the Chukhursad beylerbeyi was subjected to Ottoman rule.A contemporary source,“Müfassal Defter” (Notebook of 40 T H E I R A В А Н K H A N A T E THE RUSSIAN OCCUPATION AND THE RELOCATION OF ARMENIANS TO THE LANDS OF NORTH AZERBAIJAN AZERBAIJAN NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES,A.A.BAKIKHANOV INSTITUTE OF HISTORY *The Kürdish tribes which inhabited the territories of the Chukhursad beylerbeyi had been moved to these lands by Ottoman sultans from the banks of the Diyarbekr and Tigris rivers in the late XVI century.As the Kürds were sunnis,the Ottoman sultans placed them in the lands of Azerbaijani Turks – qizilbashs,who were Shiites,and were forced to move from these lands during the Safavid – Ottoman wars.“ Sunni Dajla kürds called “Kurmanj”,relocated from Diyarbekr and other places… to Maku,Iravan and Nakhchivan areas and settled in the villages and towns,from which Qizilbash-Turkmen and Oyrat people were deported.” [ see:17; 192,437-438].Details-trans.),i.e.In-Depth Book,from 1590,describes the beylerbeyi’s administrative structure as follows:the territory of the Chukhursad beylerbeyi was divided into two livas (regions),the Iravan and Nakhchivan Livas.The Iravan Liva included 10 nahiyyes (subregions):Iravan,Garbi,Garni,Vedi,Aralig,Talin,Armus,Abnik,Abaran and Sharabkhana.The Nakhchivan Liva was comprised of 16 nahiyyas:Aghjagala,Mavaziyi-Khatun,Mülki-Arslanli,Garabagh,Darasham,Darashahbuz,Bazarchayi,Sharur,Zar,Zabil,Alinja,Sisyan,Azadjiran and Ordubad,and 1 sanjag (dis trict)– the Nakhchivan sanjag [6; 8-9].The Safavid-Ottoman wars lasted for over 100 years and ended in 1639,with the Gasri-Shirin Treaty.As a result,there was a long period of peace between the two empires that lasted until 1723.The peace and quiet that followed affected positively socio-economic development in Chukhursad.The Chukhursad beylerbeyi was still governed by leaders appointed by the Safavid rulers.Shah Abbas I (1587-1629),who had freed the area from the Ottomans,appointed Amirgüne khan Gajar*,who had earned the nickname “Yellow Lion” for the valour he demonstrated during battles against Ottomans,the beylerbeyi of Chukhursad (Iravan).After the death of Amirgüne khan in 1625,his son Tahmasibgulu bey Gajar,Shah Abbas I’s most famous military leader,was appointed to the position [105,155-156; 174,125].Throughout the entire XVII century,the region continued to be governed by an ancient Azerbaijani tribe,the Aghjagoyunlu Gajars.In 1663,Shah Abbas II (1642-1666)appointed Abbasgulu khan,the son of the former Chukhursad ruler Amirgüne khan,to the position of governor of Iravan.Abbasgulu khan governed the Chukhursad beylerbeyi until the early 1670s.He was followed by Safi khan of Georgian origin,who had converted to Islam.After the death of Safi khan,Safigulu khan Alkhas Mirza oghlu and Safigulu khan Rustam became the beylerbeyis of Chukhursad [see:104,100-101; 105,156; 164,111; see,end of chapter,Annex 1].During the reign of these last two beylerbeyis,the population’s conditions have been deteriorated.Eventually,military servicemen of the Gajar and Bayat tribes,who had not been paid for two years,launched a revolt against 41 T H E I R A В А Н K H A N A T E THE RUSSIAN OCCUPATION AND THE RELOCATION OF ARMENIANS TO THE LANDS OF NORTH AZERBAIJAN AZERBAIJAN NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES,A.A.BAKIKHANOV INSTITUTE OF HISTORY * Amirgüna khan belonged to the ancient Azerbaijani tribe of Aghjagoyunlu Gajar [see:174,125; 196,186-187].Safigulu khan in 1677 [181,195-196].As a result,Shah Safi II (Süleiman)(1666-1694)appointed Zal khan,who was among his most trusted people,to the Chukhursad beylerbeyi.During his reign – the last quarter of the XVII century,the Safavid state underwent a severe decline,just like all Near East countries.This did not leave the Chukhursad beylerbeyi unaffected.Nevertheless,normal economic life continued in Chukhursad,as well as in many other parts of Azerbaijan.The province’s central city of Iravan was located at the junction of trade roads connecting the trading centres of the Ottoman Empire with the cities of Tiflis,Ganja,Shamakhi and Isfahan [187,28].Iravan maintained extensive trade relations with the other Azerbaijani cities.“Merchants were arriving in Iravan from everywhere and purchasing all kinds of goods…” [187,28].The Safavid-Ottoman wars led to significant changes to the historical borders of Chukhursad.The Chukhursad beylerbeyi lost approximately half of its territories as a result of the 1635-1639 Safavid-Ottoman wars.The beylerbeyi managed to keep only Iravan and East Shöreyel out of all the territories belonging to it in the XIV-XVI centuries.Territorial changes also occurred in the Chukhursad area following the death of Shah Abbas I.That is,Shah Safi I made amendments to the borders of several provinces in 1629-1634.He annexed Maku and Nakhchivan to Chukhursad and removed Pambak and Borchali,which were eventually annexed to the Garabagh beylerbeyi [182,53].According to E.Chelebi,Maku was a separate sultanate inside the Iravan (Chukhursad)beylerbeyi [96,107].During the period from the 1630s to the 1720s,the Chukhursad beylerbeyi contained the provinces of Iravan,Eastern Shöreyel,Nakhchivan and Maku*.From the XVI century to the first quarter of the XVIII century,the Iravan province had stable borders.The province’s territories were located on both sides of the Araz River (the largest part being on the left bank).42 T H E I R A В А Н K H A N A T E THE RUSSIAN OCCUPATION AND THE RELOCATION OF ARMENIANS TO THE LANDS OF NORTH AZERBAIJAN AZERBAIJAN NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES,A.A.BAKIKHANOV INSTITUTE OF HISTORY *Some sources state that Maku province was still a part of the Iravan Khanate at the time the latter was occupied [see:59,49-50].In the early XVIII century,the central government of the Safavid state was weakened.Governors in charge of various Azerbaijani provinces,as well as the Chukursad beylerbeyis,were separated from central government and became independent rulers.Local governors were using national rebellion in order to achieve their goals.In this period,the strongest rebellion in North Azerbaijan took place in the Shirvan beylerbeyi.The rebels took control of Shamakhi city in August 1721,under the leadership of Haji Davud,and killed the Shirvan beylerbeyi.Thus,the first independent state – khanate-in North Azerbaijan was established [136,28-36].Being in panic and not getting an assistance from the centre,the combined troops of the Chukhursad beylerbeyi,Mehrali khan,and the Garabagh beylerbeyi,Ughurlu khan,moved towards Shamakhi.They met near Barda – on the bank of the Kur river and gathered a force of 30 thousand warriors,but the Shah did not manage to help them.Haji Davud,who was informed of this,united with his allies from Daghistan and did not let them cross the Kur.He attacked suddenly and defeated the combined troops of the beylerbeyis [52,28-29].Benefiting from the weakened Safavid state,Afghans seized the capital city of Isfahan in 1722.Armenian religious figures used these favourable conditions to contact Peter I and induce him to conquer Azerbaijani lands,including Iravan [126,86-93].In December 1722,the head of the Armenian eparchy in Tiflis,Archbishop Minas Parvazyan,wrote to vardapet Minas:“You are aware that Iravan is the key to the Iranian (Safavid-editor)lands and our goal is to get hold of the Iravan Fortress.If we gain the fortress,neither the Turks nor the Iranians will be able to touch us” [35,XXXI; 126,93].Russia occupied the Caspian shoreline provinces of the Safavid state in 1722-1723 [169,38-64].The worried Ottoman Empire brought its troops into Azerbaijan in 1723 in order to prevent a march from Russia.43 T H E I R A В А Н K H A N A T E THE RUSSIAN OCCUPATION AND THE RELOCATION OF ARMENIANS TO THE LANDS OF NORTH AZERBAIJAN AZERBAIJAN NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES,A.A.BAKIKHANOV INSTITUTE OF HISTORY Russia drew back from involvement in war with the Ottomans.Eventually,a peace treaty was signed between the Russian and Ottoman states in 1724 in Istanbul.According to the treaty,Russia was satisfied with the Caspian shoreline territories it had occupied.The Ottomans in return granted Russian neutrality in their plans to occupy the remaining territories of the South Caucasus,including Azerbaijan.Following the Istanbul Treaty,the Ottoman Empire attacked and conquered all Azerbaijani territories as far as Ardabil.Encirclement and heroic defence of the Iravan Fortress (July 6 – October 7,1724)The Ottomans faced stout resistance during their occupation of Iravan province.The most precise record of the Ottoman occupation of Iravan is provided in a book by Kamani Mustafa Agha,a participant in the events,titled “The Occupation of Ravan” [22].In the spring of 1724,the Ottoman warlord Arifi Ahmad Pasha set off from Tiflis towards Iravan with over 60 thousand soldiers and,on May 29,he reached the Arpachay valley and set up position there [22,33-34].The “Anonymous Armenian Chronicle”,which is considered another source of the time,mentions that Abdulla Pasha Köprülu* headed the 75,000-strong Ottoman force that attacked Iravan [38,8].The Ottoman army faced stern resistance at the Iravan Fortress.The entire Chukursad population,headed by their beylerbeyi Aligulu khan,** rose to protect the motherland and put up unyielding resistance to the Ottoman troops***.The city’s population consisted wholly of Azerbaijanis during the defence of Iravan.The fact that the central Ottoman government had to provide frequent military assistance to the Ottoman army**** surrounding 44 T H E I R A В А Н K H A N A T E THE RUSSIAN OCCUPATION AND THE RELOCATION OF ARMENIANS TO THE LANDS OF NORTH AZERBAIJAN AZERBAIJAN NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES,A.A.BAKIKHANOV INSTITUTE OF HISTORY * The records of Kamani Mustafa Agha,who was a direct participant in the events,are more trustwor-thy,as Abdulla Pasha Köprulu led the attack on Tabriz,not Iravan.** A contemporary source indicates that Aligulu khan was the beylerbeyi of Chukhursad when Ottoman troops encircled the Iravan Fortress [see:22,50,61 etc.].*** There are interesting materials stating that defenders of Iravan even split into 2 parts,left the fortress and attacked the Ottomans [see:22,56].**** In reply to a request by Arif Ahmad Pasha,who had surrounded the Iravan Fortress,the Ottoman sultan first sent troops of 35 thousand [38,11],then a troop of 10 thousand men under the command of Kütahya pasha [38,12; 204,261] and finally,a military force of 3 thousand men enlisted from Egypt [38,13].the Iravan Fortress is vivid proof of the fortress’ heroic defence.L.Lockhart’s records mention that Iravan’s defenders resisted heroically,the Ottomans suffered huge losses and “Arif Ahmad Pasha offered a temporary ceasefire in order to bury the dead” [204,261].The Armenians inhabiting Üchkilse and its vicinities,and comprised mostly of Gregorian missionaries,were not interested in the fate of Chukhursad or the Iravan Fortress,because it was not their motherland.On the contrary,in order to strengthen their position in these lands,they were ready to reach agreement with any foreign power willing to attack the country*.Therefore,neither the Catholicos nor the Armenian missionaries participated in the defence of Iravan.On the contrary,the Armenians built relationships with the Ottoman military forces and were looking forward to the victory of the Ottoman troops and the surrender of the Iravan Fortress**.Undoubtedly,it was because of this “merit” that Sultan Ahmad III issued a special decree concerning the Armenians.The decree sent by Sultan Ahmad III to Arif Ahmad Pasha a week after the encirclement of the Iravan Fortress states that “attacks on Üchkilse,the religious centre of the Armenians,are forbidden,it should not be destroyed and the population should not be plundered” [38,11].Arif Ahmad Pasha even designated a regiment to protect Üchkilse in accordance with the Sultan’s decree [38,11].The fact that Sultan Ahmad III permitted the massacre of Azerbaijani Turks protecting the Iravan Fortress during its encirclement and issued special decrees not to touch Armenians,proves that the slanderous propaganda of modern Armenian nationalists claiming that Turks have committed genocide against Armenians since the Middle Ages has no basis.On the contrary,this fact proves that Turks have always protected Armenians.45 T H E I R A В А Н K H A N A T E THE RUSSIAN OCCUPATION AND THE RELOCATION OF ARMENIANS TO THE LANDS OF NORTH AZERBAIJAN AZERBAIJAN NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES,A.A.BAKIKHANOV INSTITUTE OF HISTORY * The Catholicos of Üchkilsa not only provided wrong information to the Ottoman pasha about Shah Tahmasib of the Safavids,but also called upon the defenders of Iravan Fortress to surrender [22,54-55].**”The Anonymous Armenian Chronicle” not only has serious historical errors,but it also claims that Armenians also took part in the defence of Iravan Fortress.Other sources do not confirm this claim.On the contrary,had Armenians resisted the Ottoman troops and helped the Iravan beyler-beyi,they would not have been rewarded by the Ottoman sultan right after the surrender of Iravan Fortress [see:22,56; 38,17].The defenders of the Iravan Fortress heroically withstood desper-ate attacks under persistent gunfire.The encirclement lingered on.The Ottomans failed to take the Iravan Fortress.Realizing that he would not be able to break the resistance of the fortress’ defenders,the Ottoman commander sent the following letter to Sultan Ahmad III asking for additional support:“This city has a huge number of troops; we have already lost many soldiers.What are your orders? Will you send help,or should we turn back?” [38,11].In reply,the Sultan sent additional military forces to help the Ottoman troops keep the Iravan Fortress surrounded.However,the arrival of new forces under the command of the Pasha of Kütahya did not change the situation for the Ottomans.Yet,as the encirclement continued,the lack of food and supplies in the fortress grew worse.Since nobody came to help the city’s defenders,the Iravan command had to agree to open negotiations with Arif Ahmad Pasha [204,261].The Ottoman troops receiving consistent support from the centre,finally managed to seize the Iravan Fortress which they had kept surrounded for 92 days*,albeit with great difficulty** [22,69].Immediately after the seizure of the Iravan Fortress,the Ottoman Pasha received the Armenian’s religious leader,the Üchkilse Catholicos Astvasatur I of Hamadan,and rewarded him with gifts and presents for his “service” [38,17].Thus,abiding by their treacherous traditions,Armenians once again took the side of the aggressor and betrayed the Safavid state,which had offered them patronage for over 200 years.46 T H E I R A В А Н K H A N A T E THE RUSSIAN OCCUPATION AND THE RELOCATION OF ARMENIANS TO THE LANDS OF NORTH AZERBAIJAN AZERBAIJAN NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES,A.A.BAKIKHANOV INSTITUTE OF HISTORY * The author of the “Anonymous Armenian Chronicle” claims that the fortress remained under encir-clement for 60 days and that the Ottoman troops entered the Iravan fortress in June 7,1724 [38,17].Western historians write that the fortress’ encirclement continued from June 24 till September 28 [204,261].** The author of the “Occupation of Ravan ” writes that the encirclement of Iravan Fortress started on July 6,1724 (in Shavval 13 (tenth month of Islamic calendar – trans.)1136)and ended in October 7 of the same year (in Maharram 18 (first month of Islamic calendar – trans.)1137)[22,69].After the seizure of the Iravan Fortress,the governor-general of Anatolia,Osman Pasha,was appointed governor of Iravan [22,70].According to L.Lockhart,the conquering of Iravan was as costly to the Ottoman state as it was important to them.The Ottomans suffered the loss of over 20 thousand men,including those who died from disease,yet the defenders of the fortress bore higher losses [204,261].According to A.Ionisyan,during the encirclement of Iravan the Ottomans took losses of over 20 thousand men,apart from those who died from disease [34,XXXL].L.Lockhart mentions another interesting fact,that the surviving defenders of the Iravan fortress garrison were allowed to leave the city with honour following its surrender [204,261].After the loss of Iravan,the Chukhursad beylerbeyi remained under Ottoman rule for over 10 years.The Ottomans applied their administrative system in the occupied Azerbaijani territories and divided the provinces into sanjags and nahiyyas.According to the “Müfassal Defter”,i.e.In-Depth Book,of Iravan province dated 1728,together with Maku,Igdir and Sürmali nahiyyas,the Zar,Zabil and Sharur nahiyyas were also removed from the Nakhchivan sanjag and annexed to Iravan province.At the same time,Göycha,Mazraa,Khinzirak,Qirkhbulag,Darachichak and Sadarak nahiyyas,as well as the Shöreyel liva,were created on the territory of Iravan province.The Talin,Armus,Abnik and Sharabkhana nahiyyas,which existed in the late XVI century,as well as the Bazarchay and Aghjagala nahiyyas which existed within the Nakhchivan sanjag,were annulled [6,9].Thus,during the 1728 Ottoman census,the territorial-administrative structures of the Iravan province and Nakhchivan sanjag were as follows:Iravan province – Iravan city,Qirkhbulag,Garbi,Maku,Khinzirak,Garni,Vedi,Darachichak,Abaran,47 T H E I R A В А Н K H A N A T E THE RUSSIAN OCCUPATION AND THE RELOCATION OF ARMENIANS TO THE LANDS OF NORTH AZERBAIJAN AZERBAIJAN NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES,A.A.BAKIKHANOV INSTITUTE OF HISTORY Göycha,Mazraa,Sürmali,Igdir,Aralig,Sharur,Sadarak and Zarzamin nahiyyas and the Shöreyel liva; Nakhchivan sanjag – Nakhchivan city,Nakhchivan,Alinja,Sair Mavazi,Darashahbuz,Mülki-Arslan,Mavaziyi Khatun,Garabagh,Qishlaghat,Darasham,Azadjiran,Shorlut,Daranürgüt,Daralayaz and Sisyan nahiyyas [6,9].The decline of the Safavid state was closing in.Beginning from 1726,a renowned Azerbaijani warrior,Nadirgulu khan Safavi of the Afshar tribe,gradually took command of the regular troops in the Safavid state.The new military leader banished the Afghans who had captured Isfahan and freed the city in 1730.After that,he managed to drive the Russian troops out of the Caspian shoreline territories.In this way he created favourable conditions to fight freely in one last direction-against the Ottomans.Nadirgulu khan launched a military operation against the Ottoman Empire from the south of Azerbaijan.At the beginning of 1731,the cities of Maragha,Tabriz and Ardabil were freed.However,a rebellion rose in Khorasan against the central government while Nadirgulu khan was preparing an attack in the direction of Nakhchivan and Iravan.Thus he had to halt the successful military operations against the Ottoman troops and head towards Khorasan.The Safavid ruler Shah Tahmasib II used this situation to rise in the estimation of the nation,especially of the army,and launched an attack in the direction of Nakhchivan and Iravan; he himself led the Safavid army [219; 116; 115; 19].However,the Shah was defeated at the first battle with Ottoman troops and retreated.Another unfavourable and onerous peace treaty for the country was concluded with the Ottoman command.According to the conditions of the Kirmanshah Peace Treaty,signed between the Safavid state and the Ottoman Empire on January 16,1732,Iravan and Nakhchivan remained under the dominion of the Ottoman Empire,together with several southern regions of Azerbaijan.48 T H E I R A В А Н K H A N A T E THE RUSSIAN OCCUPATION AND THE RELOCATION OF ARMENIANS TO THE LANDS OF NORTH AZERBAIJAN AZERBAIJAN NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES,A.A.BAKIKHANOV INSTITUTE OF HISTORY Having returned in triumph from the Khorasan operation,Nadirgulu khan did not accept the terms of the new treaty.Confident of the army’s support,he dethroned Shah Tahmasib II the same year and declared the latter’s son,who was still in his cradle,as Shah,under the name of Shah Abbas II and undertook patronage of the new “Shah”.Thus,Nadirgulu khan became the sole ruler of the Safavid state [136,106].Immediately after gaining power,Nadirgulu khan demanded the retreat of Ottoman troops from all the Safavid territories they had occupied since 1723.Upon receipt of a negative response,Nadirgulu khan restored military operations against the Ottoman troops.Under the attacks of Safavid troops headed by this prominent military leader,Ottoman troops began to retreat from Azerbaijani territories.When they reached Iravan,the Ottoman garrison inside the fortress preferred defence to fighting.Yet,soon realizing the futility of this idea,the Ottoman garrison started negotiations with Nadirgulu khan.Eventually,the Ottomans in the Iravan Fortress left on October 3,1735,bearing no losses [203,89].Realizing Nadir’s inevitable success,the Armenian Catholicos this time turned his back on the Ottomans and supported Nadir.After Iravan,Nadirgulu khan freed Ganja of Ottoman troops on July 9,1735.In 1736,Nadirgulu khan formally dethroned the last representative of the Safavid dynasty,the 4-year-old Shah Abbas III,who had officially been considered Shah until then,and “had himself elected” at the Mughan congress of March the same year.By the way,the Armenian Catholicos participating in the gathering demonstrated a special zeal during the ceremony to “elect” Nadir as shah! 49 T H E I R A В А Н K H A N A T E THE RUSSIAN OCCUPATION AND THE RELOCATION OF ARMENIANS TO THE LANDS OF NORTH AZERBAIJAN AZERBAIJAN NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES,A.A.BAKIKHANOV INSTITUTE OF HISTORY Administrative government reform of the state ranked among the first of those carried out by Nadir shah.He cancelled the administrative-territorial divisions – Shirvan,Garabagh,Azerbaijan and Chukhursad beylerbeyis-that had existed until then in the historical Azerbaijani lands.Instead of the four beylerbeyis,a single province of Azerbaijan was established,with Tabriz as its capital city.Hence,Nadir shah united all Azerbaijani lands into a single administrative province.Nadir shah delegated government of the new province to his brother Ibrahim khan.As mentioned above,the Armenian Catholicos,who participated in the Mughan congress at which Nadir was “elected” Shah,and who backed his candidacy with great zeal,Abraham Kretasi,writes in his memoir that Nadir shah appointed his brother as the head and sardar,i.e.,military leader of Atrpatakan,which was called Azerbaijan,assigned to him the governance of Nakhchivan,Iravan,the entire province of Ararat (Chukhursad district – editor)and Georgia,and appointed him as the beylerbeyi of all the other khans and absolute sovereign [23,244].Interestingly,in his book Abraham Kretasi recorded his negotiations with Nadir shah Afshar mostly in the Azerbaijani language,using Armenian letters [23,198,199-120,214,215,220,244,250 etc.].This fact shows that not only the language spoken among the people,but also in official negotiations and ceremonies in the great Empire built by Nadir shah,was the Azerbaijani Turkic language.That Abraham Kretasi spoke in Azerbaijani is clear proof that this language was an important means of communication in the Empire.On the eve of the Mughan congress,Nadirgulu khan appointed his trusted man Pir Mahmud khan as the khan of Iravan and the beylerbeyi of this region [23,245].Even though the victories he gained in the wars against foreign aggressors raised Nadir shah in the estimation of the army and the entire country even higher,his planning of new wars and continuous 50 T H E I R A В А Н K H A N A T E THE RUSSIAN OCCUPATION AND THE RELOCATION OF ARMENIANS TO THE LANDS OF NORTH AZERBAIJAN AZERBAIJAN NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES,A.A.BAKIKHANOV INSTITUTE OF HISTORY rises in taxes for this purpose from the village and urban populations,brought national discontent to its highest level.National uprisings covered the entire country.Azerbaijan aspired to escape the control of a great empire and restore its traditions of statehood.The freedom movement was getting stronger.The ever deteriorating welfare of the people,lack of grain and starvation were growing worse [115,24-25,51].It was for this reason that Nadir shah failed to suppress the revolts brewing across the entire empire against his government and restore stability in the country.On the night of June 19,1747 he was assassinated by his own courtiers [203,261].The news of Nadir’s death brought even greater anarchy to the Empire territory.The Azerbaijani movement for freedom was further reinforced.Independent local states – khanates and sultanates-emerged in the territories of Azerbaijan,one after another.Following the assassination of Nadir shah,the population of Iravan revolted under the leadership of Mehdi khan.Mehdi khan declared himself an independent ruler [115,52].However,the newly-established Iravan Khanate’s territories did not cover all the lands of the former Chukhursad beylerbeyi.A part of its territories had been moved into Nakhchivan and other khanates during the previous administrative reforms.In the mid XVIII century,the Iravan Khanate was one of over 20 state units – khanates that had gained their independence after the freedom movements that had lasted for a long time in the territories of Azerbaijan.Mehdi khan Gassimli* (Afshar)[221,93],founder of the independent Iravan Khanate following the assassination of Nadir shah Afshar in 1747,pursued a policy of expanding his territories,51 T H E I R A В А Н K H A N A T E THE RUSSIAN OCCUPATION AND THE RELOCATION OF ARMENIANS TO THE LANDS OF NORTH AZERBAIJAN AZERBAIJAN NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES,A.A.BAKIKHANOV INSTITUTE OF HISTORY * A source in Persian relates Mehdi khan to the Gassimli branch of the Afshars and states that he was the ruler of Iravan even while Nadir shah was alive [see:221,93-94].just like the other Azerbaijani khans.For this purpose,he attacked the Urmiya Khanate in 1748.The head of the Urmiya Khanate,Fatali khan Afshar,lost the battle and had to concede certain parts of his territories to Mehdi khan [221,93-94; 112,111].Yet,his power was short-termed.Mahammad Hüssein khan Garayli replaced him in 1748 [221,94,97-98].Soon after this,another Azerbaijani khan trying to restore his authority,Fatali khan Afshar of Urmiya,entered into alliance with Azad khan from Afghanistan and their combined troops launched an attack on Iravan.In 1751 they captured the Iravan Fortress and defeated the troops of Irakli II,who had ostensibly come to help the Khan of Iravan.After Azad khan defeated Irakli II,official documents belonging to the Iravan Khanate mention the name of Khalil khan Özbak* as the representative of Azad khan [105,136,194] and state that he governed the Iravan Khanate from 1752 [82,5].Also,according to the late professor F.Aliyev,Khalil khan Özbak,the representative of Azad khan,was a governor of the Iravan Khanate for some time [115,55].However,another source from that time – “Gulustani-Iram “ by A.A.Bakikhanov – mentions the name of Hüsseinali khan,who was a representative of the local Gajar tribe,as the Khan of Iravan during the events of 1752** [39,156].Probably,the representative of Azad khan-Khalil khan Özbak only controlled the clerical affairs of the Iravan Khanate.52 T H E I R A В А Н K H A N A T E THE RUSSIAN OCCUPATION AND THE RELOCATION OF ARMENIANS TO THE LANDS OF NORTH AZERBAIJAN AZERBAIJAN NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES,A.A.BAKIKHANOV INSTITUTE OF HISTORY *Contemporary source “Jambr” shows that)the Catholicoses of 1750-1751,1752-1753,1754-1755 got document from Azad khan and his representative Khalil khan that their estates were maaf(estate given from khan as a gift,which is tax free-trans).** While it is very probable that A.A.Bakikhanov confused Hassanali khan Gajar with Hüsseinali khan Gajar,it is impossible that he confused Hüsseinali khan Gajar with Khalil khan Özbak.“Jambr” also mentions the name of Hassanali khan Gajar in official documents from 1755 [see:105,136].Yet,the original sources confirm that not long after this,in 1755,the Iravan Khanate was governed by Hassanali khan Gajar*-a representative of the local Gajar dynasty [105,136; 95,161; 82,5].Hassanali khan Gajar had been punished by the Khan (governor – editor)of Iravan as far back as during Nadir shah’s reign,when both his eyes were put out [105,231].Hassanali khan’s return to power proves that the ancient local tribe of Iravan – the Aghjagoyunlu** Gajars – had great authority with the population.As noted by I.Shopen,Hassanali khan Gajar’s coming to power marked the beginning of inherited government in the Iravan Khanate [95,161].After Hassanali khan,his brother Hüsseinali khan Gajar [105,137,232; 95,163; 82,5] came to power.Yet the first source mentions the name of Hüsseinali khan Gajar as Khan of Iravan since 1759-1760 [105,137].Hüsseinali khan Gajar died on November 9,1783 and his elder son,the 15-year-old Gulamali khan Gajar,took his place on the throne [95,164; 37,267; 150,40).However,Gulamali khan’s power was short-lived.In the summer of 1784 he was killed and Hüsseinali 53 T H E I R A В А Н K H A N A T E THE RUSSIAN OCCUPATION AND THE RELOCATION OF ARMENIANS TO THE LANDS OF NORTH AZERBAIJAN AZERBAIJAN NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES,A.A.BAKIKHANOV INSTITUTE OF HISTORY *Ancient Azerbaijani Turks – the Gajars – are by origin a strain of the Sham Bayati branch of the Bayat clan of the Oghuz tribe.The Gajar clan was created as a combination of this strain and the Yiva,Aghjali and Aghjagoyunlu branches.Some researchers relate Gajars to Aghajeris,which settled in Azerbaijan in 465 and which were also mentioned in Byzantine sources,were said to have been close to Khazars and Bulgars and belonged to the ruling class of the Hun tribe.Aghajeris were later called Gajars in Azerbaijan and settled in the Khalkhal region.According to Z.V.Togha,the Petersburg copy of Rashidaddin’s “Jami at-Tavarikh” contains a special record regarding the Aghajeris:“Today the name of Aghajeri has taken the form of Gajar in the lan-guages of Turks and others.When attacking the Alamut ismailis and Syrians,Hulaku khan had enlisted also the ancient inhabitants of Azerbaijan – the Gajars”.According to Mirza Bala,this is how the Gajars spread from Azerbaijan to Anatolia and Syria,as well as the Astrabad region located near Alamut [see:209,137-147].** Sources refer to the ancient Gajar tribes living in the Chukhursad province as the Gajars [196,186-187]; other researchers also confirm that Khans of Iravan were descended from the Gajar tribe [82,5; 39,185; 200,8].The ancient Azerbaijani tribe of Aghjagoyunlu Gajars has played an important role in the governing of the Chukhursad beylerbeyi since the early XVII century.The rulers of the independent Iravan Khanate,just like the other Azerbaijani khanates that emerged following the assassination of Nadir shah,were precisely representatives of Aghjagoyunlu Gajars [see:end of chapter,Annex 2].khan Gajar’s 12-year-old son,Mahammad Hüssein khan Gajar*,succeeded to the throne [95,164; 166,205; 115,70-71; see:end of chapter,pic.5].In 1797,Agha Mahammad shah arrested the Khan of Iravan,Mahammad Hüssein khan,as the latter was keeping in touch with Russian troops,and sent him to Tehran [95,164; 115,84].According to G.P.Butkov,when the Khan of Iravan,Mahammad Hüssein khan,came to Agha Mahammad shah to express his obedi-ence,the Shah had him (the Khan of Iravan – editor)arrested and sent together with his family to Gazvin [41,II,428].Agha Mahammad shah placed his own brother,Aligulu khan Gajar,in control of the Iravan Khanate to replace Mahammad Hüssein khan [95,164; 41,II,426; 200,9].Nevertheless,the people of Iravan rebelled against and dethroned Aligulu khan,as the latter was raising taxes [41,II,431; 214,185].Yet,G.Bournoutian presents this event differently,claiming that Aligulu khan Gajar hurried to Tehran in order to seize the throne right after his brother Agha Mahammad shah’s death (1797).Taking advantage of the situation,Hassan khan Makulu seized power in the Iravan Khanate and demanded heavy taxes from the population [214,185; 200,9].After the assassination of Agha Mahammad shah Gajar,his successor to the throne,Fatali shah Gajar (1797-1834),released the Khan of Iravan,54 T H E I R A В А Н K H A N A T E THE RUSSIAN OCCUPATION AND THE RELOCATION OF ARMENIANS TO THE LANDS OF NORTH AZERBAIJAN AZERBAIJAN NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES,A.A.BAKIKHANOV INSTITUTE OF HISTORY * According to the source,the Khan’s full name was Mahammad Hüssein khan [60,6].Western sources and literature provide interesting facts about Mahammad Hüssein khan Gajar.While describing V.Zubov’s assault on Azerbaijan in 1796,H.Busse presents Mahammad Hüssein khan as Ziyadoghlu [99,67].In yet another part of the source,Mahammad Hüssein khan is presented as Gajar Goyunlu [99,107,108,109] and is said to have carried the nickname “Lip” due to his big lips [99,109].According to G.Bournoutian’s records,Mahammad Hüssein khan Gajar belonged to the Goyunlu (Aghjagoyunlu – editor)branch of the Gajar tribe and was related to Agha Mahammad khan Gajar on his mother’s side [200,8].G.P.Butkov calculates that Mahammad Hüssein khan came to power in 1785 [41,II,177],while another source claims it happened in 1799 [82,5].However,considering the fact that Mahammad Hüssein khan Gajar came to power right after the assassination of his stepbrother Hüsseinali khan,then the records ascribing the event to the year of 1784 are more plausible.Mahammad Hüssein khan Gajar from prison [115,85].Mahammad Hüssein khan returned and regained the power,which he had forfeited for three months [200,9].Yet,Mahammad Hüssein khan did not want to be dependent on Fatali shah Gajar,despite the latter’s expectations.Therefore,after some time,in June 1805,shahzadah (prince-trans.)Abbas Mirza arrested Mahammad Hüssein khan Gajar and sent him to Iran [26,document 1256,page 626; 188,113].Some records claim that Mahammad Hüssein khan was suspended from power because of his two-edged policy [95,167],while others assert it was caused by his maintaining close relationships with the Ottoman state (at the time,the Gajars’ relationships with the Ottomans had deteriorated)[200,14-15].In reality,Mahammad Hüssein khan’s independent policy (this is described in more detail in Chapter V-editor)did not please the sov-ereign of the Gajar-ruled Iran – Fatali shah and Shahzadah Abbas Mirza.They were constantly looking for a chance to remove him from office and finally succeeded in this pursuit.According to some records,Mahammad Hüssein khan was replaced by Pirgulu khan Gajar in 1805 [95,167; 200,14-15].However,in reality,Mehdigulu khan Gajar* came to power after Mahammad Hüssein khan (in the summer of 1805)[26,document 1256,page 626; 82,5; 200,14-15],while Pirgulu khan Gajar was not the Khan of Iravan,but the military head of Iravan city.The author of “Garabaghnama”,Mir Mehdi Khazani,confirms that Mahammad Hüssein khan Gajar was replaced by Mehdigulu khan Gajar,and that Pirgulu Gajar was the head of the army [8,II,156].55 T H E I

sources state that Mehdigulu khan belonged to the Davali branch of the Gajars [see:98,193].Mehdigulu khan was one of Fatali shah Gajar’s renowned military leaders.He displayed great courage in the later wars with Russia [see:127,30].Despite the claims of another source indicating that Mehdigulu khan was governing the Iravan Khanate even before that – from 1804 [98,222],this statement is far from reality.Various sources confirm that Mahammad Hüssein khan Gajar was the Khan of Iravan precisely until mid June,1805.In August 1806,the population of Iravan rebelled against Mehdigulu khan as the latter had imposed heavy taxes upon them and was plundering the nation [26,document 1256,pages 626-627].In August of the same year,the Khan of Tabriz and Maragha – Ahmad khan-replaced Mehdigulu khan Gajar [82,5; 74,368-369].Ahmad khan set off from Tabriz to Iravan with a large troop of infantry and cavalry and succeeded to the throne of Mehdigulu khan.Despite having managed to earn the people’s respect,he remained in power for merely three months.He fell ill when an epidemic broke out in Iravan and could not manage state affairs properly.The Shahzadah (Abbas Mirza-editor)was deeply moved by this event,as Ahmad khan was his most reliable and renowned representative [98,285-286].Ahmad khan of Maragha died on October 17,1806.Although Mahammad Hüssein khan Gajar,who had been suspend-ed from power on Fatali shah’s demand,returned to Iravan [see:27,document 792,page 421],he failed to regain power.Soon after this,local government* strengthened once again in the Iravan Khanate and the last khan of the independent Iravan Khanate – Hüsseingulu khan Gajar (Goyunlu)** acceded to the throne [see:27,document 129,page 69-70; document 424,page 232; 95,167; 82,5;

[see:200,17-18].This fact once again proves that the dynasty of Gajars played a significant role in the Iravan Khanate.**Descendant of the Goyunlu (Aghjagoyunlu)branch of the Gajars,Hüsseingulu khan Gajar had served as the head of the royal nobility in Fatali khan’s palace and greatly helped Fatali shah to strengthen the throne after the assassination of Agha Mahammad Shah Gajar.During 1800-1802,he was the head of the highway guard in Gazvin,which controlled the roads leading to the capital city and was given the nickname of Gazvini for his bravery.In 1802,he was dispatched to Khorasan to subdue conflicts between the Afshars and he governed Khorasan for five years [see:200,17-18].Iravan-Hüsseingulu khan Gajar-the title of “sardar” (vicegerent)– i.e.,military leader of all the armed forces located on the left bank of the Araz River [200,17].The sardar of Iravan,Hüsseingulu khan Gajar,not only gained control over all the civil and military forces in the province,but was also provided with a large troop of infantry and cavalry [98,295].That is why contemporary sources refer to the last Khan of Iravan-Hüsseingulu khan Gajar-as the “Sardar of Iravan”.Hüsseingulu khan Gajar’s brother,Hassan khan Gajar,car-rier of the honorary title – “Aslanlar bashi* (King of Lions-trans.)-was the closest comrade-in-arms of the Iravan Khan in the fight against Russian invaders [see:8,II,63; 177,515; 127,96; 200,18].Ultimately,original sources confirm that the Azerbaijani state existing from 1747 till 1827 – the Iravan Khanate-was governed mostly by representatives of a local Turkish tribe of Azerbaijan,the Gajars,who fought decisively for the independence of the Iravan Khanate.57 T H E I R A В А Н K H A N A T E THE RUSSIAN OCCUPATION AND THE RELOCATION OF ARMENIANS

Azerbaijanand the beginning of Armenian settlement in the vicinity of Üchkilsa.The territory of the Iravan Khanate,which is an integral part of Azerbaijan,has been among the regions particularly densely populated by Azerbaijani Turks in different periods since ancient times.The Azerbaijani nation has written the richest and the most honourable pages of its history in this land.With the exception of Gregorian missionaries,the process of Armenian appearance on these territories began in 1441,after the Armenian Catholicate was moved from Cilicia to lands of the Azerbaijani Garagoyunlu state – Üchkilsa [34,326-327; 105,19].The deeds of purchase held in Matenadaran regarding the villages,lands and other property which the Üchkilsa Catholicos bought by creeping into the favour of Azerbaijani governors are plain proofs of this statement [see:end of chapter,table 1].A document held in Matenadaran dated 1687 describing the methods by which Armenians acquired Azerbaijani lands in the Iravan province carries special importance.The document states that we (Armenians – editor)“…are either purchasing,capturing,seizing,paying off,receiving as a gift or acquiring by force” the lands belonging to Azerbaijani Turks [51,28].An Armenian writer indicates that the landed property of the Armenian Church and Armenian secular feudalists was built up in the XV-XVIII centuries using these methods [51,28].It must be noted that until 1441,when the centre of the Armenian Catholicate was moved to the Chukhursad (Iravan)province,no village or land plot ever belonged to Armenians here.Starting from 1443,even the village of Üchkilsa (Valarshabad*),centre of the 71 AZERBAIJAN NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES,A.A.BAKIKHANOV INSTITUTE OF HISTORY T H E I R A В А Н K H A N A T E THE RUSSIAN OCCUPATION AND THE RELOCATION OF ARMENIANS TO THE LANDS OF NORTH AZERBAIJAN *The toponym Valarshabad,which has no interpretation in Armenian,is connected with the name of Valar shah (194-216),the son of Sanaturk (Sanatruk)of the Arshaki (Arsakli)dynasty.The toponym was Valarshabad for a long period of history before being distorted and changed into Vagharshabad (Վաղարշապատ)in Armenian literature.Valarshabad was founded by Valar shah [see:95,116; 190,29].Armenian Catholicate,was seized piecemeal from Azerbaijani Turks by different methods.For example,Grigor of Maku,appointed Catholicos of Üchkilsa (1443)by permission of the Azerbaijani Aghgoyunlu state governor Jahanshah,managed to purchase a part of Üchkilsa (Valarshabad)village which was the property of a renowned representative of Azerbaijan,the then young Saed bey,for 8 thousand and 40 dinars [105,100] and,3 years later,the remaining part of the village,together with 6 more villages,for 90 thousand dinars from a Muslim,Rustam [105,102; see:end of chapter,table 1].Taking advantage of the patronage of Garagoyunlu,Aghgoyunlu and Safavid states,the Üchkilsa Catholicos and their European sup-porters led the process of Armenian establishment and strengthening in this part of Azerbaijan.That is,according to an Armenian preacher,G.Kighamiyans,the “liberation movement” of Armenians began from the times they were managed by the Gregorian church,serving as the single centre,and European missionaries were addressing the Gregorians with the following statement:“If you are together with the Pope,just like us,you will become precious,just like us,and perhaps even achieve your independence”.In this way the Europeans trying to reach out to the East were kindling the religious flame in the Armenians who had moved from Cilicia to the territories of the Safavid state in the XVI-XVII centuries [117,3-4; 126,33].At first,the Armenians were settled not in the city of Iravan itself,but on the territories of the Üchkilsa Catholicate that they had managed to acquire,as well as adjacent areas.Thus,the Armenian Church,growing rich on account of its foreign supporters and Christian missionaries,was creating permanent residences for Armenians on the historic lands of Azerbaijan by purchasing new lands and villages from the Azerbaijani governors.The factors stimulating the settlement of Armenians on territories of the Üchkilsa (Chukhursad)beylerbeyi.It must be noted that the 72 AZERBAIJAN NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES,A.A.BAKIKHANOV INSTITUTE OF HISTORY T H E I R A В А Н K H A N A T E THE RUSSIAN OCCUPATION AND THE RELOCATION OF ARMENIANS TO THE LANDS OF NORTH AZERBAIJAN main events stimulating the settlement of Armenians in the Chukhur-sad beylerbeyi were the Safavid-Ottoman wars which occurred in the XVI-XVII centuries and the 1st half of the XVIII century.The local Muslim population – Azerbaijani Turks – were either perishing during the above-mentioned wars or were being forced to leave their native lands for belonging to the Shiite branch of Islam during the attacks of Ottoman army.For example,research based on primary sources of the time confirms that the local population left the Shöreyel and Talin mahals of the Iravan province for Aghridagh and the surrounding summer pastures when the Ottoman army headed by Farhad Pasha entered these areas in August 1583 [192,346].At such times,the Armenian Church,making use of the situation,purchased the Azerbaijani villages occupied by the Ottomans for favourable prices and settled the Armenians arriving here from different provinces of Turkey on these lands.It is worth mentioning that the Safavid ruler,Shah Abbas I (1587-1629)created extensive opportunities for the further strengthening of the Armenians who had settled in Üchkilsa and surrounding Azerbaijani lands.That is,the Armenians were granted significant privileges in the foreign trade relationships of the Safavids state and special concessions* were made to the Armenian Churches located on the state’s territory [174,181-182; 126,29,32].The Armenians settled in Üchkilsa at that time also confirmed this.Let us pay attention to one fact in this respect.Philippos the head of the Armenian community in Üchkilsa wrote in his address to Shah Abbas the Second (1642-1667):“The majority of those living in our province (i.e.the Armenians – editor)at present have been relocated here from different provinces thanks to the immense care 73 AZERBAIJAN NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES,A.A.BAKIKHANOV INSTITUTE OF HISTORY T H E I R A В А Н K H A N A T E THE RUSSIAN OCCUPATION AND THE RELOCATION OF ARMENIANS TO THE LANDS OF NORTH AZERBAIJAN * Such a caring attitude of the Safavid shahs towards Christians,as well as Armenians,was a result of the policy of “patronizing the Christians” living in Muslim countries of the East pursued by European states,as well as Shah Abbas the First’s policy of obtaining firearms from western countries for use in his wars against the Ottoman Empire.and love of Your Excellency.The 300 believers in Üchkilsa are praying for you day and night,as they are able to live here only due to the mercy of Your Excellency” [73,368-369; 126,32; see:end of chapter,document 2].One of the harshest outcomes of the Safavid-Ottoman wars of the XVI-XVII centuries for Azerbaijan was that Azerbaijanis had to leave their native lands.The Turkish-Muslim population of Iravan province had fallen to 67.5% as referenced in the “Müfassal Defter” of the Iravan province dated 1590 [6,13],and was down to 61.2% as referenced in the “Book of Review” dated 1728 [6,18].In the 1st half of the XVIII century,however,this process took on a different shape.For example,Nadir khan moved 300 families from Iravan province to Khorasan in 1735,when he liberated the area from the Ottomans [82,6-7].Benefiting from this opportunity,the Üchkilsa Catholicos took every opportunity to increase the number of Armenians in Iravan.For example,Nadir khan distributed Armenian captives to all of the Azerbaijani khans after his inauguration in Mughan (1736).At that time,sneaking into the khan’s favour,the Armenian Catholicos Abraham of Kenekir,with the help of Christian maliks,sent a number of the Armenian captives taken from Khorasan and other areas to Iravan in order to increase the number of Armenians on Azerbaijani territories [23,252-255].All of these factors caused visible changes in the demographic composition of the population of Iravan region in favour of the Armenians.The population of the Iravan Khanate.Despite all this,Azerbaijani Turks still held a vital position in the ethnic structure of the local population.Contemporary sources prove this statement.Missionary Monye,who was a member of the Jesuit Order,having arrived in Iravan on missionary work,writes:“The city,filled more with 74 AZERBAIJAN NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES,A.A.BAKIKHANOV INSTITUTE OF HISTORY T H E I R A В А Н K H A N A T E THE RUSSIAN OCCUPATION AND THE RELOCATION OF ARMENIANS TO THE LANDS OF NORTH AZERBAIJAN orchards and vineyards than with houses,is surrounded by double fortification walls.Armenians amount to ¼th of the population.” [100,154].Mami-Clerak,who visited Iravan in the XVIII century,not only benefited from Monye’s facts,but also edited them.The Armenian researcher A.G.Ionisyan also agrees with these figures and writes with reference to the French historian and engineer Mami-Clerak:“according to records,Armenians made up 1/4th of the population of Iravan city,while Azerbaijanis accounted for the larger majority.” [100,153; 35,LXXVII].Thus,the overwhelming majority of people living in the ancient region of Chukhursad (Iravan)and the Azerbaijani city of Iravan consisted of Azerbaijani Turks in this period,too.This is also confirmed by the records of the above-mentioned Armenian sources,precise facts provided by European travellers and missionaries who visited Iravan,toponyms contained in contemporary sources,as well as the lists of estate properties belonging to Azerbaijanis [see:end of chapter,document 1,Appendix 2].In addition,the fact that almost all of the 109 villages situated in the Shöreyel settlement were inhabited by Azerbaijani Turks is apparent also from the names of those villages,as seen by looking at the list of Iravan villages described in the book of Nadir shah [58,42,43; see:end of chapter,Appendix 1].Our toponyms recorded in the “Jambr”,which is considered to be a source from the 2nd half of the XVIII century,once again prove that the Armenians living in Üchkilsa and its vicinity were not a local population,but aliens [see:end of chapter,table 1,Appendix 2].The English diplomat James Moryer,who visited Iravan in 1813,mentions that the Iravan Khanate had a population of 100 thousand people,25 thousand of which were engaged in lowland-highland agriculture [102,256].According to Mahammad Hassan Valili,Iravan had a population of 115 thousand people at this time [133,22].75 AZERBAIJAN NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES,A.A.BAKIKHANOV INSTITUTE OF HISTORY T H E I R A В А Н K H A N A T E THE RUSSIAN OCCUPATION AND THE RELOCATION OF ARMENIANS TO THE LANDS OF NORTH AZERBAIJAN The main source for identifying the number and ethnic background of the population of the Iravan Khanate in the late XVIII-early XIX centuries is the Cameral Census developed by I.Shopen* (1829-1832 years)by order of Count I.F.Paskevich,fol-lowing the occupation of the Iravan Khanate [95].Nevertheless,one should always bear in mind that this census was created just after the occupation of the Iravan Khanate.On the eve of the Russian invasion,the total Christian** population in the Iravan Khanate was not above 20%.A Western historian of Armenian background,G.Bournoutian,grounding his research on that conducted by I.Shopen also admits this fact [see:200,59; 201,78; 145,121].In addition,the author states the following regarding the number of Armenians on the territory of the Iravan Khanate:“In no way did the Armenian population either constitute a majority,or equal the number of Muslims at any time during the Persian government(during the period of independent Iravan Khans-editor).Although research indicates that the number of Armenians was higher in certain districts,this occurred after more than 25 thousand Muslims left those areas,therefore there is no proof regarding an Armenian majority during the Persian administration” [200,59-60].Original sources provide abundant information about the Muslim population*** living on the territories of the Iravan Khanate and constituting over 80% of the population.The Saadli,Rumlu,Ustajli,Alpout,Bayat and other Azerbaijani tribes living in Chukhursad province from ancient times,played a significant role in the governance of the Iravan district.However,from the leadership of Shah Abbas I,the leading role in the district’s administration passed to the 76 AZERBAIJAN NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES,A.A.BAKIKHANOV INSTITUTE OF HISTORY T H E I R A В А Н K H A N A T E THE RUSSIAN OCCUPATION AND THE RELOCATION OF ARMENIANS TO THE LANDS OF NORTH AZERBAIJAN * Shopen Ivan Ivanovich (1798-1870)– this man of German ancestry,who had spent a long time in military service in the Caucasus,prepared the district census by order of the military leader of the Caucasus,I.F.Paskevich,and published it in 1852.The census is an irreplaceable source in studying the demographic condition and ethnic composition of the Iravan Khanate,both before and after the Russian invasion.Detailed information is provided in Chapter IX.** In order to artificially increase the number of Armenians living on the territory of the Iravan Khanate,most Armenian authors count all the Christians living in these areas (Gypsies,Georgians,,Aysors,Christian Kurds,and Jews etc.)as Armenians and thereby falsify the history of Iravan for the benefit of Armenians.For example,it is mentioned that 100 rich Gypsy Christian families lived in Iravan city [38,12].*** The numerous Azerbaijani Turks and Muslim Kurdish tribes relocated,mostly by the Ottomans,to the area during the Ottoman-Safavid wars are recorded as the “Muslim population”.Aghjagoyunlu Gajar tribe,another ancient inhabitant of the land [173,141].According to I.Shopen’s records,the following Azerbaijani-Turkish tribes,differing in numbers,were living in the Iravan Khanate:about 5000 Garapapags,almost 3000 Ayrumlus,as well as the Great Chobangaras,Saadlis,Seyidli-Akhsaglis (Aghsaggallis – editor),Mughanlis,Shahdilli* and Sadarakli branches of the Gajars,Jalalis and others,each amounting to a thousand or more people [95,535-538; see:table 2].It should be taken into consideration that the numbers of these tribes were calculated after the majority of the Garapapag and Ayrumlu,as well as some other tribes,had abandoned the Khanate’s territories in the period following the Russian occupation.According to the data provided by I.Shopen,49,875 Muslims (Azerbaijani Turks – editor),324 Kurds and 20,073 Armenians were living in the Iravan Khanate on the eve of the occupation [95,636-642].This fact should also be considered when identifying the precise size of the Muslim (Azerbaijani)population inhabiting the Iravan Khanate.There is no record of the existence of a Muslim (Azerbaijani)population in 153 of 521 villages located in the Iravan Khanate [200,38].Certainly,the Azerbaijani population of these villages either died during military operations,or had to leave the Khanate following the Russian occupation.If each of these villages consisted on average of 25 families,which in turn consisted of 5 members** each as a minimum,we can assume that at least 19,125 people inhabited those villages.According to I.Shopen’s other records,“There were 521 settlements and 310 abandoned***villages in the Iravan Khanate” [95,509-517].If each of those villages contained at least 25 families,which had at least 5 members each,then we have 125 people living in each of those villages and adding here the population of those 310 abandoned villages we get 38750 people living on these territories.**** 77 AZERBAIJAN NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES,A.A.BAKIKHANOV INSTITUTE OF HISTORY T H E I R A В А Н K H A N A T E THE RUSSIAN OCCUPATION AND THE RELOCATION OF ARMENIANS TO THE LANDS OF NORTH AZERBAIJAN * In his book,G.Bournoutian represents them as “Shahdai” [see:200,231].** It is known that Muslim families had many children and the assumption of 5-member families is conditional.***Undoubtedly,the population of those 310 abandoned villages consisted of Azerbaijani Turks.They either had to leave their native lands,or were thrown out by force.****This is the estimated number of Azerbaijani Turks forced to leave Azerbaijan only between 1828-1832.Thus,the Muslim-Turkic population of the Iravan Khanate on the eve of Russian occupation equalled at least 107,750 people.On the other hand,the Armenian population on the eve of Russian occupation accounted for around 18% of the total population.In addition,the Western historian of Armenian origin,G.Bournoutian,also mentions that Armenians not only never constituted a majority in the Iravan Khanate,but they were never even equal in number to Azerbaijanis.* Sources contain no data to refute this fact [200,60].Numerous facts prove that thousands of Muslims (Azerbaijani Turks – editor)emigrated from these original Azerbaijani lands,while Armenians were relocated there from Iran and the Ottoman Empire.Eventually,the Christian population increased significantly in number (detailed information is provided in Chapter IX).The population of the Iravan city.Unlike the Iravan area,the above-mentioned demographic processes did not cause serious changes in the ethnic composition of Iravan city.Original sources also confirm that the population inhabiting Iravan city always consisted entirely of Azerbaijani Turks.For example,when the XVII century French traveller Charden visited Iravan (1673),Safigulu khan was the beylerbeyi of Chukhursad and governor of Iravan.Charden mentions that he was fond of art and science and enjoyed everybody’s respect [10,23].According to the traveller,“… the Iravan Fortress contains approximately eight hundred houses.Only the Qizilbashs of pure blood (i.e.,Azerbaijani Turks – editor)live here” [10,21].In addition,another traveller – the German Caspari Schillinger,who visited Iravan city in the spring of 1700,also confirms that Azerbaijani Turks held the absolute majority in the city,both in number and in politics.He writes:“Only Iranians** (Azerbaijani 78 AZERBAIJAN NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES,A.A.BAKIKHANOV INSTITUTE OF HISTORY T H E I R A В А Н K H A N A T E THE RUSSIAN OCCUPATION AND THE RELOCATION OF ARMENIANS TO THE LANDS OF NORTH AZERBAIJAN * The population in 15 districts of the Iravan Khanate totalled 115,155 people [see:95,635-638].** The travellers arriving from European countries in the Safavids state usually received information from the Catholicos of Üchkilsa.These missionary-travellers called the Safavid state the “Iranian state” and Azerbaijani Turks “Iranians” under their influence.The actual history of the Iravan Khanate,irrefutable original sources,particularly the fact that the names of all the locations in the area were in Azerbaijani Turkish,proves that the ancient population inhabiting these lands was precisely Azerbaijani Turk.Turks – editor)live inside Iravan city (i.e.,within the city’s fortified walls – editor),while Armenian merchants and craftsmen live in the city’s relatively bigger settlement (probably,in Üchkilsa – editor)and in various areas to serve the church.They pay tribute to the Iranians (Azerbaijani Turks – editor)” [224,118].Speaking about the population of Iravan in his book titled “Ancient Iravan”,Y.Shahaziz once again confirms the records of the French traveller Charden regarding the people living in the Iravan Fortress and points out another interesting fact.He writes that Armenians only had shops there (in Iravan city – editor),they traded there during the day and closed their shops and headed for home in the evenings” [215,34; 116.5-6].If we take into account that information provided by Armenians to Russia and other Christian countries of Europe was distorted and the number of Armenians always artificially exaggerated,one may conclude that there never was a settled population of Armenians living in Iravan city itself.Archive documents from the early XVIII century also confirm that a settled population of Armenians did not inhabit Iravan city even at that time.The documents contained in the 1st half of the 2nd edition of the documents describing Armenian-Russian relationships provide interesting information.In a document titled “Notes of Memory” dated 25 July 1701,an Armenian adventurer,Israil Ori,presents an 18-clause draft to Peter I,tempting the latter to invade the South Caucasus.The draft’s 7th clause provides intelligence data to the Russian emperor about Iravan city and points out that only a little more than 300 Armenians are living in Iravan city and are engaged in trade [35,213; 126,31].It should be taken into consideration that the Europeans,including the missionaries in Iravan,were receiving information about the city’s Christian population from the Üchkilsa Catholicos.Thus,that data was often intentionally exaggerated and did not reflect reality.Nevertheless,European travellers,Charden,79 AZERBAIJAN NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES,A.A.BAKIKHANOV INSTITUTE OF HISTORY T H E I R A В А Н K H A N A T E THE RUSSIAN OCCUPATION AND THE RELOCATION OF ARMENIANS TO THE LANDS OF NORTH AZERBAIJAN Schillinger,archive documents of the XVIII century and even the Armenian author Shahaziz,all indicate that Azerbaijanis accounted for the entire population of the Iravan Fortress and an absolute majority in Iravan city.There are also other records regarding the numbers of people inhabiting Iravan city.J.Perri,referring to the records of different sources writes that Iravan city had a population of 20 thousand people during the rule of Karim khan Zand (1759-1779)[210,230].A.Muriel refers to Iravan as the most densely populated city of the South Caucasus [197,12].As we can see,local Azerbaijani Turks constituted the majority of the population in the Iravan Khanate.They governed the Khanate and had absolute control of the political administration.However,specifically for the above-mentioned reasons,Armenians managed to settle in the western lands of Azerbaijan – firstly in the Chukhursad beylerbeyi and later in the Iravan Khanate.In general,no source belonging to the early XIX century – the period prior to the Russian invasion – confirms the collective habitation of Armenians on Azerbaijani territories at the time.In conclusion,comparative analysis of the official documents mentioned,archive materials compiled at different times,the records of Christian missionaries and travellers of the times,Armenian authors,as well as the data provided in scientific literature,confirm the following regarding the population of the Iravan Khanate:-Much of the Shiite population of Azerbaijan’s western territories was forced to leave their native lands due to the Ottoman-Safavid wars launched in the early XVI century,which led to a decrease of the area’s Azerbaijani Turkish population,even if temporary;-the Armenian Church,benefiting from the change of government,acquired abandoned Turkish (Azerbaijani-editor)80 AZERBAIJAN NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES,A.A.BAKIKHANOV INSTITUTE OF HISTORY T H E I R A В А Н K H A N A T E THE RUSSIAN OCCUPATION AND THE

nearby villages of the Chukhursad Beylerbeyi had increased by the beginning of the XVIII century.However,Armenians had failed to settle collectively in Iravan city and the villages in its vicinity,even then,and were only temporarily engaged in merchandise and missionary activities.81 AZERBAIJAN NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES,A.A.BAKIKHANOV INSTITUTE OF HISTORY T H E I R A В А Н K H A N A

99-108 The village first belonged to the young Saed bey who was a representative of a famous Azerbaijani generation.In 1443 the Catholocos of Üchkilsa Makulu Grigor bought some part of the village from him.But there soon arose a scandal,the Azerbaijani Malak khatun and 14 property owners laid a claim and regained their sold estate.In 1445 Catholicos Grigor again bought some part of the village from Muslim Rustam.In 17th century the Üchkilsa Catholicos Serdpion (1603-1625)had it confirmed by the İravan beylerbeyi Amirgüna khan Gajar (1604-1625),that the village and taxes paid for their estates belonged to Üchkilsa.The İravan beylerbeyi Tahmasibgulu khan ( 1625-1635)returned the estates to the treasury lands of Valarshabad and granted the Muslims (Azerbaijani-Turks-editor)of the village,who first owned the estates,buying and conceding rights.* The place-name “Valarshabad” has no explanation in Armenian.This toponym is associated with Valar shah (194-216)the son of Sanaturk (Sanatruk)who belonged to the dynasty of Arshakis ( Arsaklis).This place-name was “Valarshabad” for a long time,but in Armenian sources it was distorted and became “Vagharshabad” ("Վաղարշապատ").Valarshabad was founded by Valar shah [ see:95,116,190,29].83 AZERBAIJAN NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES,A.A.BAKIKHANOV INSTITUTE OF HISTORY T H E I R A В А Н K H A N A T E THE RUSSIAN

favour and had it confirmed that the village belonged to Üchkilsa.Amirguna khan’s son Abbasgulu bey (1663-1666)again returned the estates of Valarshabad to the village treasury.The Catholicos of Üchkilsa Julfali Hakop (1655-1682)crept into Süleyman Shah’s favour and bought the village as ragam.The Catholicos of Üchkilsa Nakhapet (1691-1709)strengthened the village and its estates as ragam in the rule of Shah Sultan Hüssein (1694-1722).The Catholicos of Üchkilsa Astva-satur (1714-1730)crept into the favour of Ottoman warlord Rajab Pasha (1724-1727)and was able to get confirmation of the church’s ownership of Valarshabad and its estates and obtain some other villages.The catholicos of Üchkilsa Abraham of Kanakirli could creep into Nadir shah’s (1734-1736)favour and had confirimed the belonging of those villages to Uchkilsa.2 The village of Oshagan* Garbi mahal 37,108-112 Üchkilsa bought the village for the first time from Sultan bey,who belonged to the Saadli tribe.The village was the hereditary property of Azerbaijani Turks,who belonged to the Mughanli tribe.The local Azerbaijani-Turks were able to regain the villages of Baba,Bangali and Bayim but they were once again obliged to sell them to the Catholicos.* The root of the word “Oshagan” or “Ushagan” is the same as that of the mountain of the same name [170,197].According to researchers,in Altay languages “oshig” means” a ravine of the mountain,much weathered by the wind” [110,351].84 AZERBAIJAN NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES,A.A.BAKIKHANOV INSTITUTE OF HISTORY T H E I R A В А Н K H A N A T E THE RUSSIAN OCCUPATION AND

of the Ottoman war-lord Rajab Pasha,got confirmation of the church’s ownership of the village.3 Franganosс* Garbi mahal 112-114 This was the property of Iravanli Amir bey’s son Abdulla.He sold the village to Haji Khizir oghlu Haji Ibrahim and Süleyman.Then the village was sold to other Azerbaijani-Turkic inhabitants-an inhabitant of the village of Aralig Ali Agha,after his death to his sons Ibrahim,Yagub and Mammad,his daugh-ter Hüri khanim and their dead brother Teymur khan’s wife and finally Hüssein khan’s daughter Bayim khanim.But the Catholicos Julfali Akop got the village back again.In the period of Catholicos Abraham,the village was bought by one of the former owners,Mustafa bey.As a result of the Safavid-Ottoman wars,the village was ruined.In 1760 the Catholicos of Üchkilsa,Shamakhili Hakop (1759-1763)got permission from the khan of Iravan Hüsseinali khan Gajar (1759-1783)to relocate Armenians from various places.Thus,the church of Üchkilsa re-possessed the village.*Franganos is mentioned in 1728 as Firang in the Notebook of Commentary.In the14th century Italian Catholic missionaries came to the Iravan province and spread their Catholic faith and were able to have the faith adopted in some villages.They built an Abbey which Azerbaijani Turks called “ Firang”,but the Armenian church grigorianised these villages gradually.[ see:95,327; 110-397].85

village then passed through many hands.At the beginning of the 18th century the Catholicos of Üchkilsa,Julfali Aleksandr (1707-1714),obtained the village.The sales document is in Turkic.5 Kirashli or Piridarvish Aparan mahal 116-117 Catholicos Grigor bought the village from Amir Rüstam.Later,in the period of Catholicos Julfali Akop,a Muslim,by name Gassim,complained that the village belonged to him,but the khan of Iravan and Sheykhülislam rejected his claim.At the end of the17th century,Hajibey Shahgaldi’s son Allahverdi bey Gajar regained the properties of the village.At the beginning of the 18th century,Iravanli Emin’s sons Aligulu and Zeynalabdin presented documents to the court inherited from their mother and claimed that the village belonged to them.Catholicos Nakhapet paid money and kept the village in his hands.Catholicos Abraham crept into the favour of Nadir Shah Afshar,took posession of the village again in 1735 and had it confirmed that it belonged to Üchkilsa.6 Mughni** Garbi mahal 117-119 Catholicos Grigor bought the village for the first time,from Amir Rüstam.But in the period of Julfali Akop,Iravanli Abdulbaghi and his son Alidostu complained to Shah Abbas II (1642-1667)that the properties of the village belonged to them and the Catholicos was using them illegally.*Masdara” is the combination of two words “mas” in Turkic languages means “ the southern,treeless part of the mountain”,“dara” means “valley”,i.e.“ treeless valley,naked valley”.[165,369].In the Gadabey region of Azerbaijan there is a Maskhit mountain and in Ordubad there is a Masnis moun-tain.Both names have the same origin as Masdara[110,332].**Mughni – is closely connected with the name of the ancient population of the Mughanli tribe in the Iravan region.For example,in a source from the 18th century-“Jambr” the name of the Mughanli tribe is mentioned several times [105,37,105 and so on].86 AZERBAIJAN NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES,A.A.BAKIKHANOV INSTITUTE OF HISTORY T H

Abbas II instructed the khan of Iravan,Najafgulu bey,to settle the prob-lem.But it couldn’t be completed due to Abdulbaghi’s death.Abdulbaghi’s wife,Shahribanu,with her brother Yusif raised the claim again.But the Üchkilsa officials managed to settle the problem in favour of the church,creeping into the favour of Sheikhülislam in different ways.Although,in 1760,Iravanli Hüsseinali khan’s vicegerent Ibrahim Agha returned the properties of the village,in 1768 Üchkilsa regained posession of the village.7 Dibakli Aparan mahal 119 At the end of the 16th century Goyul-hi sarli Vali Agha’s sons Mahammad Agha and Ahmad Agha sold this village to Caliph Alpout Khalil’s son,Caliph Ibrahim.In 1682 Hajibeyli Shahgaldi’s son Allahverdi Gajar ( they belonged to the Gajars tribe)returned this village with its properties,including the villages of Kirashli and Keshishkand.But at the beginning of the18th century,Vardapet Stepan complained to the Khan of Iravan (Chukhursad beylerbeyi-editor)and was able to buy the properties of the village again.Abraham Kanakirli (1734-1736)crept into the favour of Nadir Shah (1736-1747)and had it confirmed that the village belonged to Üchkilsa.8 Keshish-kand* or Aydindar-vish or Chalabikand Qirkhbulag mahal 120 The village belonged to Gülfarhad Agha.In the 1670s,Catholicos Akop bought the properties of the village from his son

all its properties from a person named Sarikhan,obtained its pre-vious documents.11 Egvard*** Qirkhbulag mahal 122-123 Initially the properties of the village belonged to Muradbey.The Armenian Akopjan complained to Shah Abbas II and obtained the village.Later the properties of the village came to the state as khalisa lands.But in 1768,in the period of Hüsseinali khan (1759-1783),the Catholicoses of Üchkilsa took poses-sion of these lands.12 Yayıjı Darachichak mahal 124-125 This village belonged to Khoja Set (Sarikhan)in former times.In 1660 the Catholicos of Üchkilsa,Julfali Akop,was able to take posession of the village.*The name of the village was translated from Azerbaijani-Turkic into Armenian,which means “ a new village” **In the Middle Ages in Armenian sources it was written as “Nork” and the Turkic version was “Norug”.As the inhabitants of the village were engaged in pottery (cholmakchilik),the real name of the village was Cholmakchilik-trans.***This toponym belongs to

means “pine”.[ see:110-259].** The word Aghav in the place names of “Aghavatun” and “ Aghavyurd” doesn’t have a meaning in Armenian.Perhaps these words belong to Azerbaijani Albanians.*** This place

total number of the population of the Mughanli tribe was calculated by G.Bournoutian.Socio-economic life 3 The socio-economic life of the Iravan Khanate was an integralpart of the socio-economic relationships in Azerbaijan as a whole.In the XVIII century,production of commodities was quite advanced in western Azerbaijan – the Aghri Valley,Nakhchivan,Gapan and the surrounding provinces – and made an important contribution to the country’s economy.The Iravan Khanate maintained extensive trading relationships with other Azerbaijani khanates,as well as with foreign countries.As far back as in the early XVIII century,Russian ambassador Volinsky wrote,during a trip to Iravan:“The best of the districts located across the area from Iran to the Turkish border,are Iravan and Tabriz.They are abundant in bread and bring vast income to the Safavid state through trade” [155,11].The Russian agent Reynegs,visiting Iravan in 1782,also reported that the Iravan Khanate was as rich as Garabagh and Garadagh and was producing cotton fabric,silk,spring wheat,wine and a wide variety of quality products [37,215-216].Agriculture and stock-breeding.The goods exported from the Iravan Khanate were mostly agriculture* products.Wheat and barley featured strongly among these goods.The regions surrounding Iravan – Qirkhbulag,Sardarabad,Shöreyel and Pambak-were engaged in grain production.The seed-fields consisted mostly of spring-sown and autumn-sown fields.In mountainous areas,grain products were usually sown in autumn,in *Interestingly,even in his book written under the influence of Armenians and by assignment of the Russian Duke Paskevich,who was trying to create a state for Armenians in the occupied territories of North Azerbaijan,I.Shopen gave the names of most agriculture products in the language of the local population – in Azerbaijani Turkish.For example,arpa (barley-trans.),bughda (wheat –trans.),kunjut (sesame-trans.),pambig (cotton – trans.),genegerchek (castor-trans.),etc.[see:95,738-746].All of this proves once again that the local population of the Iravan Khanate possessing the ancient culture of farming were Azerbaijani Turks.103 AZERBAIJAN NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES,A.A.BAKIKHANOV INSTITUTE OF HISTORY T H E I R A В А Н K H A N A T E THE RUSSIAN OCCUPATION AND THE RELOCATION OF ARMENIANS TO THE LANDS OF NORTH AZERBAIJAN the lowlands in spring [see:95,738-740; 71,IV,278].During the reign of Hüsseingulu khan Gajar,34,185 khalvars* of wheat and 11,500 khalvars of barley was produced in the Iravan Khanate every year [71,IV,280].In addition,the production of coarse rice also occupied an important place in agriculture.Rice was sown mainly in the lowlands and places needing lots of water.The Zangibassar and Sharur mahals(district-trans.)were especially known for the production of rice [71,IV,278].The lowland areas of the Saatli,Garbibassar and Garnibassar mahals were also noted for production of this crop [95,741].The Iravan Khanate was producing 18,400 khalvars of raw rice every year.[71,IV,280].Of the industrial crops,cotton was planted mostly in the lowlands of the Iravan Khanate.The districts of Zangibassar,Sardarabad and Sürmali were well-known for cotton production [95,743; 71,edition IV,278-279].On average,2100 khalvars of cotton was produced in the Iravan Khanate every year [71,IV,280].The population of the Iravan Khanate was also engaged in tobacco production.The tobacco was typically produced to meet local demand [95,745].In addition,linen was produced in the highlands and lowlands of the Iravan Khanate and sesame only in the lowlands.The oil obtained from both plants was used as food and fuel [95,741-742.During the reign of Hüusseingulu khan,the Iravan Khanate was producing,on average,12 khalvars of linen seed and 24 khalvars of sesame per year [71,IV,280; see:end of chapter,table 6,7].Sericulture was a widespread branch of agriculture in the Iravan Khanate.I.Shopen mentioned that the existence of many mulberry gardens on the territory of the Iravan Khanate spoke of the important role once played by the silk industry there [95,753].Viniculture had a very long history in the Iravan Khanate.The Khanate was always distinguished for its abundant orchards and * 1 khalvar equals to 28 pouds (1 poud – 16 kg – editor)and 4 pounds THE RUSSIAN

vineyards.However,most of them were either destroyed or left ownerless due to the wars.Information about the number,size and profitability of the orchards and vineyards in the territories of the Iravan Khanate after the Russian occupation is contained in Russian sources of the XIX century (see:end of chapter,table 8,9).Yet the list does not include the orchards and vineyards in the districts of Göycha,Darachichak and Abaran.This is because those districts suffered most destruction during the Russian occupation [see:95,747; 71,IV,281-282].Various kinds of garden plants and vegetables were planted in Iravan city and in the adjoining villages,as well as in other cities and districts of the country [see:95,745-746].The contemporary sources indicate that even representatives of other countries were arriving in Iravan to obtain seeds from orchard plants.In March 1782,seeds of black and blue watermelon,mursagulu,cucumber,surahi,sweet basil,henna,aubergine etc.,to the value of 7000 dinars and 2 abbasis,were shipped from Iravan to Bayazid by request of Isak Pasha of Bayazid.In 1784,Irakli II sent Zohrab of Argut to the Üchkilsa Catholicos to fetch some seeds [214,41-42].Interestingly,the names of all these seeds are recorded in the account book of the Üchkilsa Monastery in Azerbaijani Turkish.The fact that the names of these seeds were written in Azerbaijani Turkish in the sources of the time once again proves that Azerbaijani Turks had been living here since ancient times and were engaged in established lines of production,especially in crop farming and other fields of agriculture,while Armenians arrived in these lands later.Summer-winter cattle-breeding,typical of the whole of Azerbaijan,had developed in the Aghri Valley.Cattle farming taxes were bringing in a lot of income for the Iravan Khanate.The population engaged in cattle-breeding were not only paying taxes,but also serving the khan as a military force with their horses and armed groups.For example,the big Chobangara clan (300 families)was paying 100 tümans in tax.The clan was supposed to provide 300 cavalry for military service.The khan had also entrusted the care of his own animals to this clan.They were expected to obtain half a batman of oil and cheese from every sheep.The wool of the sheep was given as a gift to those looking after the animals [141,235; 214,43].In addition,cattle-breeders were supposed to pay taxes to their own chiefs,assist with the work of the chiefs and their relatives and present gifts to them at holidays [141,228-229; 214,43].In the second half of the XVIII century,the part of the population engaged in cattle-breeding in the Iravan Khanate was producing oil,cheese and other milk products to sell at markets.Sheep farming had advanced more than the other forms of cattle-breeding.The pastures of the Qirkhbulag,Göycha,Abaran,Darachichak,Garnibassar,Vedibassar,Talin,Sürmali and Darakand-Parcheniz districts were the most suitable for cattle-breeding [see:95,523-525].The khanate’s entire population had flocks and herds in their yards [see:end of chapter,table 10].Cattle-breeding was mainly divided into two parts:summer-winter and partially nomadic cattle-breeding.In families engaged in summer-winter cattle-breeding,some family members were engaged directly in these activities,while others remained in the permanent settlements and engaged in husbandry.These were mostly Azerbaijani Turks.A small portion of the khanate’s population did not have permanent settlements and was engaged only in cattle-breeding.These were mainly the relocated Kurds [see:95,519-523].Craftsmanship and trade.Zakariyya Kanakirli reported that the Aghri region was productive,abundant in various products and inexpensive; therefore people from all over arrived in Iravan,bought whatever they needed and returned home; at the same time,many caravans arrived from Tabriz to buy rice,cotton,melted butter,cheese,fat tail of certain breeds of sheep,fat,vegetable oil,leather THE RUSSIAN OCCUPATION AND THE RELOCATION OF ARMENIANS TO THE LANDS OF NORTH AZERBAIJAN T H E I R A В А Н K H A N A T E AZERBAIJAN NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES,A.A.BAKIKHANOV INSTITUTE OF HISTORY 106 and other products and left [66,153].Iravan was shipping cotton to Tiflis,Erzurum,Akhalsikh and Kars,rice,wheat and barley to Tabriz,Khoy,Bayazid and Van,as well as salt to Kars,Bayazid and different areas of Georgia.Exports of all these products amounted to 3000 silver rubles every year.In addition,grain – barley,wheat,millet etc.– was also exported [71,IV,284; 214,46].Being an important contributor to the economic life of the Iravan Khanate,caftsmanship included various occupations.The traditional crafts of Azerbaijan – weaving and pottery – were also developed in the Iravan Khanate.Weaving,including carpet-weaving,was especially prominent.As the main population of the khanate,consisting of Azerbaijani Turks,they kept sheep rather than pigs,wove beautiful carpets,sacks,rugs and saddlecloth,as well as warm clothes,gloves,socks etc.for wearing in winter [see:71,IV,282-283].Therefore,I.Shopen reports that every family had a weaver’s loom* [see:95,851-853].The khanate’s pottery production used local raw materials.Some villages even specialized in this craft.That is why I.Shopen mentions that pottery mills were operating in all mahals of the Iravan Khanate [see:95,862].Another field,related to weaving,was dyeing.Different types of qirmiz (cochineal)** dye were in wide use on the khanate’s territory.Gammel,an academician of the Russian Academy of Sciences,conducting special research into this dyeing substance,compared Iravan qirmiz with Mexican qirmiz for its effectiveness [see:71,IV,259-266; 95,859-860].Leather processing had also advanced in the Iravan Khanate.Not only local raw leather was used here,but also that brought from * Based on this statement by I.Shopen,it can be said that the khanate’s main population consisted of Azerbaijani Turks.Because,as the Christian population kept only pigs as a rule,they could not be engaged in weaving.** The dye obtained mostly from the qirmiz beetle is named “koshenil” (cochineal – trans.)in Russian sources.THE RUSSIAN OCCUPATION AND THE RELOCATION OF ARMENIANS TO THE LANDS OF

also used to meet the demands of the cavalry.In addi-tion,glass production,soap-making,butter-making and other crafts were practised in the Iravan Khanate [see:95,858,856,861-862].Industrial production had also started to develop in the Iravan Khanate.The Goghb* (Qoghb)salt refinery,located near Iravan city [see:end of chapter,pic.10] together with the Nakhchivan salt refinery,supplied the entire South Caucasus with salt.Salt was shipped from Goghb to Georgia,Imeretya,Akhalsikh and other places [42,72; 214,43-44].I.Shopen writes that as the demand for salt was high,two refineries placed 50 sajenes (1 sajene = 7 feet – trans.)apart were operating at the foot of Gulp (Goghb – editor)mountain [95,824; see:pic.9].Hüsseingulu khan Gajar had assigned three of his close men to control the refineries and was paying them a high salary.I.Shopen writes that during Hüsseingulu khan Gajar’s reign an immense income – 14000 silver rubles per year – was obtained from salt production [see:95,827].Several types of salt were extracted at the Goghb refinery located in Gulp (Goghb – editor)village.The salt was noted for its composition and quality.Most of the salt was exported to the pashaliks of Garabagh,Georgia and Bayazid [71,IV,268-269].One of the most important and profitable areas of the economy of the Iravan Khanate,as well as of the other Azerbaijani khanates,was * The toponym “Goghb” (Qoghb)has no interpretation in the Armenian language.Gogh is an ancient Turkish word meaning “light,rays of the sun” [7,148].The salt mountain was called this because it shone under the sun’s rays.Such toponyms are a proof that these lands have belonged to Turks since ancient times.(At present,the main part of that salt mine is called Tuzluja and is located on the territory of the Republic of Turkey.The mine’s other part,located on the left bank of the Araz River,is called “Aghveran” by Armenians.The toponym “Aghveran” is also Azerbaijani Turkish.Armenians call salt “agh”,which is an Azerbaijani Turkish word (meaning white – trans.).That is why the mine was later called Agh veran (providing the white /salt – trans.)).The name of the salt mine is mentioned as Gulp (Kulp)or Kokhp [60,16; 71,IV,267-268; 95,283,284,824 etc.].An Armenian author,B.R.Grigoryan,presented the mine’s name as Goghb [214,43].It is mentioned that the mine was located in a mountain 30 versts from the Sardarabad fortress on the left bank of Araz,and 50 versts from the Iravan Fortress,and covered an area of more than 8 versts,together with its surroundings [71,IV,268].THE RUSSIAN

domestic trade.The Iravan Khanate earned a large income from caravan roads and their protection.That is,several important caravan roads traversed the Khanate’s territory leading to other khanates of Azerbaijan and foreign countries.As far back as the XVII century,a merchant named Aylisli Zakariyya described some of these roads,providing significant information about the rahdar and customs stations in his diary.He notes that these stations were controlled by three ranks of officials:rahdar,bajchi(tax collector-trans.)and gömrukchu (customs officer – trans.).* The first group operated in large and small administrative stations and posts to protect the roads,while the other two groups served in border cus-toms stations [104,7-8].As the Iravan (Chukhursad)region was located at the crossroads of trade routes leading to different countries,it participated closely in the international trade relationships of Azerbaijan.Therefore,the Iravan Khanate had many bridges,caravanserais,mints and bazaars on its territories [see:end of chapter,pic.1,2,3,4,5,8,9].The first was the caravan road connecting India,Central Asia and Iran to the Iravan Khanate through Tabriz and Nakhchivan.The road went on to Erzurum,passing through Iravan,Valarshabad and Kaghizman.This caravan road was called the “Erzurum Road” or the “Bazirgan (merchant-trans.)Road”.Another caravan route leading from Iravan to Erzurum passed the northern slopes of the Abaran and Alagöz mountains to reach Kars and eventually Hassangala,where it connected to the main road [104,7-8].The caravan route from Iravan to Tiflis passed through Üchkilsa,Sardarabad,Hamamli,Jalaloghlu and Shulaver [214,46].A French traveller of the XVII century,J.Charden,also reported on this road.It was roughly equal * While in his book,Aylisli Zakariyya used the terms” rahdar,bajchi and gömrukchü” in the Azerbaijani language [104,7],the edition translated into Russian uses only the Russian

road:Bjni,Garakeshish,Dalijan,Gara Dash,Malikkand and Körpükand [223,141-156].With the help of this road,Iravan maintained contact with Ganja and was connected to the main trade route in Shamakhi leading from Azerbaijan to Russia.There were a lot of customs and rahdar stations on the caravan roads.Six customs stations and a rahdar station were based just on the trade route from Aylis to Kaghizman [104,7].The system existing in the XVII century progressed further in the second half of the XVIII century,in the period of the khanates.The main trade routes of the Iravan Khanate,which entered the system of cameral description in 1829-1832,were the following:1.Gümrü – Masdara – Sardarabad – Üchkilsa – Iravan – Nakhchivan-Ordubad; 2.Sardarabad – Jafaragha-Bayazid Pashalik; 3.Sardarabad – Goghb – Kaghizman along the Araz bank – Erzurum; 4.Iravan – to the borders of the former Garabagh Khanate.This road stretches for 161 versts (a Russian unit of distance equals to 1.067 kilometres (0.6629 miles)– trans.); 5.Iravan – Üchkilsa – Kars.This road went through the villages of Qizilkilsa and Goshavang [95,718-721].The khanate’s major trade centre was the city of Iravan.Trading goods imported from foreign countries were mainly held in the city’s warehouses.Various products exported from the Iravan Khanate were delivered to foreign countries [71,IV,285; 95,883-884].Alongside foreign trade,domestic trade had also developed in the Iravan Khanate.Shops,mints,public squares and caravanserais played a vital role in the growth of internal trade [see:end of chapter,tables 1,2,3; pic.5].The number of shops located in different parts of Iravan city [see:table 4] totalled 851 [see:tables 1,2,3].Different units of weight and length were used in the Iravan Khanate in foreign trade operations [see:end of chapter,table 4].Various types of currency were used in the implementation of both foreign and domestic trading operations in the Iravan Khanate.THE RUSSIAN OCCUPATION AND THE RELOCATION OF ARMENIANS TO THE LANDS OF NORTH AZERBAIJAN T H E I R A В А Н K H A N A T E AZERBAIJAN NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES,A.A.BAKIKHANOV INSTITUTE OF HISTORY 110 Local copper coins called garapul (black coin – trans.)occupied a special position* in the khanate.In addition,the currency left from the former Safavid state (1501-1736),coins produced in other Azerbaijani khanates,as well as foreign currencies,were all used here [95,851,888-891].In the XVII-XVIII centuries,Iravan was among the biggest centres of minting in Azerbaijan.The mints of khans of Iravan were leased out.The coins minted by the renters were of superior quality to foreign coins [see:95,888-889; see:end of chapter,table 5].The presence of numerous watermills in the Iravan Khanate prove the extensive development of grain production in this area,while the presence of many oil factories proves the growth of vegetable oil production.According to data in one source,25 vegetable oil enterprises,340 watermills,85 dings (rice threshing machine-trans.)and 1 brickfield were operating in the Iravan province [see:71,IV,283-284].The Adiyaman,Qizilvang,Baligchay,Tokhluja,Ayrija,Zangi and other rivers of the Iravan Khanate flowing into Lake Göycha were abundant in fish [71,IV,283-284].Forms of land property.During the period of the khanates,no serious changes occurred in the traditional form of land property in the Iravan Khanate,or in the other Azerbaijani khanates.Land plots were divided into 5 groups,depending on the form of property:state-owned plots (divan)and palace plots (khalisa),estate plots,tiyul plots (granted for military or civil service – trans.),vagf (property of religious institutions – trans.)and community plots.State-owned plots.Original sources mention that state-owned plots were of two types:divan and khalisa.The plots,crops of which were divided amongst the khan’s officials,were named khalisa,while state-governed lands were called divan [171,14].The difference * General Velyaminov’s records,dated September 1825,provide information about the desire of Hassan khan Gajar,brother of the Iravan sardar,and Shahzadah Abbas Mirza to also raise Daghistani feudals against the Russian invaders.Hassan khan Gajar assigned this task to 3 men from the Garapapagli tribe and paid them 1000 Iravan rubles [see:58,60].THE RUSSIAN OCCUPATION AND THE RELOCATION OF ARMENIANS TO THE LANDS OF NORTH AZERBAIJAN T H E I R A В А Н K H A N A T E AZERBAIJAN NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES,A.A.BAKIKHANOV INSTITUTE OF HISTORY 111 between the divan and khalisa plots existing in the times of the Safavids gradually disappeared in the second half of the XVIII century and the plots of both categories were united under one name – the khan’s plots.All the harvest gathered from these lands was at the khan’s disposal.The khan had quite broad authority and the income resulting from divan plots was entirely under his control.The khans of Iravan tried to expand the khalisa and divan plots by all means [see:95,989-990; 160,part 1,page 102].Estate plots.Estate plots were personal property and could be bought and sold freely.As in the other Azerbaijani khanates,estate plots were inherited from generation to generation.Estate owners were not obliged to serve the khan [see:95,926-928].Original sources state that 3 forms of estates existed in Iravan:1)estates bringing income as immovable property.This included not only settlements,but also mills,dings,vineyards and orchards,as well as hamams (baths – trans.).Pastures were also considered to be personal property; 2)renta – a village paying 1/10th of the harvest as a tax; 3)peasant plots on which the 1/10th renta tax was levied [see:51,107,174,287; 174,222-248].In the Iravan Khanate,estate plots were divided into two main groups:inherited estates and estate khalisa,which originated in the bestowal of land.The inherited estates had ancient history,while estate khalisa emerged as a result of land bestowal or sale [see:160,part 1,page 122].According to different sources,the Üchkilsa Monastery acquired the right of ownership over 22 villages,partially purchase,and partially via bestowal at different times during the XVII-XVIII centuries [174,234].Tiyul plots.In the second half of the XVIII century,tiyul – a conditional form of property was widespread.Certain people were granted permanent tiyul as a reward for their position and military service.When the owner of tiyul completed his service or died,the 112 AZERBAIJAN NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES,A.A.BAKIKHANOV INSTITUTE OF HISTORY T H E I R A В А Н K H A N A T E THE RUSSIAN OCCUPATION AND THE RELOCATION OF ARMENIANS TO THE LANDS OF NORTH AZERBAIJAN bestowed villages were returned to the treasury [see:95,928-929; 160,part 1,page 124.In the late XVIII century,the right of tiyul was somewhat changed in the Azerbaijani khanates,as well as the Iravan Khanate.That is,if before the remainder of taxes was collected by the khan’s tax collectors,now the tiyul owners could collect not only the renta – a part of the taxes,but all of the taxes.Inhabitants of the villages bestowed as tiyul were completely dependent on the tiyul owner and were fulfilling all the duties for his benefit.A tiyul owner was usually living in the village and personally managing all the village activities [174,218-219].Vagf plots.Vagf plots were the plots permanently assigned to religious institutions – mosques,madrasas or churches at different times.Along with the vagf lands belonging to Azerbaijani mosques and other religious institutions located in the Iravan Khanate,other types of property belonging to religious institutions – houses,shops,caravanserais,mills,dings ,oil factories etc.could also be a vagf.Their servants were relieved of taxes.The vagf plots existing on the Iravan Khanate’s territories had been created in Azerbaijan as far back as the reign of the Arab Caliphate as plot property belonging to mosques,madrasas and religious institutions.However,after the relocation of the centre of the Armenian Catholicate to the Iravan (Chukhursad)region by permission of the Azerbaijani Garagoyunlu ruler Jahanshah in 1441,several Gregorian churches commenced their activity here along with many mosques.Pursuing a policy of tolerance and patronage towards the Gregorian church,Azerbaijani rulers were thereby creating favourable conditions for the development of an Armenian feudal economy in Azerbaijani lands [115,29].Historical facts prove clearly the bitter consequences of this faulty policy.The Armenian Catholicate,possessing not even a centimetre of land in the 113 AZERBAIJAN NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES,A.A.BAKIKHANOV INSTITUTE OF HISTORY T H E I R A В А Н K H A N A T E THE RUSSIAN OCCUPATION AND THE RELOCATION OF ARMENIANS TO THE LANDS OF NORTH AZERBAIJAN Azerbaijani state of Garagoyunlu after having been relocated from the city of Sis in Cilicia,was trying to acquire not only villages and large fertile plots,but also orchards and vineyards,eventually to deprive the real owners of these lands of their own property from 1443 [see:51; 72; 73].The Üchkilsa,which had become a large monastic economy by the early XVII century,intensified the further acquisition of the ancestral estates of Azerbaijani Turks.In the second half of the XVIII century,the monastery had 190 khalvars (around 375 hectares)of plots,obtained precisely by purchase of these ancestral estates,of which 103 khalvars were seeded and planted every year.As a result,the Üchkilsa monastery economy had enlarged and become a sort of state within a state by the XVIII century [115,29].In 1763,Catholicos Simeon had received cabala from Hüsseingulu khan for the Üchkilsa maaflig (plot relieved from taxes – trans.)[51,208].At that time,the Echmiadzin Church had at its disposal not only the village of Valarshabad,but also 7 other villages* – Oshagan,Ashtarak,Gamishlik,Aghunatun,Chichakli,Mughni and Kirajli – purchased from Azerbaijani Turks for cash.The church was receiving 1/10th of the general production of these villages [139,3].In the period of the khanates,just as in the XVII century,the Üchkilsa Monastery was either purchasing or acquiring by force plots belonging to Azerbaijani Turks.For example,in 1797,a major argument broke out between the local owners and the Armenian church economy over ownership of Azerbaijani land,namely the Qedar plot located near Oshagan village.G.Garnesi wrote the following to a representative of the Istanbul Catholicate,Galust vardapet,on December 24 of the same year,regarding this conflict:* Grigor Makulu,appointed as the Catholicos of Üchkilsa by the Azerbaijani Garagoyunlu ruler Jahanshah in 1443,succeeded in acquiring first Valarshabad and later the other villages,in parts,together with their estate plots via serious and repeated conflicts [see:end of chapter,section 2,table 1].THE

“Inhabitants of the neighbouring village of Qizil Teymur,originally from Mughan,want to get hold of the land property of a village named Qedar nearby Oshagan.On seeing the plot demolished,the son of Haji Hassan,the estate’s bey,goes to Sheikhülislam and informs him that the estate is a part of Mahammadabad village and that he inherited it from his ancestors.After this,he manages to sell the plot to Vali bey’s son Mahammad Hassan bey (or Mashadi Sadigh).Sheikhülislam grants him the cabala.However,the Catholicos obstructs the process.” [214,51].Using different tricks,the church tried to prove that the villages of Qizil Teymur,Qedar and others,which were native ancestral lands of Azerbaijanis,belonged to it and,eventually,the Armenians succeeded in invading the village of Qedar,which belonged to Azerbaijanis.Community or public plots.These plots belonged mainly to village communities [173,72; 115,28].I.Shopen reported that there were 8 communities in the Iravan Khanate.The villages belonging to the communities were owned by the subject class,which was a part of that community [see:95,967-980].The overwhelming majority of the communities were Azerbaijani Turks.Taxes and levies.In the khanate period,the numbers and amounts of taxes applied in the Iravan khanate differed,just like in the other khanates of Azerbaijan.These taxes were obtained mostly in the form of products and partially in the form of money.Usually,peasants paid taxes (landed gentry were relieved of taxes).The rural population consisted mainly of the following categories:raiyyat,ranjbar and elat [95,967; 115,30-31].The pastures in this region were controlled mainly by the Aghjali-Gajars,a Qizilbash tribe,as well as the Ustajlis and Bayats,from the XVII century [174,311].Detailed information regarding the taxes and levies applied in the Iravan Khanate can be obtained from the “List of Money and Product Taxes in the Iravan Province,” compiled by Russian tsarist officials in late 1828.These documents,published by N.G.Bogdanov in 1939,reflect the taxes and levies paid by the nomadic and semi-nomadic tribes in the Iravan Khanate [141,see:174,313-314].Bahra (maljahat)(crop tax – trans.),chopbashi,chobanbeyi,manjanag tax,weaver tax,orchard tax,bayramlig (holiday tax – trans.)and other taxes were the main taxes in the Iravan Khanate.Two different forms of industry existed in the Iravan Khanate,as well as in the other Azerbaijani khanates:settled farming and highland-lowland (or summer-winter)cattle-breeding.This also attracted the greater number of taxes levied on peasants.Bahra (maljahat).The main tax paid in the form of products for using a plot was Bahra (maljahat).This tax was called bahra (crop– trans.)in Iravan as it was paid in the form of crops [174,266].Bahra was obligatory for the subjected classes engaged in grain production.3.5 parts of every 10 parts of crops harvested from treasury plots belonged to the khan,while the remainder belonged to the peasants.On estate plots,1.5 parts of the crop belonged to the landlord,2 parts to the treasury and the remainder to the peasants [115,37].Chopbashi.Cattle-breeders paid this tax for pasturing their cattle on plots belonging to the state.They also paid the chobanbeyi tax.In addition,cattle-breeders were supposed to give the khan butter,wool and other products [115,38].The manjanag tax,weaver tax,orchard tax,bayramlig etc.were the taxes paid by the urban population [115,38].In addition to the above,the khanate’s population also paid pasture tax and smoke tax and covered the expenses of the cavalry (barley and saddle-related expenses).The khan’s own high-ranking officials were almost free of taxes.Aside from the taxes paid to landlords and the khan,the khanate’s population gave “peshkash” (gift – trans.)or “bayramlig” (holiday present – trans.)at various ceremonies and holidays [174,281].The population of Iravan paid a special tax amounting to 72 tümans per year for the city’s night security guard [95,978].116 AZERBAIJAN NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES,A.A.BAKIKHANOV INSTITUTE OF HISTORY T H E I R A В А Н K H A N A T E THE RUSSIAN OCCUPATION AND THE RELOCATION OF ARMENIANS TO THE LANDS OF NORTH AZERBAIJAN Armenians were not levied for a religious tax – jizya in the Iravan Khanate-as the number of Armenians on the khanate’s territory was insignificant and the jizya they might pay was of no economic interest to the state.On the other hand,Azerbaijani rulers traditionally patronised the Üchkilsa Catholicos and Armenians.It would be relevant to point out here that,after the Iravan Khanate was occupied by Russia,tsarist officials,showing great zeal,raised the issue of “relieving” Armenians “from taxes” the Armenians in the Iravan Khanate in gratitude for their “service”.That is,on 22nd March 1828,Duke Alexander Chavchavadze,governor of the newly-established,so-called “Armenian province”,created by decree of the Russian Emperor,wrote a letter to Nerses Ashtarakli asking for information as to whether Armenians had paid a special tax in the Iravan Khanate during the previous government’s reign in order to fulfill decree #458 of Paskevich,commander of the Special Corpse of Caucasus dated 17 March 1828.He demanded the cancellation of such a tax,in the event it existed [214,54].However,in his reply to the letter on 29th March 1828,Nerses Ashtarakli informed him that “Armenians were not levied any tax in the Iravan Khanate during the previous government because of their religious difference” [214,54].As mentioned above,this was connected with the insignificant number of Armenians living in the Khanate’s territory before the Russian invasion.Thus the khans of Iravan considered such a tax unnecessary.The low number of Armenians in the Iravan Khanate is confirmed by another tax-related fact:original sources do not contain any records mentioning Armenians among the categories of population paying taxes to the state and landowners.According to I.Shopen,Armenians living in the surrounding five districts were paying only 680 tümans in tax for producing wine [95,975].Levies were of two types:biyar and avariz (imajilik-collective unpaid work-trans.).The plots owned by landowners were sown and 117 AZERBAIJAN NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES,A.A.BAKIKHANOV INSTITUTE OF HISTORY T H E I R A В А Н K H A N A T E THE RUSSIAN OCCUPATION AND THE RELOCATION OF ARMENIANS TO THE LANDS OF NORTH AZERBAIJAN THE RUSSIAN OCCUPATION AND THE RELOCATION OF ARMENIANS TO THE LANDS OF NORTH AZERBAIJAN T H E I R A В А Н K H A N A T E AZERBAIJAN NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES,A.A.BAKIKHANOV INSTITUTE OF HISTORY 118 planted by village communities.Biyar was 3-6 days per year of unpaid labour by every family on landlord plots.In addition,members of communities had to work 2 days per year for the landowners as avariz (imajilik)[174,278-279].According to A.Araratli,during the sowing season,people from Valarshabad (Vagharshabad)village were taken to the landowner’s plots and made to work day and night with the exception of w eek-ends [53,183].The interesting point is that A.Araratli does not mention a single Armenian name among the peasants of Valarshabad.Thus,the population of this region consisted solely of Azerbaijanis.The plots of Üchkilsa were free of any taxes,being considered vagf plots.Proprietors of these plots even received maaf rights for various services.All the names of taxes and all the economic terms mentioned in original sources from the XVIII century reveal that the general socio-economic picture of the Iravan Khanate was similar to that of all the rest of the Azerbaijani khanates.Or rather,it was a continuation of Azerbaijan’s earlier traditional historical development.Table 1.Names of squares in the city of Iravan,registered after the Russian occupation 119 AZERBAIJAN NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES,A.A.BAKIKHANOV INSTITUTE

and the system of governance of the khanate 4 Historical-geographical borders.One of the independent states established in the historical Azerbaijanilands,the Iravan Khanate covered south-western areas of North Azerbaijan and was located on both banks of the River Araz in the first half of the XVIII century.There are different information about the Khanate’s historical-geograpical borders.N.Dubrovin has provided information about the borders of the Iravan Khanate,albeit briefly.He notes that the khanate bordered on the Pambak,Shamsaddil and Gazakh sultanates,as well as the Ganja Khanate in the north,the Garabagh and Nakhchivan Khanates in the east and the territories of Iran and the Ottoman Empire in the south and the west [149,327].S.D.Burnashev fairly points out that the political and geographical borders of Azerbaijani khanates were constantly changing* due to the incessant wars [40,25-26].However,while describing the borders of the Iravan Khanate with neighbouring states,the author wrongly indicates that the khanate was located only on the left bank of the River Araz [40,17].Records contained in various sources show that the Iravan Khanate was located mostly on the left and partly on the right bank of the River Araz** [95,351-353; 149,327; 71,V,253; see:end of chapter,maps 3,4].Positioned between longitude 61°-64° East and latitude 41°-39° North and enclosing the fertile Araz Valley,the Iravan Khanate bordered on the Pambak,Shamsaddil and Gazakh sultanates in the north,Ganja in the north-east,the Garabagh and Nakhchivan Khanates in the east,the Khoy and Maku Khanates,as well as the Bayazid Pashalig in the south and,finally,the Kaghizman and Kars Pashaligs in the west.The overall * The areas of Shöreyel and Pambak were taken from the khanate and given to the Kartli-Kakheti Tsardom as a sultanate by the Russian Empire [71,I,294].** The fact that the Iravan Khanate’s territories were located on both banks of the River Araz is evident even from maps compiled after its invasion by the Russian Empire [see:maps 1,2,3].T H E I R A В А Н K H A N A T E THE RUSSIAN OCCUPATION AND THE RELOCATION OF ARMENIANS TO THE LANDS OF NORTH AZERBAIJAN AZERBAIJAN NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES,A.A.BAKIKHANOV INSTITUTE OF HISTORY 141 territory of Iravan Khanate covered 11000 square versts* [see:71,IV,253; 106,34].The khanate’s political and geographical borders,starting from the River Arpachay in the west and the vicinity of the Qizilkilsa village in the north,extended towards the south,then turned slightly eastwards,to the village of Haji Bayramli on the lower reaches of the River Arpachay; they extended to the Garibdagh Range in the west,passing the River Araz and reaching into the north-western part of the Garibdagh Range as far as the Koroghlu Mountain.From here,the enclosed territories stretched firstly to the north-east and then slightly northwards,to the meeting of the Lower Aghri and,to the north-west – the River Araz [see:end of chapter,pic.12].Crossing the Araz boundary here,the territories extended along the mountain range separating Nakhchivan from the Sharur Plain and included Lake Göycha,together with the mountains on its east along the northern strip between the Zangazour Mountains and the Gözaldara mountain range.Then the Khanate’s territories passed Bazarlig village along a line connecting the Pambak Mountains and northern slope of Alagöz,reaching the village of Qizilkilsa** [95,351-352; 214,31-32].During Hüsseinali Khan’s reign (1762***-1783),the borders of the Iravan Khanate expanded further,covering also the district of Shöreyel [214,31-32].Referring to Melikset bey’s “Georgian sources”,A.R.Grigoryan wrote:“in 1779,the Georgian Duke Irakli II attacked the Iravan Khanate,invaded Shöreyel and subdued its ruler Sultan Gahraman”.After this invasion,the liberation of Shöreyel and its return to Iravan was constantly the khanate’s focus of attention of its foreign policy [105,178; 214,32].** This description is by Dimity Zubarev [see:71,IV,253].** All the names of places,the toponyms presented in every record describing the Iravan Khanate’s territories and borders are given in Azerbaijani Turkish,more precisely,those names and settlements belong to the Azerbaijani nation.The “Jambr”,considered to be an Armenian source,contains hundreds of such toponyms [see:chapter 2,Annex #4].Even the Armenian author V.A.Grigoryan presented the majority of toponyms in his book firstly in Azerbaijani Turkish and then,in brackets,their Armenianised version taken from the Persian language.Eg.:Arpachay (Akhuryan),Gözaldara (Vardenis)etc.[214,31-32,etc.].*** Hüsseinali khan Gajar of Iravan’s accession to power is recorded in the “Jambr”,a source contemporary with events in 1759-1760 [105,137].T H E I R A В А Н K H A N A T E THE RUSSIAN OCCUPATION AND THE RELOCATION OF ARMENIANS TO THE LANDS OF NORTH AZERBAIJAN AZERBAIJAN NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES,A.A.BAKIKHANOV

INSTITUTE OF HISTORY 143 In 1795,Agha Mahammad khan Gajar imposed his rule on the Iravan Khanate.He then issued a special order giving Pambak,Gazakh and Borchali to Mahammad khan of Iravan [149,65].However,soon – in 1796-Russian troops headed by V.Zubov attacked Azerbaijan.Agha Mahammad khan Gajar was forced to retreat to Iran.Thus Mahammad khan of Iravan was not able to hold onto the Azerbaijani lands-Pambak,Gazakh and Borchali-given to him by Agha Mahammad khan Gajar during his rule.In the spring of 1797,Agha Mahammad shah Gajar launched his second attack on Azerbaijan,returned Pambak and Borchali to the Khan of Iravan and demanded that Irakli give Shamsaddil and Gazakh to Javad khan [149,207; 214,33].Agha Mahammad khan Gajar’s assassination in July of the same year prevented implementation of this plan.On the contrary,Mahammad khan of Iravan was arrested and taken to Iran.Following his return from Iran,at the beginning of 1801,Shöreyel was invaded.Shöreyel remained a part of the Iravan Khanate until its occupation by Russia in the spring of 1805.Administrative territorial division.Like the other khanates of Azerbaijan,the Iravan Khanate was also divided into mahals and the mahals were divided into villages [see:end of chapter,map 3].The city of Iravan bordered on Qirkhbulag Mahal in the north,Zangibassar Mahal in the west and south,and the rocky steps of Okhchuberd Mountain in the east,separating it from Garbibassar (Korpübassar)Mahal.The city of Iravan,together with the gardens surrounding it,extended over a vast territory.It covered an area of 28 versts [95,463-464; see:end of chapter,pic.5,6,7,8,11].It was the capital of the Iravan Khanate,an independent administrative centre,and was divided into two parts – the Inner City (fortress)and the Outer City [see:end of chapter,maps 2,4].The Inner City was mostly comprised of the Iravan Fortress.It was built by the Ottoman warlord Farhad Pasha in 1583,but was destroyed and restored many times,substantially reinforced in the late XVIII century and it withstood countless determined sieges.The Iravan Fortress was situated on the left bank of the River Zangi.The fortress was surrounded by a deep ditch on three sides and 2 high walls,built on the left bank of the River Zangi,on the fourth side.The fortress had two gates:the famous Shirvan Gate in the north and the Tabriz Gate in the south.The fortress also had an exit to the River Zangi,intended for use during sieges [71,IV,290; 200,41].Having visited the place in 1813,Gaspar Druvil wrote:“The Iravan Fortress is surrounded by two walls and located half a cannon’s range from the city.The fortress has caused long-lasting arguments between Turkey and Iran and eventually remained under the Safavid control.The fortress is managed by a khan.The khan keeps three regular detachments,60 cannons and half of the cavalry artillery squadron inside the fortress [49,8]”.The warlord’s palace,military barracks,shops and two mosques were inside the fortress.* 2 underground water canals – one from the River Zangi and the other from the southeast,the River Qirkhbulag,provided the fortress with water [see:end of chapter,pic.3,4].There were 800 houses in the Iravan Fortress before the Russian invasion.However,most of these houses were destroyed after the occupation [71,IV,290].The Outer City mainly consisted of three large quarters.Those quarters were the following:Shahri (Old City)Quarter – covered the city’s north-eastern part and extended to the Iravan Fortress along the right bank of the River Qirkhbulag.The central bazaar and all the city’s squares,as well as many *The mosques recorded in Iravan city are described in the table at the end of the chapter [see:table 2; pic.1,2,15].T H E I R A В А Н K H A N A T E

situated here [95,464; 200,46; see:end of chapter,table 3; pic.9,10,14].Tapabashi Quarter – was located on the hills between the River Zangi and the Shahri Quarter.This quarter covered the city’s western area.The Tapabashi Quarter was separated from the Shahri Quarter by lots of gardens belonging to the rich people of Iravan.The famous Khan Garden,owned by Hüsseingulu Khan,was also situated here [95,464-465; 200,46].Damirbulag Quarter – was located south-east of the Shahri Quarter,on the eastern side of the Iravan Fortress.The Jafar Bey Mosque and Bath,as well as the Hassanali Bath and the Susuz Caravanserai were situated here [95,465; 214,40; 200,47].The inhabitants of the two above-mentioned quarters were Azerbaijani Turks [200,47].Ibrahim Rahimzadeh,who was the Sultan’s Clerk during the Ottoman assaults in the XVI century,called the city of Iravan “the eye of the Azerbaijani estate” [9,169].Despite its occupation by Russia in the first half of the XIX century,the city of Iravan maintained its beauty and inherent Azerbaijani Turkishness even in later periods.B.Jelikhovskaya wrote about it in this way:“Iravan is a purely Tatar (Azerbaijani-editor)city in its outer appearance,it looks very nice from afar.The plain on which the city is situated looks like a huge flower basket.White houses,towers,the ruins of the fortress,the mosques covered with colourful tiles and their glorious minarets are all lost among gardens,surrounded by an alley of conical cypresses; everything is embraced by vine branches and carpets of ivy and decorated with rose and pomegranate bushes.The River Zangi falls downhill from the high mountain onto the plain like a waterfall,creating deep inlays in the rocks,flowing towards the city and losing itself in the jungles of every kind of green” [154,40-42].According to a source written by Legkobitov in 1836,there were 1736 houses,5 squares,8 mosques,5 churches* ,6 caravanserais,1670 shops,9 public baths,1470 vineyards and orchards,40 mills and 6 dings were based around Iravan city,in the Outer City area [71,IV,291].In contrast to Legkobitov,I.Shopen notes there were 1730 houses in the city of Iravan.792 of them located in Shahri (Old City),622 in Tapabashi and 322 in the Damirbulag quarters [95,468].The Sardarabad Fortress was not only the second biggest fortress-city after the Iravan Fortress,but also among the most magnificent Azerbaijani fortifications of the Middle Ages.According to I.Shopen,the Fortress’ foundation was laid by Hüssein khan of Iravan (Hüsseingulu khan Gajar – editor)in roughly 1810 [95,255].The tall double walls of the Sardarabad Fortress,located on the left bank of the River Araz,were in an elongated rectangular form.The long (side)walls had 6 towers for cannons and the short walls contained 4.The fortress,surrounded by a deep ditch,had a circumference of approximately 4 versts.In addition to the warlord’s palace,700 houses,1 mosque,33 shops,16 mills,1 ding,4 dairies,1 dyeing house and the warlord’s large garden were located here.The population was engaged in husbandry,cattle-breeding,small-scale trade,calico weaving,blacksmithing,tailoring and other crafts [71,IV,291-292].According to other sources,the Sardarabad Fortress was surrounded by adobe walls with a circular tower.The former Sardarabad village was located in the fortress [59,28].The Sardarabad Fortress was enclosed by double walls on three sides,only the southern side had a single wall [32,564].The khanate was divided administratively into mahals [see:95,442-446; 50,31].The mahals were governed by mahal beys or naibs.The position of a mahal bey or naib was hereditary.However,each one was approved by the khan.A naib was also responsible for his mahal’s administrative,defence and,sometimes,judiciary.*The mosques recorded in Iravan city are described in the table at the end of the chapter [see:table 2; pic.1,2,15].T H E I R A В А Н K H A N A T E THE RUSSIAN OCCUPATION AND

people working in the khanate’s administrative structure received almost no monthly salary.Their remuneration for services came from taxes collected for the treasury.The territory of the Iravan Khanate was divided into 12 mahals in earlier times.Later,Hüsseingulu khan Gajar established 3 more new mahals,bringing their number to 15 [200,33].The availability of the khanate’s irrigation system for all mahals was taken into consideration during the division into mahals.This was of essential importance for the development of agriculture on the khanate’s territories.The Iravan Khanate consisted of the following mahals[see:end of chapter,table 2]:Qirkhbulag Mahal.This mahal covered the northern and southern parts of Iravan city.It bordered on the River Araz to the south and Darachichak to the north,Garnibassar to the west and the Garni-Vedibassar mahals to the east.The mahal is referred to as the separate mahals of Qirkhbulag and Zangibassar by the late XVIII century.The list of estates belonging to Mahammad Hüssein khan Gajar of Iravan shows that most of the villages belonging to Zangibassar Mahal were mentioned as being part of Qirkhbulag Mahal [214,33].A source contemporary with the first quarter of the XIX century already presents Qirkhbulag Mahal using two names:Qirkhbulag Mahal and Zangibassar Mahal [95,442].I.Shopen noted 48 villages belonging to Qirkhbulag Mahal,pointing out that 26 of them had already been destroyed [see:95,509-510; 543-544].Referring precisely to this source,G.Bournoutian declares the existence of 22 villages in this mahal,with Kanakir being its centre [200,38].Zangibassar Mahal,which was a part of Qirkhbulag in the XVIII century,was completely separate from the latter by the early XIX centu-ry.I.Shopen reported the existence of 33 villages in Zangibassar Mahal,noting that 7 of them had already been destroyed [see:95,510,547-548].Hence G.Bournoutian’s records stating that Zangibassar Mahal covered 26 villages,including its centre,the village of Ulukhanli [200,35].Garni-Vedibassar Mahal.According to the list of documents kept in Matenadaran,this mahal was combined at the time,covering lands irrigated from the River Azad (Garnichay),stretching northwards from the River Araz,as well as the valleys irrigated from the Vedichay and Gapanchay basin.It bordered on Göycha in the north and Sharur in the east [214,34].The mahal was later divided into two parts – the Garnibassar and Vedibassar* mahals [95,442-443].Situated on the left bank of the River Araz,Garnibassar Mahal bordered on Qirkhbulag in the north,Zangibassar in the west,partially the River Araz and Vedibassar Mahal in the south,with high mountains separating it from Göycha Mahal in the east.I.Shopen noted 95 villages in Garnibassar Mahal,pointing out that 43 of them had already been destroyed [see:95,442,510-511,547-555].G.Bournoutian reports that Garnibassar Mahal had 52 villages,including its centre,Gamarli village,ignoring the destroyed villages.The River Garni flowing through the area provided the entire mahal with water [200,35].Vedibassar Mahal,located on the left bank of the River Araz,bordered on Garnibassar Mahal in the north,the Araz River in the west,Sharur Mahal and the Nakhchivan Khanate in the south and south-east and Göycha Mahal in the east.The rivers Vedichay and Gapan provided the mahal with water [95,442-443].I.Shopen reported the existence of 54 villages in Vedibassar Mahal,noting that 33 of them had already been destroyed [95,511-512,555-556].Accordingly,G.Bournoutian reports the existence of 21 villages in Vedibassar Mahal including its centre,Davali village [200,35].* The toponym Vedibassar is concocted from two components – “vedi” meaning “valley” in Arabic and “basar” – deriving from the verb ‘basmag” (flood arising from a river overflow)in Azerbaijani Turkish.A small river named Vedi is known to have existed in the Iravan region [171,50].In addition,there was a village in the Iravan region named Böyük Vedi (Large Vedi –trans.).A Russian source refers to the village in Arabic – as Vedi Ulya [95,537].The village’s aboriginal inhabitants – Azerbaijani Turks-were forcibly driven out of the area in 1918 and the Armenians arriving from Turkey in 1915-1918 were relocated here [see:110,162,169-170].T H E I R A В А Н K H A N A T E THE RUSSIAN OCCUPATION

parts by the River Arpachay [95,443].According to I.Shopen’s census,11 of the 61 villages belonging to this mahal had been completely destroyed [95,512,555-563].According to G.Bournoutian,this mahal controlled only 50 villages,including its centre,Angicha village.The River Arpachay provided the mahal’s entire irrigation system [200,35].Sürmali Mahal.This mahal,covering the south-western areas of the Iravan Khanate,was situated on the right bank of the River Araz.It bordered on the River Araz in the north and north-east,Darakand-Parchenis Mahal in the west and the Aghridagh Range separated it from the Bayazid Pashalig in the south.The mahal’s main irrigation sources were the canals taking their water from the River Araz.According to I.Shopen’s description,28 of the mahal’s 78 villages had been complete-ly destroyed [95,443,512-513,563-567].Sürmali was the most densely populated district of the Iravan Khanate.Its population was mostly engaged in cattle-breeding.G.Bournoutian states that the mahal had 49 villages together with its centre,Ighdir [200,35].However,I.Shopen reports 50 undamaged villages [see:95,563-567].Darakand-Parcheniz Mahal was established by Hüsseinali khan Gajar,by separating it from Sürmali Mahal.The mahal was located at the khanate’s south-western end,on the right bank of the River Araz.Darakand-Parcheniz Mahal bordered on Saadli Mahal in the north,the Ottoman State in the south-west and Sürmali Mahal in the east.The new mahal covered the Parcheniz,Darakand and Parnaud valleys stretching from the Bayazid borders to the River Araz.Besides the 8 destroyed villages,26 inhabitable villages were mentioned as existing in the Parcheniz Valley and 54 in the Darakand Valley [95,443,513,571-574].The famous village of Goghb (Gulp)and a salt refinery of the same name were situated here.The village had already become the mahal’s centre [200,35-36].Saadli Mahal.* Considered to be the smallest mahal of the Iravan Khanate,Saadli Mahal was situated at the Khanate’s western end.The River Arpachay,flowing into the River Araz,separated the mahal into two parts.Saadli Mahal bordered on Talin in the north,the Ottoman State in the west,Darakand-Parcheniz in the south and Sardarabad Mahal in the east.I.Shopen mentioned 14 villages belonging to Saadli Mahal,noting that 5 of them had already been destroyed [95,444,513,575-576].Thus G.Bournoutian informs us that Saadli Mahal,inhabited mostly by the Saadli tribe,had only 9 villages,with its centre Kheyirbeyli [200,36].Talin Mahal.This was situated in the north-west of Iravan province,between Alagöz Mountain and the River Arpachay.This mahal bordered on Shöreyel in the north,the River Arpachay separating it from the Kars Pashalig in the west,the Sardarabad and Saadli mahals in the south and Seyidli-Akhsakhli Mahal in the east.I.Shopen listed 47 villages belonging to the Talin Mahal,noting that over 27 of them had already been destroyed [95,444,513-514,575-576].G.Bournoutian states that Talin Mahal was not densely populated and had 20 inhabitable villages.The trade road passing through the mahal centre,Talin,led to the Black Sea and Russia via Tiflis [200,36].The famous Talin Caravanserai was based here [see:pic.9].Seyidli-Akhsakhli Mahal.** This mahal,taking its name from two tribes,covered the territories starting from Talin Mahal’s borders to * “Saadli” is the name of an ancient Turkish tribe.There are tens of settlements in Azerbaijan,Turkey and Georgia named Saadli.All of these settlements are memorials to the Turkish tribe called Saadli.A source contemporary with the XVII century calls it the Country of Saad [134,90,193,485,etc.].** The first part of the name of Seyidli-Akhsakhli Mahal – the word “Seyidli”-is related to the name of the ancient Saadli tribe.Even the western historian of Armenian origin,G.Bournoutian noted its name as Saidli in his book [200,36].The word “Akhsakhli” in the second part of the mahal’s name is not used in the meaning of “akhsag” (lame – trans.).It is related to the name of an ancient tribe called Sak,whose traces still remain in the names of other settlements and toponyms in Azerbaijan and which was formerly pronounced as “Aghsakli”.For example,Shaki – Saki,Zakatala – Sak talasi (The Sak Field – trans.),Akhsakhli – Agh Sakli,Arsak (Arsak)– er Sak,etc.In addition,the word may also be connected to the name of an ancient Gajar tribe – Akhjali-Aghajari.Different sources confirm that the Iravan region was the motherland of the Aghjagoyunlu Gajars from ancient times.T H E I R A В А Н K H A N A T E THE

eastern slopes of Alagöz Mountain.It bordered on Abaran Mahal in the north,Talin Mahal in the west,a small part of Sardarabad Mahal in the south-west and Garbibassar Mahal in the south-west [95,444].The district had only 20 villages,with its centre at Ushi (Üshü).Of these,11 villages belonged to the Seyidli tribe and 9 to the Akhsakhli.There is no mention of destroyed villages here [95,575-580; 200,36].Sardarabad Mahal.This was one of the largest of the Iravan Khanate’s mahals.Sardarabad Mahal was located on the north bank of the River Araz,before Sürmali Mahal.It bordered on Talin in the north,Saadli in the west,the River Araz dividing it from Sürmali Mahal in the south and the Zangibassar and Garbibassar Mahals in the east.By 1810,the famous Sardarabad Fortress had been built by decree of Hüsseingulu khan Gajar of Iravan in this mahal,which,itself,had also been established to his order.Hüsseingulu khan Gajar lived there [95,255].30 villages were listed in this mahal,with Sardarabad city as its centre.8 of them had been destroyed.It is worth noting that the Armenians who lived in this mahal later were relocated there mostly from the Bayazid Pashalig following the Russian invasion [95,444,514,579-584].Garbibassar (Korpübassar)Mahal.This mahal bordered on Seyidli-Akhsakhli Mahal in the north,Sardarabad in the west,Zangibassar in the south,the River Zangi separating it from Qirkhbulag Mahal in the east and,partially,Darachichak Mahal in the north-east.All the lands irrigated from the River Garni lay within this mahal.49 villages were noted in Garbibassar Mahal.9 of them had been destroyed [95,445,514,583-588].Branches of the Abaran-su,Garbi and Araz rivers were the water-sources for Garbibassar Mahal,with its centre being Ashtarak.According to G.Bournoutian,the khanate’s centre,Iravan city and the religious centre of the Armenian Catholicate,Üchkilsa,were situated in this mahal [200,37].However,various other sources present the city of Iravan as an independent administrative area [see:end of chapter,maps 1,3].Abaran Mahal.* Situated at the northern end of the Iravan Khanate,Abaran Mahal covered the lands stretching north and north-east from the Great Alagöz Mountains and the areas between the Alagöz and Pambak Mountains.Enclosing the highlands,the mahal was located on the bank of the River Abaran-su.Abaran Mahal bordered on Pambak in the north,Shöreyel in the north-west,Seyidli-Akhsakhli in the south and Darachichak Mahal in the east.I.Shopen notes the destruction of 22 out of 61 villages belonging to Abaran Mahal [95,445,514-515,587-591].The mahal’s permanent population was quite low.As this mahal was located on the Georgian border,it staged military operations against invaders time after time.The Great Chobangara tribe lived in 39 villages of this mahal.Its centre was Bash Abaran [200,37].Darachichak Mahal.Darachichak Mahal stood out from the others for its beautiful climate.This mahal consisted of a valley stretching from Lake Göycha to Alapars village,along the outlet of the Rivers Zangi and Misgansu**.Darachichak Mahal bordered on Pambak in the north,Abaran in the west,Qirkhbulag in the south and the lands located west of Lake Göycha in the east.I.Shopen writes of the destruction of 16 of the 53 vilages existing here [95,445,515-516,591-596].This mahal,with its mild climate,was a rest place for officials of the Iravan Khanate.Darachichak and Bijni were the centres of Darachichak Mahal,encompassing 37 villages.The Misgansu and Zangi rivers provided this mahal with water [200,37].* Abaran,Aparan or Avaran – all three toponyms are in Azerbaijani Turkish.The version Abaran is the most ancient one and belongs to all Turkic languages.A river named the Abaran is known to have existed in the Kuban province of the North Caucasus [see:171,1].Abaran is the name of an ancient Turkish tribe.There were also Bash Abaran village and the River Abaran-su in the Iravan Khanate.The word Avaran is connected to the Avars who were derived from the Huns of the early Middle Ages [see:110,96-97].** The name of the River Misgansu is presented as the Miskhana in a Russian source of the XIX century [see:95,445].T H E I R A В А Н K H A N A T E THE RUSSIAN OCCUPATION AND THE RELOCATION OF ARMENIANS TO THE LANDS OF NORTH AZERBAIJAN AZERBAIJAN NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES,A.A.BAKIKHANOV INSTITUTE OF HISTORY 152 Göycha Mahal.* Göycha was the largest mahal in the north-eastern part of the Iravan Khanate.This mahal covered most of the Azerbaijani lands in the Lake Göycha basin (western areas were part of Darachichak Mahal – editor).The mahal bordered on the Shamshaddil Sultanate and the Ganja Khanate in the north,Darachichak Mahal in the north-west,the Qirkhbulag and Garnibassar mahals in the west,Vedibassar Mahal in the south-west,the Nakhchivan Khanate in the south and the Garabagh Khanate in the east.Despite its vast area,the mahal had a small population,as it was a battlefield in many wars.I.Shopen listed 126 vil-lages belonging to Göycha Mahal,noting that 67 of them had been destroyed and their names were mostly forgotten.Only 59 villages were populated [95,446,515-517,595-600].The district’s population was mostly engaged in cattle-breeding and its centre was Kavar** [200,37].Every mahal was a separate administrative unit.The mahals were governed by mahal beys or naibs appointed from the landowners.As mentioned above,although this was a hereditary position,each had to be approved by the khan.The Khans of Iravan usually appointed the mahal beys for an indefinite period.However,the latter turned the mahals they controlled into their personal estates,taking advantage of a favourable opportunity,or a weakening of the central government [50,81; 214,35].The mahal beys were mainly assigned to perform administrative and policing tasks.They supervised keeping law in the mahals and road maintenance.They resolved disputes and conflicts occurring in the villages under their command and made apropriate decisions.Furthermore,the mahal beys were entitled to render judicial verdicts on minor infringements [50,82; 214,35-36].* Göycha,Lake Göycha – The name of the Lake Göycha was changed by Armenians to “Sevan” in 1930,after the establishment of an Armenian state in Garbibassar-on the territories of the former Iravan Khanate.** Although G.Bournoutian,just like other Armenian researchers,falsifies the toponym “Kavar’ and identifies it with the word “Avan” (town),he fails to hide the fact that the Armenians relocated from Bayazid were settled in this village in 1829 and that it was called Nor Bayazid [200,37-38].T H E I R A В А Н K H A N A T E THE

RUSSIAN OCCUPATION AND THE RELOCATION OF ARMENIANS TO THE LANDS OF NORTH AZERBAIJAN AZERBAIJAN NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES,A.A.BAKIKHANOV INSTITUTE OF HISTORY 154 Most of the khanate’s villages were destroyed in wars conducted by the Georgian Duke Irakli II against the Iravan Khanate.By I.Shopen’s calculations,310 of a 831 villages existing in the Iravan Khanate in the first quarter of the XIX century were plundered,and abandoned by their inhabitants [95,510-517].The judiciary system was of special importance in the governance of the Iravan Khanate.The Sharia Court played the main role here.In addition,the khan himself had exceptional judiciary rights.The mahal beys and naibs performed some judicial functions.All civil and criminal cases were considered either by the Khan Court or the Sharia Court.Criminals were judged according to the principles or hadises of the “Koran”.Most small conflicts were resolved by a community jury.The community courts,consisting of the village elders,acted in accordance with local traditions and tried to reconcile the disputants.A party dissatisfied with the decision of the community jury could turn to the mahal judge.The latter’s verdict was final [50,82].The System of governance.The system of governance was based on monarchic principles in the Iravan Khanate,as in the rest of the Azerbaijani khanates.The khanate was headed by the khan with unlimited powers.All the powers – legislative,executive and judicial,were combined under the khan’s control [see:end of chapter,pic.13].The khan controlled all of the country’s administrative,military and legal systems of governance.He had the right to make decisions personally about the most important issues concerning the country’s destiny.The khan was also entitled to judge,impose penalties and make decisions about physical punishment or even impose a death sentence.And the sentence was immediately carried out.The system of governance in the Iravan Khanate was almost the same as in the rest of the Azerbaijani khanates.That is,a divan (court – trans.)or a Khan Council also operated under the Khan of Iravan.Members of the divan and the Khan Council were persons holding important government positions [95,451].Both bodies had advisory roles.The palace nobility had a special role in the governance of the Iravan Khanate.The vizier had extensive powers.Besides the vizier,there were also the sarkaralis (responsible for financial issues),eshikaghasi (managing the khan’s personal estate),sandig aghasi (treasurer),anbar aghasi (chief of the storage-trans),galabeyi (chief of the fortress-trans),mühasib bey (accountant bey-trans.)and other positions* in the khan’s palace.Military matters were led personally by the khan himself [214,38].The basic elements of financial activity were the establishment of a monetary system,its regulation and the collection of taxes.Naibs,yasovuls,kandkhudas and sarkars,appointed especially by the khan,played the main roles in this field.Darghas were engaged in the collection of taxes paid in the form of crops.The guard service ensured timely implementation of the khan’s instructions and played a vital role in keeping law and order in the country.The army was the main support for the khan’s power.Most of the troops were irregulars,consisting of maafs and elats.In addition,like the other Azerbaijani khanates,the Iravan Khanate also had a permanent military force.In time of war,the permanent troop was augmented by local armed forces.There are different records concerning the troops of the Iravan Khanate.Sources inform us that during military operations the Iravan Khanate was capable of bringing 2000 soldiers to the battlefield [69,122,127].A Russian colonel,S.Burnashev,who was very familiar with the Iravan Khanate’s military capabilities,wrote that the khan was able to deliver 5000 soldiers to the battlefield [214,38-39].* Interestingly,an Armenian author,A.R.Grigoryan,did not translate the names of all these positions in the governmental structure of the Iravan Khanate into Armenian and presented them in their origi-nal form,in the Azerbaijani language.T H E I R A В А Н K H A N A T E THE RUSSIAN OCCUPATION AND THE RELOCATION OF ARMENIANS TO THE LANDS OF NORTH AZERBAIJAN AZERBAIJAN NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES,A.A.BAKIKHANOV INSTITUTE OF HISTORY 155 In the second half of the XVIII century,the city of Iravan was one of the biggest cities and cultural centres of Azerbaijan.The khan lived there,together with his family and his servants.Iravan city was governed by a kalantar and a galabeyi appointed by the khan.Yasovuls,onbashis and farrashs were their subordinates.Thus,the system of governance in the Iravan Khanate,just as in the other Azerbaijani khanates,served entirely to protect the khan’s infinite powers and obey his will unconditionally.156 AZERBAIJAN NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES,A.A.BAKIKHANOV INSTITUTE OF HISTORY THE RUSSIAN OCCUPATION

[see:110,292].From 1829,after the relocation of Armenians from the Bayazid area of the Ottoman Empire there,it was replaced by the place name Nor Bayazid (then,from 1850,Novo Bayazid).In 1959 it was completely changed by the Armenians and was called Kamo.Centre of mahals Kanakir Ulukhanli Gamarli Davali Angija Ighdir Goghb (Gulp)Kheyribeyli Talin Ushi (Üshü)Sardarabad Ashtarak Bash Abaran

T E AZERBAIJAN NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES,A.A.BAKIKHANOV INSTITUTE OF HISTORY Culture 5 Despite the destructive wars occurring at short intervals,scienceand culture always progressed within the Iravan Khanate,especially in the city of Iravan,which was the Khanate’s centre.Hundreds of cultural artefacts,architectural monuments and artistic relics having been consigned to history – mosques,tombs,inscribed monuments,ram statues,as well as samples of illustrative and decorative applied arts existed on the territory of the Iravan Khanate.Hundreds of manuscripts stored in the Iravan Institute of Manuscripts – in Matenadaran-are from the period of the Iravan Khanate.Information about the cultural artefacts and architectural monuments located in the lands of the Iravan Khanate,its ancient culture and art,as well as the education system of the time,can be found in the books written by the French travellers Jean Tavernier and Jean Chardin,as well as by I.Shopen after the devastation caused by Russia,and also by the English explorer H.Lynch.All of the cultural artefacts on the Iravan Khanate’s territory,a land of pure Turks-Azerbaijanis until the beginning of the XIX century,have been savagely destroyed and obliterated by the Armenians,who were massively relocated to the Iravan Khanate’s territories from the beginning of the XIX century [see:end of chapter,pic.35,36,37,38,39,40].Nevertheless,original sources provide an opportunity to obtain sufficient information about these artefacts,as well as the art,education and literary environment once existing in the Iravan Khanate.Science and Education.The most detailed information about the education system in the Iravan Khanate can be obtained from the book “Historic Memory of the Period when the Armenian Province was Annexed to Russia”,authored by Russian historian and statistician I.Shopen,who conducted an in-house census of the territory after the Khanate’s occupation by Russia.The book shows that the education system in the Iravan Khanate was identical to the one applied in other khanates of Azerbaijan [95,901-911].187 AZERBAIJAN NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES,A.A.BAKIKHANOV INSTITUTE OF HISTORY T H E I R A В А Н K H A N A T E THE RUSSIAN OCCUPATION AND THE RELOCATION OF ARMENIANS TO THE LANDS OF NORTH AZERBAIJAN According to I.Shopen’s records,it was mainly religious figures who were involved in education in the Iravan Khanate.Every mosque had either a big or a small madrasa operating under it.The teachers of primary classes were called müdarris,while the teachers of advanced classes were called vaiz.Besides large classrooms,madrasas also had smaller rooms – hujras,where the students would sleep.Renowned mujtahids taught in some madrasas and people from all over the country would arrive to listen to them.On the eve of the Iravan Khanate’s decline,the number of pupils receiving education in the city of Iravan alone was 200 [95,901-911].I.Shopen writes that Moslem scholars divided all the sciences into three main categories:Al-Arabiat,Al-Sharua and Al-Hakima.The first category included mainly the rules of the Arabic language,history and reading the “Qur’an” (“Koran”).The second category covered interpre-tation of the “Qur’an” and studying the events and foundations of reli-gious law.The third category consisted of logic,mathematics,geometry and astronomy,medicine and theoretical philosophy.Most young people in Iravan would recite poems by the great poets of the East-Nizami,Rudaki,Firdovsi,Jami,Hafiz,Sadi and others.It is said that one of the Iravan poets would read his poems so melodiously that people gave him the nickname Mirza Andalif (Mirza Bülbül (Nightingale – trans.))[95,903].Special attention was paid to calligraphy,both in schools and madrasas.In addition to schools and madrasas,individual education also existed in the Iravan Khanate.Special teachers were engaged in the education of the children of khans or warlords,noblemen and merchants.According to I.Shopen’s records,one could find copies of the books taught in schools,especially those concerning the “Qur’an” and Shariat in every Muslim’s home,and even several copies of each of those books.He writes that Armenians were poorly supplied with books.One could see the “Bible”,or any other book,quite rarely and only in the houses of 188 AZERBAIJAN NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES,A.A.BAKIKHANOV INSTITUTE OF HISTORY T H E I R A В А Н K H A N A T E THE RUSSIAN OCCUPATION AND THE RELOCATION OF ARMENIANS TO THE LANDS OF NORTH AZERBAIJAN some rich Armenians [95,917].This proves that the city of Iravan was among the advanced scientific and cultural centres of Azerbaijan in the period of the khanates.Unlike Muslims,the relocated Armenians did not have advanced science and education.Epigraphic monuments.Epigraphic remains of the XVIII century were found on architectural monuments,tombs and household goods made of clay,metal,wood and other durable materials.Those scripts were reflected on coffers,tombstones,headstones,ram-shaped and horse-shaped gravestones,placards hanging on the walls of caravanserais,public baths,madrasas,fortresses etc.Sources of the time and epigraphic monuments inform us that many construction projects were carried out in the Iravan Khanate,including the construction of the Sardar (khan)Palace,estates,the Iravan and Sardarabad Fortresses.Caravanserais,mosques,baths,bazaars etc.were built in those fortresses [see:end of chapter,pic.24,25].An example of the Azerbaijani-Turkish architectural monuments existing in the Iravan Khanate and reaching our times is a tomb in Jafarabad village (renamed Argavand by a decree of the Armenian SSR Supreme Soviet dated 04.04.1946).A renowned scientist,Mashadi khanim Nemat,investigating the scripts on the tomb writes that the Jafarabad Tomb is the single historic monument and artwork speaking of the past of these places (Nematova M.Stone Memory of Centuries,Baku,Elm Journal (Science Journal – trans.),1987,p.40-41)[95,917].The twelve-sided sepulchre,built from the local tuf stone,12-metres in height and a 5-metre inner diameter is decorated in the oriental architectural style of the Middle Ages [see:end of chapter,pic.1,2].The sepulchre was erected in 1414 by Amir Saad of Garagoyunlu’s son,the governor of the Iravan valley,Pir Hüssein,over his father’s grave.The name of the sepulchre’s builder and ayahs (lines-trans)in Arabic from the “Qur’an” are inscribed in Naskh script on a 50-cm-wide frieze under 189 AZERBAIJAN NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES,A.A.BAKIKHANOV INSTITUTE OF HISTORY T H E I R A В А Н K H A N A T E THE RUSSIAN OCCUPATION AND THE RELOCATION OF ARMENIANS TO THE LANDS OF NORTH AZERBAIJAN the sepulchre’s dome.According to an Armenian historian,A.Papazyan,the local population recollects that there were two more sepulchres of smaller size and with domes in that area,which were later pulled down by Armenians in order to use their stones on nearby construction sites [Паpаzən А.Аrаbскаə nаDpiсğ nа гrоbniüе turкmеnскiх Эmirоv v сеlе АrгаvаnD.Curnаl « Бlicniy i сrеDniy Восtок» Сb.сtаtеy pаməti Б.İ.ЗахоDеrа,Москvа 1961,p.68-75].Epigraphic monuments also include the scripts inscribed on gravestones – epitaphs.Epitaphs told of the name,date of death and social status of the person buried.The headstone and tombstone of a deceased person contained pictures describing the person’s occupation or profession.Most of the scripts inscribed in the beautiful Naskh script,applying a method of bolding were surrounded with Nabati ornament motifs.All the scripts had Islamic ornaments inscribed on them.For example:the upper parts of the headstones in an Azerbaijani-Turkish cemetery near Gümrü were made in triangular or curved shapes.As seen from the picture,two circular hexagrams are inscribed on the front headstone with a crescent drawn over them.In the horizontal frame under the circles,an ayah from “Qur’an” is engraved.Under the frame,there is an accentuated rectangular strip that both looks like a sword and also expresses the symbolism of “the tree of life”.There was also a circular-domed sepulchre in that cemetery [АхunDоv Д.А.Аrхitекturа Drеvnего i rаnnесrеDnеvеко vо го АzеrbаyDcаnа,Бакu,1986,p.250,251; see:end of chapter,pic.4].However,all the cemeteries,both on the ancient territory of the Iravan Khanate and on the territory of the modern Republic of Armenia,have been destroyed and ruined by Armenian van-dals.The Muslim cemeteries have either had houses built on top of them or have been turned into crop fields.190 AZERBAIJAN NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES,A.A.BAKIKHANOV INSTITUTE OF HISTORY T H E I R A В А Н K H A N A T E THE RUSSIAN OCCUPATION AND THE RELOCATION OF ARMENIANS TO THE LANDS OF NORTH AZERBAIJAN Architecture and art.Many written sources confirm the existence of hundreds of architectural monuments and widespread traces of national-decorative art on the territory of the Iravan Khanate,particularly in the city of Iravan.One feature specific to the period of the khanates was the significance of building estates and,appropriately,palace complexes in the form of estate fortresses.The construction of defence structures around the city and on the khanate’s territory was also of vital importance.The building of mosques was the main business in the construction of religious edifices [107,481].In the city of Iravan,special attention was paid to the construction of private houses in a particular architectural style [see:end of chapter,pic.27,28].Today there is no trace of the Iravan and Sardarabad Fortresses,which were built for defensive purposes in the Iravan Khanate,but have entered history as architectural complexes.Despite having been destroyed numerous times,due to the constant wars,the Iravan Fortress built to Shah Ismail’s order in 1510-1517,was restored again by warlords and khans.According to a plan drawn after the Iravan Fortress was occupied by Russians in the early XIX century,the Fortress was almost square-shaped (790 x 850)and covered an area of 7 hectares.The double-row walls of the Fortress were 4.5 km long.The 10.5 – 12 m high outer fortress walls surrounded its territory in the north-east,south-east and south-west.The other side of the area rested on the rocky River Zangi.The fortress walls were placed 36-42 m apart.Semi-circular towers were erected on the fortress walls with strong outer and inner defence walls.Approximately 2450 fire-loopholes were built into the towers.With 53 cannons placed along the defence walls,the Iravan Fortress had two gates – the Tabriz and Shirvan Gates.A ditch was dug along the outer line of the Fortress walls and filled with water from the River Qedar [see:end of chapter,pic.5,6].191 AZERBAIJAN NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES,A.A.BAKIKHANOV INSTITUTE OF HISTORY T H E I R A В А Н K H A N A T E THE RUSSIAN OCCUPATION AND THE RELOCATION OF ARMENIANS TO THE LANDS OF NORTH AZERBAIJAN Jean Chardin,having visited Iravan in 1672-1673,mentioned that there were 2 more mosques and a bath in the Iravan Fortress,inhabited solely by pure-blood Safavids [10,21-22].A magnificent edifice in its time,the Iravan Fortress,together with the architectural monuments inside,has been wiped out of existence.Chardin noted there was an ancient tomb a cannon shot’s distance from the Iravan Fortress,but he could not learn its date of construction [10,21-22].Armenian researchers mention that the tomb was similar to the Atabey architectural monument in Nakhchivan.In the tomb’s picture drawn by Chardin,two outstanding mosques are portrayed behind the monument,with minarets rising to the skies.The portrayed architectural monument was also wiped out of existence at the beginning of the XIX century [see:end of chapter,pic.3].Another architectural edifice existing in the Iravan Khanate was the Sardarabad Fortress.This astonishing fortress,built by Hüsseingulu khan of Iravan from 1815-1817,was in the form of square.The Sardarabad Fortress was built with the participation of French engineers used to have double walls,strong towers and a gate.A Russian artist Grigori Gagarin depicts the battlefield in front of the Sardarabad Fortress in his picture executed in oil in 1840 [see:chapter 8,pic.4].Armenian vandals have also wiped out this magnificent fortress.European travellers Kerr-Porter,James Morrier,Mon Pere,Cameron,Lynch and others went to Iravan at different times and described in their works the Khan Palace,its Mirror Saloon,the mosques in the fortress and city,pools and baths,as well as the underground marble stairway stretching from the River Zangi.The most striking of the estate-related architectural examples was the Sardar Palace or Khan Palace.Chardin writes that the Sardar Palace was built in the fortress,near the canyon on the bank of the Zangi river,and it created a very nice impression in summer.The New Khan Palace 192 AZERBAIJAN NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES,A.A.BAKIKHANOV INSTITUTE OF HISTORY T H E I R A В А Н K H A N A T E THE RUSSIAN OCCUPATION AND THE RELOCATION OF ARMENIANS TO THE LANDS OF NORTH AZERBAIJAN was built by a renowned Azerbaijani architect,Mirza Jafar of Khoy,during Hüsseinali khan’s reign (1764-1783).The main part of the palace – The Mirror Saloon and Summer Estate-were added by Hüsseinali khan’s son,Mahammad khan,in 1791,which perfected the edifice as a monumental palace structure and completed it [Karimov Karim,“Palace of the Iravan Warlord”,” New Thought” newspaper,October 18,1995,#5].According to a comprehensive plan of the Sardar Palace of 1837,it covered an area of 1 hectare.The palace was located on the north-western side of the fortress complex and a door led from the fortress to the palace.The palace and harem were connected to each other,had a long facade and constituted a single architectural composition.The harem was connected to the palace by a small corridor [see:end of chapter,pic.7,8,9,10,11].The palace complex itself consisted of several palaces.The largest two-storey palace,intended for official events,was trapezoidal (36 x 35 x 31 x 25 m).In the middle of the palace there was a big balcony for solemn greeting of the shah.At the end of the balcony,sleeping places – couches,separated by arabesques and decorated with colourful glass,were placed facing the Zangi river.It is known that the floor of the couch currently kept in the Iravan Museum of History had a star-shaped pool made of onyx stones.In addition,there were two more palaces connected to this one – one for living quarters and the other as a secondary building.The two-storey,rectangular harem was connected to the palace from the south-western side and a big pool was built in the middle of it.The palace complex also included a mosque and a bathhouse.There was a big pool in the bathhouse decorated with mosaic and marble plates.This magnificent gem of oriental architecture was devastated by Armenian vandals at the beginning of the XX century.193 AZERBAIJAN NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES,A.A.BAKIKHANOV INSTITUTE OF HISTORY T H E I R A В А Н K H A N A T E THE RUSSIAN OCCUPATION AND THE RELOCATION OF ARMENIANS TO THE LANDS OF NORTH AZERBAIJAN A Russian archaeologist visiting Iravan in 1880,Praskovya Uvarova,wrote:“The only remnant of the magnificent fortress is the warlord’s saloon,built in oriental style,which astonishes with its mirror,decoration,taste and skill.The saloon looks like an ornamented tea ball.God,how have they destroyed estates adorned like a tray,or a salver! How much effort must have gone into destroying and wiping out monuments lasting centuries?!” [121,571].The most widespread and advanced form of visual art at the time was wall painting-reproduced on architectural monuments.European travellers and artists were more astonished by the artistic design of the warlord’s palace,as well as the monumental paintings-portraits and narrative compositions decorating the walls-rather than the sheer architecture of the palace.Records describing the Iravan Khan Palace’s interior arrangement,paintings by Russian artist and academician V.Mashkov in 1828,the archaeological researcher and artist G.Gagarin in 1840,photographer D.Yermakov in the 1960s,as well as life paintings and photographs by English explorer H.Lynch at the end of the century,convey the palace’s artistic design,as well as the content,form and style,professional craftsmanship and aesthetic features of the wall paintings.The creator of the original paintings adorning the palace’s Mirror Saloon and Summer Estate walls is unknown.The decorative and narrative wall paintings are rooted in contemporary canons and traditions.Decorative compositions offering geometrical and stylized Nabati motifs,as well as lively and realistic pictures of flowers,animals and birds are the traditional images portrayed on the vaults or inter-vault boards on wall surfaces above the panelling [See:Karim Karimov,the above-mentioned article].194 AZERBAIJAN NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES,A.A.BAKIKHANOV INSTITUTE OF HISTORY T H E I R A В А Н K H A N A T E THE RUSSIAN OCCUPATION AND THE RELOCATION OF ARMENIANS TO THE LANDS OF NORTH AZERBAIJAN Portraits and a variety of narrative compositions represented the core of the palace’s artistic design [See:Karim Karimov,the above-mentioned article].H.Lynch’s description of the Mirror Saloon reads:“The infinite mirrors of the ornamented vaults cast a brilliant glow over the whole place.The ceiling in the saloon is filled with decoration.The lower part of the ceiling is adorned with rich Nabati ornaments,consisting mainly of irises and roses” [101,216].Portraits of Fatali Shah,his son Abbas Mirza,Hüsseingulu khan of Iravan and his brother Hassan khan,Hero Faramaz,Rustam Zal,his son Zohrab and a woman,placed in similar and frames of uniform size hang on a strip between the ornamental panels and the ceiling on the Mirror Saloon’s front wall,shaped like a deep carcass vault [101,217; 215,181].A picture by V.Mashkov,a participant in the Russian army’s attack on Iravan depicts a crowded hunting scene between portraits of Fatali Shah and Abbas Mirza [see:Karim Karimov,above-mentioned article].In the 1850s,partial restoration was carried out in the Khan Palace,which was in shreds due to neglect,with its wall paintings eroded by humidity and mirrors falling off the eaves and the ceiling.The restoration was done by the founder of machine-industrial painting in Azerbaijan,Mirza Gadim Iravani (1825-1875).Having received no special education in painting,M.G.Iravani had learned the craft from his father,who was a graphic engraver.At the beginning of his creative career,he was involved in decorative art and drew a few portraits – “Suvari” (“Cavalier” – trans.),”Raggasa” (“Dancing lady” – trans.),“Dervish” etc.(Azerbaijan Museum of Art).Later,he restored the panels and narrative compositions in the Iravan warlord’s palace and depicted several epic portraits (of Fatali shah,Abbas Mirza etc.)in oil in the Mirror Saloon.His drawings of 1860-70s,titled “Vajihulla Mirza”,“Mullah”,“A Standing Woman”,“A 195 AZERBAIJAN NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES,A.A.BAKIKHANOV INSTITUTE OF HISTORY T H E I R A В А Н K H A N A T E THE RUSSIAN OCCUPATION AND THE RELOCATION OF ARMENIANS TO THE LANDS OF NORTH AZERBAIJAN Sitting Woman”,” Young Boy” are kept in the Azerbaijan Museum of Art,“Mah Talat”is in the Georgian National Museum of Art,and “Flowers and Birds” – is in the Hermitage,Saint Petersburg [ASE VI,Baku,1980,p.517-518; see:end of chapter,pic.12,13].Comparative analysis of the instructive material describing the palace’s outline before and after the restoration reveals that only some of the wall paintings – portraits and decorative panels-were restored.As the hunting,battle and love scenes were impossible to restore,new ornamental-decorative boards were drawn on them.While restoring the portraits,M.G.Iravani did not adopt a mechanical approach; instead he created new works of art,different from the previous ones,applying new technical methods.These pictures,drawn in oil on big pieces of linen and later glued to the walls,were,in fact,the first samples of realistic monumental painting.Therefore,these paintings are highly appreciated and considered as “the greatest examples of Asian painting” [See:Karim Karimov,above-mentioned article].Armenians claiming to be “an intelligent nation” also destroyed a rare gem of the East – the Warlord’s Palace-in 1918.Every single one of the mosques existing in the Iravan Khanate was an example of rare architecture.Research reveals that there was a grand mosque built to Shah Ismail’s order in 1510 in the city of Iravan,where Islamic values had become the daily norm.The mosque had a large yard,a pool and a high minaret.In 1918,Armenians filled the mosque,known as the Shah Ismail Mosque,with Azerbaijanis,poured oil into it and set fire to it [113,449].An Azerbaijani archaeologist,Isa Azimbeyov,exploring Moslem monuments in Iravan,noted in an article published in 1929 that he had seen the mosque built by decree of Shah Abbas near the Warlord’s 196 AZERBAIJAN NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES,A.A.BAKIKHANOV INSTITUTE OF HISTORY T H E I R A В А Н K H A N A T E THE RUSSIAN OCCUPATION AND THE RELOCATION OF ARMENIANS TO THE LANDS OF NORTH AZERBAIJAN Palace.Several displaced families were living in a madrasa located inside the half-destroyed mosque.He wrote that he had barely managed to read the following line engraved on the mosque:Zamane Shah Abbas jennetmekan,Az u kesht abad mulke-jahan [İzvесtiə Аzlоmiсtаriса,vıp.4,1929,page 299].M.Azimbeyov also wrote of the existence of another mosque,more ancient than the Shah Abbas Mosque,in the area.The mosque,built by Shah Khudabanda,was named after him.An inscription on the red-brick-mosque indicated its restoration in 1685,at the time of Shah Süleiman Safavid [İzvесtiə Аzlоmiсtаriса,vıp.4,1929,vıp.4,1929,page 299].There were 8 mosques in Iravan city right on the eve of the invasion by the Russian Empire.According to Shopen,2 of those mosques were located inside the fortress and 6 – the Zal khan,Novruzali khan,Sartip khan,Hüsseinali khan,Haji Imamverdi and Haji Jafar Bey mosques – outside the fortress [95,468].The grandest of all these mosques was a rare gem of Azerbaijani architecture – the Hüsseinali khan Mosque,or the Göy(Blue)Mosque.It was named the Blue Mosque because of the blue tiles decorating its walls.The mosque,situated in front of Iravan’s central covered bazaar,was constructed in 1760-1768,during Hüsseinali khan’s reign.In its composition and the shape of its main prayer-room,the Blue Mosque was reminiscent of the Juma Mosque built in 1616,during Shah Abbas’ reign in Ganja.Its dimensions were 97.2 x 66 metres.A stone pool with a fountain was built in its yard with dense,shady trees planted around it.Armenians burnt the mosque in 1988.Recently another mosque has been built in its place,which is one tenth of the size and is called “The Persian Mosque”.197 AZERBAIJAN NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES,A.A.BAKIKHANOV INSTITUTE OF HISTORY T H E I R A В А Н K H A N A T E THE RUSSIAN OCCUPATION AND THE RELOCATION OF ARMENIANS TO THE LANDS OF NORTH AZERBAIJAN The Zal Khan,or the Urban Mosque (date of construction unknown)and the Novruzali Khan Mosque were similar to each other and smaller than the Blue Mosque.The other three mosques were built in the XVII-XVIII centuries [see:end of chapter,pic.13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21].The Rajab Pasha Mosque was constructed in 1725 and the Abbas Mirza Mosque – during Hüsseingulu khan’s reign,at the beginning of the XIX century.The two-storey Zal Khan Mosque,with many chambers,was located near the present-day Iravan Hotel.After the Second World War,the mosque’s designation was changed.Currently,the building serves as the exhibition salon of the House of Artists.Several mosques were operational in Iravan until the first half of the XX century.The Tapabashi Mosque,built by Abbasgulu khan,a mosque built by Assad agha near the Iravan Women’s Club and the Körpübulag Mosque have been destroyed and obliterated by Armenians.The Chatirli Mosque,built by Haji Müzaffar agha,was burnt and razed to the ground in 1988 [113,452; see:end of chapter,pic.23].Although the architectural monument which was first a Jewish synagogue,then purchased by Armenians in the late XIX century and turned into the “Armenian Church”,still remains in the centre of Baku,all of the 8 Azerbaijani mosques that existed in Iravan in the early XX century have been razed to the ground by Armenian vandals.8 public baths existed in the city of Iravan,each one a rare pearl of architecture.According to Armenian authors,the saloons of all these baths were built in oriental style,each had a dome and was lit from above.Now all of those baths,built from red brick and limestone,are destroyed.I.Shopen provides their names:1.City (Shahri)Bath; 2.Sheikhülislam Bath; 3.Mehdi Bey Bath; 4.Haji Bayim Bath; 5.Tapabashi Bath; 6.Haji Ali Bath; 7.Haji Fatali Bath; 8.Karim Bey Bath [95,469].198 AZERBAIJAN NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES,A.A.BAKIKHANOV INSTITUTE OF HISTORY T H E I R A В А Н K H A N A T E THE RUSSIAN OCCUPATION AND THE RELOCATION OF ARMENIANS TO THE LANDS OF NORTH AZERBAIJAN Countless relics of decorative and applied arts,including graphic stone and wood carvings,ironwork,carpets,pottery ware and ornamental knitted patterns have been inherited from the Iravan Khanate.Unfortunately,a very large majority of these works of art are currently displayed in museums and other places of storage in the Republic of Armenia as relics of art “belonging to Armenians”.Carpet-weaving held a special place within the decorative arts in the Iravan Khanate.Samples of the Iravan carpet-weaving school,which was close to the Garabagh and Tabriz carpet-weaving schools,have been carried to foreign countries through the centuries,becoming items for Armenian collectors.The carpets currently presented to the world markets under the names “Yerevan carpet” or “Armenian carpet”,were woven by Azerbaijani masters of the loom.The weaving of carpets,mats,rugs,shaddas(type of carpet)etc.is an attribute alien to the national mentality of Armenians,having never been engaged in sheep breeding [see:end of chapter,pic.29,30].Today there are hundreds of manuscripts and books with printed patterns,contemporary with the era of the Iravan Khanate,held in the Institute of Ancient Manuscripts-Matenadaran in Iravan.There was a dwelling quarter in Iravan engaged in painting.That quarter was called the Shilachi Quarter.Prints dyed in various vegetal colors were produced [see:end of chapter,pic.31,32,33].Another widespread form of folk art is literary embroidery.2 works of literary embroidery from the time of the Iravan Khanate are currently stored in the Azerbaijani National Museum of History.4 flags of the Iravan Khanate were captured by Russian troops when they invaded the Iravan Fortress on October 1,1827 [177,361].Later,the flags were kept 199 AZERBAIJAN NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES,A.A.BAKIKHANOV INSTITUTE OF HISTORY T H E I R A В А Н K H A N A T E THE RUSSIAN OCCUPATION AND THE RELOCATION OF ARMENIANS TO THE LANDS OF NORTH AZERBAIJAN in the Caucasian Military Historical Museum.Then they were handed to the present Azerbaijani National Museum of History in 1924.The flags,held as inventory numbers 461 and 473,are considered to be rare examples of the craft of literary embroidery.We will describe only one of those flags here.The textile component of the three-sided flag belonging to the warlord of Iravan had dimensions of 145x261x217 cm.It is made of dark red broadcloth.Lion and Sun images (called Shiri-Khurshid)are sewn in patches on the flag’s wide upper area.The lion,made of a yellowish,light-brown patch,is depicted side-on with its tail bent over its waist and its right front paw lifted.The lion’s eyes are stitched in black and yellow,and its teeth,tongue and paws – with yellow thread.The human-faced,semi-circular Sun,peering from behind the lion,is made of yellow broadcloth.The Sun’s nose and brows are sewn in black and the eyes in black and yellow thread.The rays of the Sun,completed in blue fabric,are stitched on top of the flag’s cloth with light-brown silk thread.Two hexagonal cartouches,made of light brown fabric,are patched above and parallel to the images of the lion and Sun,placed next to each other.Two sentences in Arabic are sewn in takalduz stitch,with black silk thread,on the cartouche next to the lion’s tail:“I act in accordance with the law (Sharia)” and “With Allah’s help,victory is near”.Fringes in colourful (brown,light-brown and golden)silk thread are stitched onto the flag.A pouch,for fastening the flag cloth to its lead,is made of green broadcloth.A long tassel,woven with silver thread,hangs on the upper part of the flag holder.The flag was made in 1825-26 (1241 by the Muslim calendar).Portraits by Mirza Gadim Iravani also reflect the richest relics of literary embroidery.200 AZERBAIJAN NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES,A.A.BAKIKHANOV INSTITUTE OF HISTORY T H E I R A В А Н K H A N A T E THE RUSSIAN OCCUPATION AND THE RELOCATION OF ARMENIANS TO THE LANDS OF NORTH AZERBAIJAN Places of pilgrimage,sepulchral monuments and holy places.There were many graves of Sufis,scholars,sheikhs and maulanas,sites of spiritual guides and holy places which had become national pilgrimage centres in the Iravan Khanate.Shopen wrote that Tatars (i.e.Azerbaijanis – editor)in Iravan were buried near their houses,in cemeteries located in the city centre (all of which have been destroyed by Armenians – editor),sometimes in their gardens,yards and even under the thresholds of their houses.Every year,when pilgrims visited Mecca or Karbala,they collected the bones from those graves and buried them in the cemeteries where holy people had been buried [95,716-717].This derived from the deep attachment of the people of Iravan to holy places.2 mountains were called Mountain of Pilgrimage on the territory of the Iravan Khanate.One of them was in the basin of the Göycha lake and the other near Iravan [170,98].People would go to those mountains on pilgrimage in all seasons of the year,give alms and arrange animal sacrifices.There was a spiritual guide site in the city of Iravan itself,with a black stone inside.The spiritual site was called the Hazrat Abbas Site.Armenians have tried many times to destroy this holy site and build something else in its place,but every time an accident has occurred,causing them to fail to complete the demolition.Not only Azerbaijanis,but also Armenians,would go on pilgrimage to the Hazrat Abbas Site,which has recently been fenced,and light candles there.Another holy site on the Iravan Khanate’s territory is the Akhi Tavakkul Sepulchre,located in Alayaz village,in Daralayaz.His grave was visited on pilgrimage by both Azerbaijanis and Armenians.Only the foundation remains of this sepulchre built in 1543,and the constructions around it [Неmаt М.Эpiгrафiçескiе pаmətniкi АzеrbаyDcаnа,volume III,Baku,2001,p.75; see:end of chapter,pic.26].201 AZERBAIJAN NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES,A.A.BAKIKHANOV INSTITUTE OF HISTORY T H E I R A В А Н K H A N A T E THE RUSSIAN OCCUPATION AND THE RELOCATION OF ARMENIANS TO THE LANDS OF NORTH AZERBAIJAN The next holy centre in the Iravan Khanate is the Miskin Abdal Site.Founder of the Göycha ashig school,Miskin Abdal was among the most respected leaders of the Miskin tribe,deriving from the Rumlu branch of the Qizilbashs.The Rumlus were the Safavids’ closest allies in the propagation of the Shiite religious-philosophical ideology.Miskin Abdal and Shah Ismail were close friends.Born in Sariyagub village (the village’s ancient name was Siyagut)in Göycha mahal in 1470,Miskin Abdal lives on in the national memory,not only for his activity as an ashig-poet,but also for his holiness and his gift of justice bestowed by God.The site always filled with visitors,never lacking a pilgrim,serving as a place of hope for the dejected and a centre of healing for the sick; it was situated in Sariyagub village until 1988.The Miskin Abdal Site has been moved to the Garadaghli village of the Goranboy region of Azerbaijan.Shah Sultan Hüssein (1694-1722)visited the Miskin Abdal Site on pilgrimage and read the “Fatiha”(section of the “Qur’an” read for the dead-trans).A decree issued by Shah Sultan Hüssein and a certificate given by Shah Ismail,as well as the original document describing Miskin Abdal’s family tree,are currently held at the Miskin Abdal Site [see:end of chapter,pic.34].Literary environment.The Iravan Khanate had quite a prosperous literary environment.Although very few examples of writing have reached the present day,the pieces kept in the archives and libraries of neighbouring states prove the statement.Most of the precious manuscripts reflecting Iravan’s literary atmosphere were destroyed by Armenian vandals following the Russian invasion.The manuscripts kept in mosques and madrasas have mostly been burned,while some are still withheld in secret from Azerbaijani researchers.202 AZERBAIJAN NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES,A.A.BAKIKHANOV INSTITUTE OF HISTORY T H E I R A В А Н K H A N A T E THE RUSSIAN OCCUPATION AND THE RELOCATION OF ARMENIANS TO THE LANDS OF NORTH AZERBAIJAN Several manuscripts from the period of the khanates were stored in the library of the Blue Mosque in Iravan until the 1930s and 40s (the Repression).In an article entitled “Muslim Manuscripts of Tiflis,Iravan and the Nakhchivan SSR”,published in 1929,an Azerbaijani researcher,Isa Azimbeyov,told of his personal acquaintance with Mirza Hüssein (1868-1938)while visiting the Blue Mosque in Iravan.Mirza Hüssein agha introduced him to a rich library.I.Azimbeyov mentions the names of some of the works in his article.Born into a family of doctors and renowned as a talented scholar of Eastern Studies,Mirza Hüssein agha received a complete education in Baghdad and Najaf.His articles were published in Turkey and Iran.Like many Azerbaijani intellectuals of the time,Mirza Hüssein agha suffered under the repression in 1938,was exiled to the city of Kaluga and died there after some time.His rich library and manuscripts were plundered and burnt by Armenians [121,67,73].Relics of the renowned representatives of Eastern poetics were trans-lated by the poets of Iravan and read in literary gatherings by masters of recitation.The first information about the translators of Iravan was provided by Mahammad Hüssein Iravani.In 1657,he translated the “Gulustan” by Sadi Shirazi into Azerbaijani.The translation material is currently stored in the Central Library of Tabriz (#2941)[121,545].Both during the era of the khanates and in the years following the Russian invasion,works authored by Iravan writers were published in foreign countries.This was,first of all,related to the absence of a printing house in Iravan.Fazil Iravani’s “Rose and Nightingale” was published in 1812 in Saint Petersburg in Armenian and Russian; later,in 1826 – in Paris in Armenian; in 1832-1833 – twice in a row in French and in 1892 – in German and introduced to Armenian,Russian,French and German readers as “an original piece” by Khojens Markar Qeghamyan of Iravan.The literary relic was translated into French by 203 AZERBAIJAN NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES,A.A.BAKIKHANOV INSTITUTE OF HISTORY T H E I R A В А Н K H A N A T E THE RUSSIAN OCCUPATION AND THE RELOCATION OF ARMENIANS TO THE LANDS OF NORTH AZERBAIJAN Vayye de Floribal and into German by Joseph von Hammer.A French researcher clarified the issue in 1892,stating that the “Rose and Nightingale” is a relic authored by a Turkish writer Fazil Iravani.Having simply translated it into Armenian and Russian,Khojens Markar published it as “his own piece” and delivered to the world’s readers.Even after the book’s real author was revealed,Armenians still published the “Rose and Nightingale” as a work by an Armenian author in 1950 in Frezno (USA)[121,544].Local authors also published their books in other places and also in their native language,along with foreign languages.The first such initiative was by Molla Hüssein Iravani.His 201-page illustrated book,“Museyibname”,was published in Tabriz in 1888.One year later,Mirza Agha Ali Hakimi Iravani’s collection of novhas and ghazals was pub-lished in Tabriz.The 239-page collection was published in Azerbaijani and Persian [121,544].In 2001,Samad Sardarinian’s 245-page book,“Iravan was a Land of Muslims”,was published in Tehran by the “Zofa Publishing House”.The result of the author’s many years of research,the book depicts the fictitious establishment of an Armenian state on historical Azerbaijani lands and the process of turning the city of Iravan,which had been an Azerbaijani city for centuries,into the capital of the Republic of Armenia,using historical and scientific facts.The book’s last chapters present materials consisting of the documents and photographs of several families who survived the genocide committed by Armenians in Iravan,and provides detailed information about the famous Blue Mosque and other mosques of Iravan,Islamic monuments whose remnants remain in Armenia,scholars and religious figures,renowned personalities,and the poets and writers of Iravan.Another interesting feature of the book“Iravan was a Land of Muslims” is that a 300-beyt 204 AZERBAIJAN NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES,A.A.BAKIKHANOV INSTITUTE OF HISTORY T H E I R A В А Н K H A N A T E THE RUSSIAN OCCUPATION AND THE RELOCATION OF ARMENIANS TO THE LANDS OF NORTH AZERBAIJAN masnavi by a famous poet of Iravan,Mirza Müslum Güdsi,dedicated to Iravan,is published in it.S.Sardarinian mentioned that a copy of M.M.Güdsi’s collection of poems,including the above-mentioned masnavi,was kept in Haji Mahammad Nakhchivani’s library in section number 2814.The book also includes poems,mostly praising the beauty of Iravan,by such poets as Ashufta Iravani,Ashub Iravani,Cheshma Iravani,Hijjat Iravani,Dalil Iravani,Fakhri Iravani,Gudsi Iravani and Nazim Iravani,all of whom wrote under the “Iravani” signature [Madatli E.Samad Sardarinian’s 245-page book “Iravan was a Land of Muslims”.History and its problems,2002,#2,p.196-199].In the Middle Ages,several ashig schools were established in the Iravan Khanate.The richest of them was the Göycha Ashig School.The founder of the Göycha Ashig School,Miskin Abdal (1470-1535),visited the shah’s palace by Shah Ismail Khatai’s invitation and headed the ashig assembly there.Miskin Abdal’s garaylis,goshmas,divans and tajnis are considered rare pearls of our Turkic languaged poems from the XV-XVI centuries.An eminent graduate of this school was Ashig Allahverdi (1754-1860)known also as the Agh (white-trans)Ashig.Agh Ashig,living in the Karkibash village of Göycha,was the teacher of Ashig Ali (1800-1911).The composer of many saz songs,Ashig Ali was the teacher of Ashig Alasgar (1821-1926),maestro of the Azerbaijani art of ashig.In 1918,Armenians killed Ashig Najaf,a student of Ashig Alasgar,by tying a samovar to his back and applying a mind-boggling torture [Göycha of Saz and Word,Baku,1999,page 13].Ashig Tüjjar (1780-1860)was among the most renowned representatives of the Gümrü Ashig School.He was famous both as an epic-narrator and as a creative ashig and had many students.Ashig Beymuraz,who is known to have lived in the XVIII century,was engaged with the ashig craft in Gümrü for a long time,became famous as 205 AZERBAIJAN NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES,A.A.BAKIKHANOV INSTITUTE OF HISTORY T H E I R A В А Н K H A N A T E THE RUSSIAN OCCUPATION AND THE RELOCATION OF ARMENIANS TO THE LANDS OF NORTH AZERBAIJAN a legendary ashig of justice and featured in many tales describing his life.He was buried in the “Five Saints Cemetery” near Gümrü city at the end of the XVIII century.His grave became a site of pilgrimage.Armenian vandals have also wiped out that cemetery.Another ashig living and creating in Gümrü was Shirakli Hassan.Born in 1692 in the Garachanta village of Aghbaba,Hassan had a perfect command of Arabic,Persian and Georgian.Later,living in Gümrü,he fell in love with a girl named Leyli,but he was not allowed to marry her.After that,Hassan left Gümrü for Sarigamish.He died there in 1752.A book by Shirakli Hassan was published in Ganja in the XIX century.The only practical language in the Iravan Khanate was the Azerbaijani Turkish language.Russian historian and statistician I.Shopen conducted a census on the territories of the Iravan and Nakhchivan khanates from 1829-1832 and came to the following conclusion regarding the “Tatar language” – Azerbaijani:“It is impossible not to utter a few words about this famous language,spoken by millions of people from the shores of the Adriatic Sea to the shores of the Pacific,Indian and Atlantic Oceans,on one third of the Ancient World’s territories” [95,911].After visiting the Caucasus,the great Russian poet M.Y.Lermontov came to this conclusion:“I have started learning the Tatar language (i.e.Azerbaijani),this language is essential here and,in general,in the the whole of Asia,just like French is essential in Europe” [Lermontov M.,Full collection of books (in Russian),volume V,Moscow-Leningrad,1937,page 393].Oral folk literature had introduced rich relics into the Iravan region even before the times of the khanates.Frequent musical gatherings are said to have been arranged in the Iravan khan’s palace.Having visited Iravan in 1673,a French traveller,Jean Chardin,described a musical party arranged for Gulam Shah (a shah’s envoy visiting Iravan at that 206 AZERBAIJAN NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES,A.A.BAKIKHANOV INSTITUTE OF HISTORY T H E I R A В А Н K H A N A T E THE RUSSIAN OCCUPATION AND THE RELOCATION OF ARMENIANS TO THE LANDS OF NORTH AZERBAIJAN time – editor)in the Warlord’s Palace.He wrote that after the wrestling entertainment was finished,the yard was covered by tents,beautiful carpets were laid in the upper area and a big group of musicians and dancers entered.The European traveller writes:“…they were on the scene for over two hours,boring no one.The ruler (i.e.the warlord of Iravan – editor)was watching them during this time,speaking to the shah’s envoy and the people at the party and made me speak about Europe.In accordance with the shah palace’s system of service,provincial leaders also have a similar and complex system of servants.Musicians and dancers are a part of this system of servants.In the East,there is no such thing as dancing for entertainment or as a nice way of spending time with each other.For them,dance is as an art or a craft and is similar to the European art of theatre… The musicians and the dancers were the mimicking actors (actors entertaining by displaying mimicry)or comedians of the East,more precisely,this is their form of opera” [10,23,28].This means that the Warlord’s palace in Iravan was staging theatre and operas as far back as the XVII century.At that time,Armenians did not have a state,a tradition of statehood or literary gatherings in this land.Armenians were only engaged in imitating the folklore and music of the nations living all around them.An Armenian researcher,S.Palasanyan,wrote about the fact that Armenians have made use of other nations and created songs and melodies under the influence of these nations:“Our songs have diverse tunes.We have inherited the Turkish tune in Turkey,Georgian in Georgia,Persian in Iravan,Shusha,Aghkilsa and Iran,in general,melodies of the songs created by the nations under whose influence we have lived” [See:Abbasov I.Azerbaijani Folklore in Armenian sources of the XIX century.Baku,1977,page 65].About 150 years ago,an Armenian writer,Mikael Nalbandyan,noted,regarding the melodies and songs presented to the world today as “Armenian songs”:“Yet,most of the songs have been taken from the 207 AZERBAIJAN NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES,A.A.BAKIKHANOV INSTITUTE OF HISTORY T H E I R A В А Н K H A N A T E THE RUSSIAN OCCUPATION AND THE RELOCATION OF ARMENIANS TO THE LANDS OF NORTH AZERBAIJAN Turks (Azerbaijanis-editor).I have been to many places inhabited by Armenians and I have always tried to hear something purely Armenian.However,so far I have not succeeded in hearing such a thing” [See:Abbasov I.Azerbaijani Folklore in Armenian sources of the XIX century.Baku,1977,page 65].The richness,poetics and musical harmony of the Azerbaijani language caused the Armenians living on the territory of the Iravan Khanate to write and create in this language.An Armenian writer Khachatur Abovyan wrote:“Even women and children know Turkish.Therefore,it is quite a natural phenomenon for popular and renowned people and gifted poets to write poems in the Tatar (Azerbaijani – editor)language”.Another reason for the Armenian ashigs to benefit from Azerbaijani language,apart from the affluent form and content of Azerbaijani folk literature,was the rapid progress of Azerbaijani folk literature since the XV-XVI centuries.Yet another reason was that the Armenian literary language – Ashkharabar-was not fully developed until the first half of the XIX century.Since the majority of Armenian writers were writing in the old Armenian dialect – Grabar-the Armenian nation did not understand their work.An Armenian historian,Leo (Arakel Babakhanyan),came to the conclusion that Armenian ashigs were composing their songs in the Azerbaijani language due to the poverty of its Armenian counterpart.He wrote:“For ashigs,the Turkish (Azerbaijani – editor)language is smoother,more expressive and affluent than Armenian dialects for portraying the life described in tales and songs”.Armenian ashigs succeeded in assembling a large auditorium with the help of Azerbaijani languages.Professor A.Arsharuni also confirmed that the Azerbaijani language “… was almost the native language of Armenian ashigs and the Armenian nation.Otherwise,they (i.e.Armenian ashigs)could not have achieved success with their audience and their language would have been incomprehensible to the latter” [See:208 AZERBAIJAN NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES,A.A.BAKIKHANOV INSTITUTE OF HISTORY T H E I R A В А Н K H A N A T E THE RUSSIAN OCCUPATION AND THE RELOCATION OF ARMENIANS TO THE LANDS OF NORTH AZERBAIJAN Abbasov I.Azerbaijani Folklore in Armenian sources of the XIX century.Baku,1977,page 102].There are many records of XVII century Armenian ashigs writing and creating in the Azerbaijani language.Some samples of their work are kept in Matenadaran and the Armenian Museum of Literature and Art.The names of several Armenian ashigs composing songs in the Azerbaijani language in the XVIII century:– Sayat Nova,Miran,Baghiroghlu,Emiroghlu,Gul Yegaz,Turab Dede,Shamji Meleko,Junior Nova,Gul Hovanes and others are well-known.There were ashig schools composing songs in the Azerbaijani language led by Ashig Shirin in Iravan and Ashig Baven in Gümrü [E.Yerevanli,Azeri-Armenian literary connections,Iravan,1968,page 282].Doctor of Philological Sciences Israfli Abbasov,who has thoroughly explored Azeri-Armenian literary connections and conducted research in the archives of Matenadaran and Armenia for many years,notes that there is not a single Armenian manuscript from the XVII-XVIII centuries,and especially the XIX century,in which one would not stumble upon ancient songs of the Azerbaijani nation.I.Abbasov,referring to inventory numbers of the precious manuscripts stored in Matenadaran,which contain samples of Azerbaijani folklore and countless literary materials in written form,has also developed a table identifying their recorded dates.Taking into account Armenian professionalism in losing track of documents and original sources related to Azerbaijan,we present the table in its original form.All of these factors show that an Azerbaijani state unit,the Iravan Khanate,possessed quite a prolific history,as well as a unique and ancient cultural heritage.Exploration of this heritage and its delivery to future generations represents one of the most essential and pressing problems of the present day.209 AZERBAIJAN NATIONAL

the Russian Empire and the Gajars State 7 The third stage of the Iravan Khanate’s foreign policy wascharacterized by its principal struggle against the Russian Empire to preserve its independence.Armenian and most Russian historical researchers falsify history by presenting the Russian invasion of an Azerbaijani state,the Iravan Khanate,as the annexation of “Eastern Armenia” or “Armenia” to Russia.In reality,there was no Armenian state in the South Caucasus during the Russian occupation of these territories in the early XIX century.The lands occupied by Russia were not “Armenia”,but the territories of an Azerbaijani state,the Iravan Khanate,that is,Azerbaijani lands.During the first Russian-Iranian War from 1804-1813,the Iravan Khanate suffered two strong assaults by Russian troops.Nevertheless,the Iravan Khanate did not surrender to Russia.The khanate’s population,headed by the wise and brave state figures,Mahammad khan Gajar and Hüsseingulu khan Gajar,resisted the tsarist troops heroically.However,the tsarist Russia did not give up the plan to invade this Azerbaijani khanate,which was of crucial value in its fight against the Ottoman state.At the beginning of the XIX century,the conquest of the South Caucasus was an important goal of Russia’s foreign policy.The annexation of Eastern Georgia (the Kartli-Kakheti Tsardom)to Russia in 1801 expedited the process to invade the South Caucasus.By a decree dated February 16,1801,issued by Tsar Alexander I (1801-1825),the Shöreyel,Pambak,Gazakh,Borchali and Shamshaddil sultanates of Azerbaijan were annexed to Russia [150,372; 132,28] together with Eastern Georgia [178,25].The Russian subjugation of Azerbaijani lands,including the Shöreyel and Pambak sultanates belonging to the Iravan Khanate,angered the Khans of Iravan and Ganja [25,document 801,802,p.598-599; 132,28; 41,II,448].Russia was advancing military preparations aimed at invasion of the whole Iravan Khanate,of such critical strategic value.287 AZERBAIJAN NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES,A.A.BAKIKHANOV INSTITUTE OF HISTORY T H E I R A В А Н K H A N A T E THE RUSSIAN OCCUPATION AND THE RELOCATION OF ARMENIANS TO THE LANDS OF NORTH AZERBAIJAN Most of the Azerbaijani khans,including Mahammad khan Gajar of Iravan and Kalbali khan of Nakhchivan,while enduring the harshest military-political pressure from Russia,were willing to defend their independence.The most decisive fighter against Russian aggression,the Khan of Iravan,called upon the Pambak population not to yield to the invaders and urged them to leave the territories occupied by Russian troops and move to Iravan.600 inhabitants of Pambak left their villages after the khan’s appeal and found shelter in Iravan [150,402; 132,28].At the same time,the khan sent his delegate to General I.P.Lazaryev to claim ownership of Pambak Province in accordance with the shah’s decree.The Khans of Iravan and Nakhchivan united,mobilized their military forces and decided not to allow the Russian troops into Pambak [150,402-403; 132,28-29].To keep the upper hand in military operations,troops led by the tsarist general of Armenian origin,I.P.Lazaryev,entered Pambak on June 30 [25,document 799,p.598; 132,29].The imperial general turned first to the Pambak elders,requesting their assistance in returning the population of Pambak who had left for the Iravan Khanate [25,document 800,p.598].Meeting no success,I.P.Lazaryev wrote to the Khan of Iravan demanding the return of the Pambak population,stating that otherwise the khan would rouse the anger of the Russian Emperor against himself [25,document 801,p.598-599].Interestingly,at the time,the Georgian Prince David also changed his attitude towards Russia.On account of the grave conditions suffered by Georgia after the Russian invasion,he recommended the Khan of Iravan not to surrender to Russia.The Georgian Princes David,Vakhtang,Yulon and Alexander asked for the Iravan khan’s help in clearing Georgia of Russian troops [150,404].This fact is proof of the political authority and military power of the Iravan Khanate at that time.288 AZERBAIJAN NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES,A.A.BAKIKHANOV INSTITUTE OF HISTORY T H E I R A В А Н K H A N A T E THE RUSSIAN OCCUPATION AND THE RELOCATION OF ARMENIANS TO THE LANDS OF NORTH AZERBAIJAN Despite all this,Russia’s main focus was on the invasion of the Iravan Khanate.Russian foreign policy institutions attached special importance to the conquest of the Iravan Khanate bordering on Iran,Turkey and Georgia and eagerly debated “the significance of capturing the Iravan Fortress located on the Tiflis-Tabriz transit road”.For Russia,the Iravan Khanate was not only essential strategic territory,but also a strategic base,allowing usage of this Azerbaijani land for the restoration of peace in Georgia and the undermining of Iranian and Turkish political influence in the South Caucasus.Exactly for this reason,the Iravan Khanate was the first on the list of territories to be subjugated to Russia indicated in a decree issued by Tsar Alexander I [178,38; 25,document 548,p.436].At the beginning of the XIX century,the Armenian Gregorian Church and rich Armenians took an active part in the invasion of the South Caucasus,including Azerbaijani territories,by the Russian Empire.Archbishop Grigory of the Üchkilsa Monastery,having arrived in Tiflis from Iravan at that time,provided Russian army headquarters in Tiflis,including I.P.Lazaryev of Armenian origin,with reconnaissance reports and tried to persuade them not to believe the khans of Iravan and Nakhchivan,because “…the Khan of Iravan is inclined towards the Russians only in outer appearance and,in fact,he feels an inner hatred for them [25,document 838,p.617-618; 115,89].And … the Khan of Iravan wants to remove the Pambak District from Russian control,relying on Kalbali khan of Nakhchivan” [25,document 838,p.617-618; 115,89].Accepting the information of his compatriot,the Armenian priest,as “the main argument”,I.P.Lazaryev sent many new troops to the Pambak District belonging to Azerbaijani Turks and returned almost the entire population of 14 villages,who left Pambak for the Iravan Khanate to protest the occupation of Pambak.After this event,some of the Pambak beys escaped to Iravan,not wishing to surrender to Russia [25,document 838,617-618; 115,89].289 AZERBAIJAN NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES,A.A.BAKIKHANOV INSTITUTE OF HISTORY T H E I R A В А Н K H A N A T E THE RUSSIAN OCCUPATION AND THE RELOCATION OF ARMENIANS TO THE LANDS OF NORTH AZERBAIJAN The weakening of Russia’s political opponents in the South Caucasus on the eve of invasion created favourable conditions for the expansion of its invasion plans for the area.That is,Russia had deprived the Ottoman Empire,a brake on the strengthening of its positions in the region,of political involvement in the South Caucasus,including Azerbaijan,by the Yassy Treaty of 1792.Further,the political instability reigning in the Gajars State at that time presented wide scope for l arge-scale Russian military operations in the region.Taking advantage of the encouraging situation,the Russian Empire tried to conquer the Iravan Khanate,located on the border between the Ottoman Empire and Gajars Iran,as soon as possible.The Russian Empire had been carefully preparing to invade Azerbaijani lands since the occupation of Georgia.Thus,after the conquest of Ganja and J ar-Balakan,Iravan was the target of the next assault.Hence,citing Mahammad khan of Iravan’s “connection with the Pambak beys”,the Commander-in-Chief of Russian troops in the Caucasus,K.F.Knoring,suggested that Mahammad khan accept Russian rule on April 18,1802 [25,document 840,p.618-619; 115,90].On April 24 of the same year,Tsar Alexander I gave new instructions to K.F.Knoring,ordering him to reinforce Russian troops in Georgia and keep them prepared for action,as well as to achieve the Iravan Khanate’s acceptance of Russian supremacy [115,90].Alexander I’s instruction clearly shows the importance attached by Russia to the Iravan Khanate’s strategic position and political authority.This is confirmed by the further fact that,having been informed of Mahammad khan of Iravan’s movement towards Russian troops positioned on the border,K.F.Knoring did not launch an immediate military confrontation,but wrote a letter to Mahammad khan on May 17,1802 demanding him explain his action [115,90].290 AZERBAIJAN NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES,A.A.BAKIKHANOV INSTITUTE OF HISTORY T H E I R A В А Н K H A N A T E THE RUSSIAN OCCUPATION AND THE RELOCATION OF ARMENIANS TO THE LANDS OF NORTH AZERBAIJAN Striving to protect the independence of the Iravan Khanate,Mahammad khan tried to avoid military conflict with K.F.Knoring and even persuade the latter of his desire to establish friendly relations with the Russians.In reality,he rejected many times Russian suggestions that he accept their rule and he even rejected the candidacy of Daniel for leadership of the Üchkilsa Monastery,as suggested by the Russians,retaining instead David,who was loyal to him [178,50; 115,90-91].After the Commander-in-Chief of Russian troops in the Caucasus,K.F.Knoring,was replaced by P.D.Sisianov (September 1802 – editor),Russian policy in the region became even harsher.Having just been appointed Commander-in-Chief,P.Sisianov decided to conquer the Iravan Khanate and return Daniel,who was in prison in Tehran,to Iravan in order to earn the trust of Armenians.At first the Russian general employed various diplomatic methods.In early February 1803,he sent a letter to the Khan of Iravan offering his sincere friendship and calling upon him to accept Russian rule.At the end of the letter,he demanded precise implementation of the decree concerning Daniel,who had been approved as Patriarch of All Armenians by the Great Russian Emperor and the Great Sultan (the Ottoman Sultan – editor)[26,document 1214,p.609].Although Mahammad khan gave orders to release Daniel from prison,he did not appoint Daniel as Patriarch and kept him under supervision [148,120; 188,19].P.D.Sisianov sent his delegate Tomas Orbeliani to Iravan to meet Mahammad khan in person and persuade him to accept the conditions laid down by him.For this purpose,he turned to the Khan of Iravan and Kalbali khan and sent a special delegation to the Iravan Khanate to deliver a letter stating his request about Daniel’s appointment as Patriarch.The delegation was instructed to conduct secret reconnaissance in the Iravan Khanate – to study the strong and weak points of the Iravan 291 AZERBAIJAN NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES,A.A.BAKIKHANOV INSTITUTE OF HISTORY T H E I R A В А Н K H A N A T E THE RUSSIAN OCCUPATION AND THE RELOCATION OF ARMENIANS TO THE LANDS OF NORTH AZERBAIJAN Fortress and the best routes from Kartli-Kakheti to Iravan [26,document 1215,p.609-610].However,the delegation did not yield any result.Mahammad khan Gajar of Iravan rejected all the Russian Commandant’s demands [26,document 1215,p.610; 148,121].Furious about this,P.D.Sisianov wrote in a report to the tsar on March 12,1803 that Mahammad khan of Iravan refused to implement His Excellency the Emperor’s high-level instruction to appoint Daniel as Armenian Patriarch.“His remaining unpunished is weakening Your Excellency’s authority in the territories we have captured by force.Therefore,I must go to Iravan with 6 detachments and position a garrison there in order to punish Mahammad khan and appoint Daniel as Armenian Patriarch.Local Armenian merchants promise to provide the garrison with food” [26,document 1216,p.610; 132,46].Nevertheless,realizing the toughness of the impending task of defeating the Iravan Khanate,P.D.Sisianov requested additional military help* from the Russian Emperor [26,document 1216,p.610].The Russian invasion of Jar-Balakan (March-April 1803)and the Ganja Khanate (3 January 1804)after difficult and bloody battles,increased P.D.Sisianov’s craving to conquer also the other Azerbaijani khanates.He sent a delegate to the Khans of Iravan and Garabagh demanding they surrender without battle and accept Russian rule [9,265].However,these negotiations did not yield any results.Trying to take advantage of the Iravan khan’s grave situation and achieve his goal,P.D.Sisianov sent another letter to Mahammad khan Gajar on May 10,1804.In the letter,the imperial general threatened the khan and stated his conditions:“1.First of all,to cease all negotiations 292 AZERBAIJAN NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES,A.A.BAKIKHANOV INSTITUTE OF HISTORY T H E I R A В А Н K H A N A T E THE RUSSIAN OCCUPATION AND THE RELOCATION OF ARMENIANS TO THE LANDS OF NORTH AZERBAIJAN * In his report dated 12 March 1803 to Alexander the First,P.D.Sisianov stated that he needed 3 more regiments and 100 thousand roubles to occupy the Iravan Khanate and he promised to conquer Iravan,Nakhchivan and Shusha,and even accomplish the invasion of areas along the Kur-Araz rivers with this help [26,document 1216,p.610; 148,121].with David and to restore Daniel to his position; 2.To surrender the Iravan Fortress to Russian troops; 3.The khan must accept the Russian Empire as his own state and take an oath of loyalty to it; 4.The khan must pay a tribute amounting to 80 thousand roubles divided into two parts – the first half to be paid one day after the Novruz Holiday and the second half – after July.If the khan remains loyal to us accepting these conditions,firstly,he will remain in power and continue his rule; secondly,the Emperor will issue a testimony stipulating his rights as khan to ensure his safety; and thirdly,every measure will be taken to bring the khan’s family back from Iran” [26,613-614; 115,92].Once again the negotiations yielded no result.This time,Mahammad khan stated resolutely to T.Orbeliani that he would not accept Russian rule.Having received a negative reply from Mahammad khan,P.D.Sisianov began to prepare a plan to attack Iravan.By May 1804,troop detachments of various types,selected for the assault on Iravan,were ready and started to assemble in Tiflis [74,258].Imperial General Sisianov,of Georgian origin,had as his main purpose,“to quickly complete the Iravan attack,annex the province to Russia and move the sphere of military operations in the imminent war against Iran from the Georgian borders” [67,95,97; 56,159; 132,47].Nevertheless,the tricky imperial general was writing letters to the Khan of Iravan,sometimes provoking,sometimes threatening and sometimes requesting the latter to surrender without resistance.The conditions,though,remained the same:Daniel must be declared Patriarch of Echmiadzin and David must be sent to Tiflis and yielded to the Russian commandant; in addition,Mahammad khan must agree to the positioning of Russian troops in the Iravan Fortress,pay a tribute to the invaders and take an oath of loyalty [26,document 1224,p.613].293 AZERBAIJAN NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES,A.A.BAKIKHANOV INSTITUTE OF HISTORY T H E I R A В А Н K H A N A T E THE RUSSIAN OCCUPATION AND THE RELOCATION OF ARMENIANS TO THE LANDS OF NORTH AZERBAIJAN It should be noted that,at this time,the Khan of Iravan faced a very complicated situation.The reason was that the Gajars State,not wishing to allow a Russian invasion of the essential strategic base – the Iravan Khanate-was also trying to conquer the Khanate’s territories [178,136].Both aggressors – Gajars Iran and Russia-were trying to outstrip each other in the invasion of the Iravan Khanate.Having been informed of an attack by Iranian troops on Iravan from the south,during negotiations with Sisianov,Mahammad khan was forced to make a political manoeuvre responding to the course of events,or more precisely,he decided to put order into his relations with Russia,which he considered to be the stronger enemy,and prevent the conquest of Iravan by Gajars Iran with help from the Russian military forces.With this purpose,Mahammad khan sent a messenger urgently to Tiflis,stating his desire to serve Russia.In return,he asked Sisianov to approach Iravan with his troops and stop the Iranians.Sisianov accepted the proposal on condition that Mahammad khan replaced David,who was “loyal” to Mahammad khan and whom he had appointed as leader of the Üchkilsa Monastery after the pro-Russian Iosif Argutinsky’s death,with the pro-Russian Daniel and ensure the positioning of 500 Russian soldiers in Iravan [26,document 1224,p.611-614; 115,93,94].Understanding Sisianov’s ploy,Mahammad khan rejected both the replacement of the Üchkilsa Patriarch and the entry of Russian troops into the Iravan Fortress [178,143-144].General Sisisanov even used this as an excuse for attacking the Iravan Khanate [see:maps 1,2].Consequently,the issue of replacing David with Daniel was again brought to the agenda,in order to allow the Russian troops,who had strengthened their position in the Pambak District,to intrude into Iravan.294 AZERBAIJAN NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES,A.A.BAKIKHANOV INSTITUTE OF HISTORY T H E I R A В А Н K H A N A T E THE RUSSIAN OCCUPATION AND THE RELOCATION OF ARMENIANS TO THE LANDS OF NORTH AZERBAIJAN The Russian researcher in Caucasian Studies,V.A.Potto,and the Armenian historian V.A.Parsamyan admitted this reality in writing the following:“The struggle between David and Daniel for the Üchkilsa throne was an excuse for our interference into the Iravan Khanate’s affairs” [178,129; 172,20].Thus,in May 1804,Russian troops headed by Sisianov approached the borders of the Iravan Khanate.As mentioned,the main purpose of the Russian commandant in this assault was to prepare the foundation for the future hegemony of Russia in the region by invading the Iravan Khanate and establishing an impenetrable barrier on the Turkish and Iranian borders [115,95].To this end,Russia was trying to implement its plan to establish an “Armenian state” as a support against the Turkish and Muslim states – the Ottoman Empire and Gajars Iran-by making use of the religious factor.It is not by chance that even a Russian historian,P.I.Kovalevski,admits that P.D.Sisianov,who was sent to the Caucasus to conquer it was told to treat Armenians with special care and attention and protect them in the implementation of his military plans [67,79-82].In addition,P.D.Sisianov was instructed to take Armenians under his protection and treat them with special care [67,79-82].Trying to manoeuvre between the Russian Empire and Gajars Iran,Mahammad khan began to take defensive measures and reinforce the Iravan Fortress.He moved the population of surrounding villages to the Fortress and ordered them to bring military weapons and food reserves with them.The khan’s policy led to an increase in the fortress’ defence force to 7 thousand people; 22 cannons,ready for use,were perched on the fortress walls and large food reserves were gathered to provide for the population sheltered in the fortress [see:148,298; 74,267; 115,95-96].295 AZERBAIJAN NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES,A.A.BAKIKHANOV INSTITUTE OF HISTORY T H E I R A В А Н K H A N A T E THE RUSSIAN OCCUPATION AND THE RELOCATION OF ARMENIANS TO THE LANDS OF NORTH AZERBAIJAN To succeed in his attack on Iravan,Sisianov demanded 4 more regiments and 100 thousand silver rubles from the centre.With these forces* he promised to conquer not only Iravan,but even Nakhchivan and Shusha and complete that part of the invasion plans concerning territories located along the Kur-Araz Rivers in one campaign [26,document 1216,p.610].V.A.Potto writes that Sisianov planned to use these forces in order to establish Russian dominance not only in Iravan,but also on the territories between the Black Sea and Caspian Sea,and to turn the River Araz into a border between Russia and Iran [178,137].Bringing the invasion military forces to a ready state,Sisianov invited everybody who was willing to fight,in order to attract additional forces,and he promised remuneration to those showing special bravery in battle [26,document 1225,p.613; 132,47].The Armenians,having betrayed the Iravan khans,guided Sisianov during his assault on Iravan and rendered financial and military assistance to the Russian troops.Armenian authors note this fact with pride [147,95-96].Russian authors also admit this fact.For example,V.A.Potto wrote:“During Sisanov’s and Gudovich’s attacks on the Ganja and Iravan Khanates,Archbishop Johannes and the priest Nerses assembled an Armenian brigade of 1500 men and personally headed it” ]177,722; 178,138].All these facts prove that Armenians were not native to the South Caucasus,including the Iravan Khanate,and were,therefore,protecting the interests of the invaders,instead of the Azerbaijani lands in which 296 AZERBAIJAN NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES,A.A.BAKIKHANOV INSTITUTE OF HISTORY T H E I R A В А Н K H A N A T E THE RUSSIAN OCCUPATION AND THE RELOCATION OF ARMENIANS TO THE LANDS OF NORTH AZERBAIJAN * The military forces headed by Sisianov consisted of 3572 infantry armed with 12 cannons,3 squadrons,300 Kazaks and 200 Georgian Dukes and nobles led by Duke Orbeliani [178,137; 26,document 1216,p.610].they were living.In addition,betraying the state on whose territories they were living,Armenians were sending fake letters to Russian government circles.In a reference sent by Kovalenski,the civil advisor of Russia in Georgia,to the tsar,he wrote that an Armenian official …malik Avram stated that all Armenians living in the Iravan Khanate were inclined towards Russia [25,document 34,p.119].Imperial Russia was using the Christian forces*,mainly Armenian help and betrayal,at state level in carrying out the conquest of Azerbaijani khanates.For example,a decree issued by the tsar at that time included a special article about Armenians:“…I am leaving it to you to attract Armenians to yourselves with all tenderness” [25,document 548,p.436].The Russian and Iran threats,and the fate of Ganja,were driving Mahammad khan Gajar to act with absolute caution and to use political manoeuvres in order not to upset either side.According to V.Potto,the khan began to lean towards nearby Iran [178,136].However,these manoeuvres were of no importance.Fatali shah was trying to estrange Mahammad khan from the khanate,which the latter was ruling independently.** Russian troops had already begun the military operations aimed at conquering Iravan.Thus,in early June 1804,troops consisting of 1 regiment,2 detachments and 8 cannons commanded by Major-General S.A.Tuchkov invaded the Shöreyel province of the Iravan Khanate.Here they were joined by 2 Armenian archbishops and 100 Armenian horsemen [178,297 AZERBAIJAN NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES,A.A.BAKIKHANOV INSTITUTE OF HISTORY T H E I R A В А Н K H A N A T E THE RUSSIAN OCCUPATION AND THE RELOCATION OF ARMENIANS TO THE LANDS OF NORTH AZERBAIJAN * It must be noted that Georgian dukes also took part in Sisianov’s attack against the Iravan Khanate along with Sisianov’s own forces [see:178,137].** According to E.Khuboc’s records,the troops of Gajars Iran had already encircled the Iravan Khanate on June 1,1804,a bloody battle took place on 18th June and both sides suffered heavy losses [see:188,22,25-26].138; 148,311; 132,48-49].After bloody battles* ,the front line of Russian troops,having captured Shöreyel under S.A.Tuchkov’s command,also seized Gümrü on June 12 [148,311-312; 74,260-261].The first encirclement of the Iravan Fortress by Russian invaders and the heroic defence of the city (July 2-September 3,1804)On June 10,1804 diplomatic negotiations between Gajars Iran and Russia were stopped and war broke out between the two states within a few days.The Russian troops,reinforced in Gümrü,set off to Üchkilsa on June 15.Seizing Üchkilsa and Gamarli with great difficulty**,the Russian troops encircled the Iravan Fortress on July 2,at dawn [26,document 1668,p.810; 74,228,266].The Iravan Khan’s troops were well armed and the fortress’ defence was well organised.Even Armenian authors could not hide this and wrote about the strong resistance by the Khan of Iravan:“…On July 24,1804 Russian troops launched attacks against the Iravan Fortress from all sides.The stubborn resistance of the fortress garrison,with 60 cannons and 7000 soldiers,began against the Russians [171,21]”.There are interesting records about the Iravan Fortress and the defence garrison based there at that time.Those records reveal that the 298 AZERBAIJAN NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES,A.A.BAKIKHANOV INSTITUTE OF HISTORY T H E I R A В А Н K H A N A T E THE RUSSIAN OCCUPATION AND THE RELOCATION OF ARMENIANS TO THE LANDS OF NORTH AZERBAIJAN * The battle was between the Russian troops and a brigade of 8 thousand fighters sent by Abbas Mirza under the command of Mehdigulu khan Davali [see:127,30].** There was a bloody battle between the troops of Gajars Iran,based in Üchkilsa,and the Russian troops for over 5 days.Having suffered heavy losses in the battle,Russian troops left the church on June 26.Russian troops commanded by Sisianov attempted to invade Gamarli village,located on the Zangi River and having an advantageous strategic position.At that time,Armenians informed General Sisianov that the shah’s troops had already left Üchkilsa.The general sent a small troop and seized the church without resistance.At the same time,the bloody battle for Gamarli village between the com-bined troops of the Iravan khan and Abbas Mirza against the Russians continued.However,the Russian troops,having received additional help at the end of June,managed,with great difficulty,to invade Gamarli village,which was of essential strategic importance [see:74,225-227,261-266; 148,314-315; 320-321; 188,38].Iravan Fortress,built on the top of the hill at the bank of the Zangi River,had a weaker fortress wall on the riverside,compared to the other three sides.The other sides of the fortress had double walls.The fortress walls,built of bricks and stones,were both tall and thick.The distance between first and the second walls was 15 or 20 sajens*.The ditch between the walls was filled with water.The fortress had 17 towers.Only 20 of the 60 cannons placed in the Iravan Fortress were operational.There were also three cannons with short gun muzzle on the Iravan Fortress.The garrison defending the fortress consisted of 7000 men [74,267; 115,97].The Azerbaijani chronicles,written in the XIX century to Russian orders,for example,Mirza Adigözal bey’s “Garabaghnama”,reflected the heroic defence by the Iravan population.“The Qizilbashs (the troop of the Iravan khan and the Gajars state is intended here – editor)had barricaded the roads so heavily that the Russian troop had lost all hope.Even the Georgian dukes,who had arrived together with Sisianov,were taken captive by the Qizilbashs while trying to escape” [81,I,68].The Armenians had high hopes of this attack by Russian troops.Malik Abov’s son Rustam and Grigor Manucharyan were helping the Russian troops,together with their detachments of horsemen [178,150; 172,21].Aware of the betrayal of Armenians Mahammad khan Gajar and his brother-in-law Kalbali khan,leading the fortress’ defence,were keeping the inhabitants of the Fortress under close control.Mahammad khan Gajar positioned strong groups of guards on the fortress walls,headed by trusted men.He had even assigned a special password to recognize their own men at nights and he changed these passwords frequently [188,49].Contemporary sources also confirm that the Iravan Fortress was not only boldly protecting itself,but its defenders would also leave the 299 AZERBAIJAN NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES,A.A.BAKIKHANOV INSTITUTE OF HISTORY T H E I R A В А Н K H A N A T E THE RUSSIAN OCCUPATION AND THE RELOCATION OF ARMENIANS TO THE LANDS OF NORTH AZERBAIJAN * 1 sajen was equal to 2,134 metres.fortress,seizing every opportunity to attack the Russian troops suddenly from many directions and inflict heavy losses on them (26,document 1672,p.811; document 1673,p.812; 148,325).As a result of such attacks by the besieged defenders of Iravan,13 officers and 173 Russian soldiers were killed [178,147; 67,100].Archive documents mention that during an 8 hour battle between Russian troops and fortress defenders on the day that Gajars’ Iranian troops first arrived to help the defence on the 15th day of encirclement,the Russians lost 3 officers and 120 soldiers,and 6 officers and 200 soldiers were wounded [74,269-270].The desperate P.Sisianov wrote letters to the Khan of Iravan trying to resolve the issue with as few Russian losses as possible.However,his 6-month correspondence with the khan yielded no results.This being the case,P.Sisianov treated the last representative sent to him by Mahammad khan rudely,insulted him and the Khan of Iravan and demanded the return of treasure seized by the khan from the Üchkilsa Monastery,together with the Monastery’s captive bishops,David and Daniel,within one hour.After the khan’s representative returned to the fortress,Mahammad khan did not give any reply to Sisianov [115,97-98].Fully confident of the Fortress’ defence and considering the cooling weather,Mahammad khan was sure that the food and weapon supplies of the Russian troops would soon be exhausted and that roads would be impassable before weapons and food could reach them from Tiflis.All the measures taken by the Russian commandant’s office regarding food supplies were fruitless.Firstly,when,between August,22-26,a 100-man detachment under the command of Major Levitsky,which had been sent to Üchkilsa for food,did not return,a 250-man yeger detachment,under command of Colonel Maykov was sent to help them.However,in a bloody battle between defenders and invaders,20 soldiers of the Russian troops were killed and 50 were wounded,together with Captain Firsov 300 AZERBAIJAN NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES,A.A.BAKIKHANOV INSTITUTE OF HISTORY T H E I R A В А Н K H A N A T E THE RUSSIAN OCCUPATION AND THE RELOCATION OF ARMENIANS TO THE LANDS OF NORTH AZERBAIJAN [74,274-275].In late August,P.Sisianov sent Major Montrezor,* together with 350 soldiers and 3 cannons,to Garakilsa to receive the food sent from Tiflis [148,339; 178,153; 132,49].In addition,P.Sisianov ordered the starving Russian soldiers to search for grain in the area.The local population had poured the grain into big jars and buried it underground so as not to help the enemy.Although Sisianov had promised to pay 50 kopeks of silver to those finding the hidden grain,their efforts were in vain.At that time,Armenians,having joined the invaders,informed the Chief Commandant of the uncropped grain fields belonging to Azerbaijanis around the Üchkilsa Monastery.Nevertheless,this endeavour also yielded no results,as the population of Iravan had burnt all the grain fields before the invading Russian troop had arrived there [148,338-339; 74,272; 115,101-102].The Armenians living in the vicinity of the Üchkilsa Monastery took advantage of the Russians’ grave situation and sold the grain they would acquire to Russian officers at very high prices.Armenians were selling 1 pound of flour to Russians for 1 abbasi,or 34 kopecks,which was a very large amount for that time [74,272-273].With the launch of war against the invaders by the Gajars State,the fight against the aggressors expanded and took on a massive scale.The Jar-Balakan rebels,attack by the Garabagh population on Yelizavetpol (Ganja – editor)Province,occupied by Russians [177,372; 132,50] and other acts of freedom** shook the invaders’ position in the South Caucasus.301 AZERBAIJAN NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES,A.A.BAKIKHANOV INSTITUTE OF HISTORY T H E I R A В А Н K H A N A T E THE RUSSIAN OCCUPATION AND THE RELOCATION OF ARMENIANS TO THE LANDS OF NORTH AZERBAIJAN * Rustam,the son of a Christian malik Abov,having once betrayed Ibrahimkhalil khan of Garabagh and escaped with his family from Garabagh to Georgia,was Montrezor’s guide [178,150].** General Sisianov sent Semyon Behbutov to Gazakh Province to get some food for the starving Russian troops.This “Georgian hero” was captured by the rebellious Gazakh population and handed over to Gajars Iran [see:74,272].Major-General Orbelian,positioned near Iravan,ordered the Georgian dukes accompanying him to return to Tiflis with him because of the lack of food.On the way,they were taken captive by Naghi bey,head of Pambak.He killed most of them and sent Orbeliani and the others (among them was also Kachaturi,the sword-master,who was assigned the title of “famous advisor” by Sisianov)together with Duke Bagrathion-Mukhranski to Baba Khan [see:74,273-274].The Tiflis-Iravan road was closed by the rebellious local population,acting together with troops under the command of the Georgian governor-general Alexander Mirza and this deteriorated further the Russian troops’ situation in Iravan.Major Montrezor,surrounded 12 versts from Garakilsa village,was slaughtered,together with almost all his men* [54,241; 74,275; 132,50].P.Sisianov sent 20 Iravan Armenians,whom he had released from captivity,to the Fortress and demanded for the last time that Mahammad khan surrender the fortress [147,275; 74,275; 132,50].Having used threats,polite appeals and various promises of concessions to the khan,Sisianov was hoping that he would surrender the fortress until the last moment.The Khan of Iravan,a representative of an “ignorant” nation according to Sisianov,had put him in a desperate situation.Mahammad khan’s high military training and well-thought-out tactical manoeuvres demonstrated his outstanding merit as a political and military figure [see:26,document 1241,p.618; 132,50-51].The khan’s main force was comprised of patriots,those brave Azerbaijanis whom Sisianov treated with contempt.They were protecting their motherland against the Russian invaders and the Armenians who had joined them.On August 31,1804 Duke Sisianov assembled a military council** with the participation of Major-Generals Tuchkov,Leontyev,Portnyagin,Colonel Maykov,Lieutenant Colonels Simonovich and Baron Klot von Yurgenzburg and took the decision to raise the siege of the Iravan Fortress and recall the troops.On September 1 of the same year,Sisianov demanded of Mahammad khan for the last time the surrender of the 302 AZERBAIJAN NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES,A.A.BAKIKHANOV INSTITUTE OF HISTORY T H E I R A В А Н K H A N A T E THE RUSSIAN OCCUPATION AND THE RELOCATION OF ARMENIANS TO THE LANDS OF NORTH AZERBAIJAN * Only one Armenian managed to survive this bloody battle.According to his report to Sisianov,“they seized the cannons,took only 1 wounded officer and 15 soldiers captive and killed everybody else”.General Sisianov demanded that this information remain secret [see:74,275].** During the discussions,Lieutenant-Colonel,Baron Klot von Yurgenzburg stated:“An attack on the fortress is impossible,as we have got a garrison many times stronger in front of us – in the Fortress-and a huge enemy army behind us.Therefore,I suggest raising the siege”.General Portnyagin stated that a retreat would be quite difficult,because of the many wounded soldiers and lack of horses.Finally,after tense discussions,other council members also accepted the option of retreat [see:74,275-276].Iravan Fortress.The next day,Mahammad khan again rejected this appeal.Only after that,on September 3,did Sisianov order the retreat of Russian troops [26,document 1242,p.619; 178,154-155; 74,275-276; 115,104].The Armenians,having betrayed Azerbaijan and rendered all kinds of help to the Russian military during the invasion of the South Caucasus left their settlement and moved to the Azerbaijani lands occupied by Russia.Namely,malik Abraham and yuzbashi Gavri moved to Garakilsa,controlled by Russia,together with 200 families and begged Sisianov to “save also the 500 Armenian families living around the Iravan Fortress and unable to escape” [26,document 1256,p.626; 74,283; 172,22].The punishment of treacherous subjects by the Khan of Iravan was to be expected.Evidently,General Sisianov confronted obstinate resistance from Azerbaijani patriots protecting their native lands during this assault and failed to seize the encircled Iravan Fortress.According to one source,during the first encirclement of the Iravan Fortress,the Russian Commandant lost around 2000 soldiers [26,document 1682,p.815-816].Consequently,the tsarist troops,having recorded a shameful failure,were forced to retreat.Yet,this was a temporary step taken under constraint.Although the Russian troops gave up the encirclement of the Iravan Fortress,the invasion of the Iravan Khanate,which was of essential strategic value,remained the main aim of the Russian military.As a result,a piecemeal invasion of the Iravan Khanate was brought to the agenda.In late March 1805,the Shöreyel Sultanate,which was under the control of the Iravan Khanate and had important strategic and economic advantages,was completely occupied by Russian troops* [see:26,document 1672,p.572-574].303 AZERBAIJAN NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES,A.A.BAKIKHANOV INSTITUTE OF HISTORY T H E I R A В А Н K H A N A T E THE RUSSIAN OCCUPATION AND THE RELOCATION OF ARMENIANS TO THE LANDS OF NORTH AZERBAIJAN *Unable to accept the loss of Shöreyel,Mahammad khan Gajar of Iravan sent 3 thousand men there under the command of his warlords Gassim bey and Mahammadali bey.A bloody battle ensued between the troops of the Iravan khan and the Russian army commanded by Major-General Nesvetayev in the village of Great Talin.However,subsequently,the Iravan khan’s troops were defeated and retreated to Üchkilsa.Although the Russian troops pursued them,Major-General Nesvetayev ordered the Russian troops to retreat,having heard news of Mahammad khan Gajar assembling an additional force and preparing to attack [26,document 1672,p.573-574].Aware of Russia’s invasion plans,Abbas Mirza removed Mahammad Hüssein khan Gajar,who “was not regular in his foreign policy” and brought Mehdigulu khan Gajar to power in the Iravan Khanate [26,document 1256,p.626; 200,14-15; 188,113].In early 1806,Sisianov again decided to launch an attack against Iravan.However,his assassination during operations in Baku prevented this assault.In June of the same year,I.V.Gudovich was appointed Supreme Commander-in-Chief of the Caucasus to replace Sisianov and was assigned the complete occupation of the Azerbaijani khanates and their annexation to the Russian Empire [8,72-73; 39,187-188].At this time,the Iravan Khanate was suffering from domestic instability.Mehdigulu khan had raised the taxes,which resulted in a rebellion by the Iravan population against him [26,document 1256,p.626-627].In the summer of 1806,Mehdigulu khan Gajar was replaced by Ahmad khan of Tabriz and Maragha [82,5; 74,368-370].Ahmad khan of Maragha returned the population’s property plundered by Mehdigulu khan and undertook many construction projects and defence measures in Iravan.Despite gaining the people’s respect during his three-month reign,he died on October 17,1806 as a result of an epidemic in Iravan.This event deeply saddened the Shahzadah (Prince),Abbas Mirza [98,285-286; 74,380].After Ahmad khan of Maragha’s death,Mahammad Hüssein khan Gajar,who had been removed from power by order of Fatali shah,returned to the Iravan Khanate [see:27,document 792,p.421],but he could not continue his reign.Sources state that already,by December 1806,Hüsseingulu khan Gajar was in power in the Iravan Khanate [27,document 129,p.69-70; 74,456; 95,167; see:pic.1].At that time,the international situation did not favour Russia.The tsarist Russia’s aggression against the South Caucasus had aroused resolute protests,not only from Gajars Iran and Turkey,but also from France and England.In December 1806,the Ottoman State declared war on Russia.This caused a severe aggravation of Russia’s position in the South Caucasus.France sent officers to Turkey to conduct military training with soldiers and engineers to establish defence fortifications.304 AZERBAIJAN NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES,A.A.BAKIKHANOV INSTITUTE OF HISTORY T H E I R A В А Н K H A N A T E THE RUSSIAN OCCUPATION AND THE RELOCATION OF ARMENIANS TO THE LANDS OF NORTH AZERBAIJAN Military fortifications and fortresses were built in Turkey’s border regions,under the leadership of French engineers [115,106].Finding it difficult to fight wars on two fronts,Russia sent Captain Stepanov to Iran to conduct negotiations.According to Gudovich,the borderline between Russia and Iran was supposed to lie along the Kur and Araz Rivers,including the Iravan Khanate.However,French diplomats in Iran managed to close these negotiations [see:27,document 831,p.456-460; 178,268].In accordance with the France-Iran Treaty concluded in 1807,a group of engineers arrived in Iran from France under the command of General Gardan.Inview of Iravan’s strategic importance,some of them went to Iravan at the shah’s request and began reinforcement of the fortress’ defence.General Gudovich wrote about the large-scale reinforcement of the fortress by French military engineers:“The Iravan Fortress has two walls,a ditch and a soil barrier reinforced according to European military traditions.Canister-shell cannons,which have not been used by the local military before,have been erected on the hill.Due to French engineers teaching the people in Iravan use land mines”[27,document 467,p.254; 115,107-108].By the way,Lieutenant-Colonel Kochnev yielded to the Iravan garrison,was also involved in this endeavour on the eve of the Russian assault [74,462-463; 132,90].Gudovich’s letters to the centre say that the French engineers were also engaged in the reinforcement of Üchkilsa Monastery.The French even demanded that Gudovich leave the territories of Iravan.He wrote:“…The French have sent their engineers and officers to reinforce the Iravan Fortress and the Üchkilsa Monastery before my advance towards the Iravan boundaries via Pambak” [79,case 4265,p.17-18; 115,108].In another letter Gudovich stated:“the French are demanding that I leave the Iravan Province,whereas I have conquered these places by force of arms” [75,document 168,p.60-72; 115,108].Unwilling to concede the South Caucasus,Gajars Iran rejected the Russian offer of peace.Using this as an excuse,Russian troops launched a new attack on Iravan in the spring of 1808.The Russian troops,having trained for a long time to conquer Iravan,had built fortifications in 305 AZERBAIJAN NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES,A.A.BAKIKHANOV INSTITUTE OF HISTORY T H E I R A В А Н K H A N A T E THE RUSSIAN OCCUPATION AND THE RELOCATION OF ARMENIANS TO THE LANDS OF NORTH AZERBAIJAN Garakilsa,located in Pambak,as well as in such places as Darabash,Hamamli,Gajarabad and Gümrü,in order to prevent unexpected attacks by Iranian and Turkish troops from Iravan,Kars and Akhalsikh.In September 1808,Gudovich advanced from Pambak to Iravan with his troop of 6000,and 12 cannons.According to other source,the Russian troops consisted of 240 officers and 7506 cavalry.Over 500 Armenian cavalry also joined the invading army [151,209; 115,109-110].The army of occupation of Russia and the Armenians helping them each had their own interests in the invasions of Azerbaijani lands.The Armenians beginning to flow from Iran and the Ottoman Empire to the Iravan Khanate’s territories took advantage of the situation and aspired towards the establishment of an “Armenian state” in the western lands of Azerbaijan.Endeavouring to achieve their goal,the Armenians were providing the Russian Commandant’s Office with various confidential intelligence,sending different letters to the ruling circles of Russia,regarding them as their “saviours”,instigating the Russian troops to invade Iravan and noting that they were looking forward to the Russians’ arrival [26,document 1258,p.627].The Russian state,in turn,was using all the help,including the financial means provided by Armenians to establish an “Armenian buffer province” against the local Azerbaijanis and neighbouring Muslim states in the western territories of Azerbaijan after the Russian invasion of the South Caucasus.The Russian officers highly appreciated the “bravery” of Armenians helping them,sent them frequent letters expressing their gratitude and were quite benevolent [see:180,7-30,56-62,85-103].Understanding the fact that the Russian state would not give up its intention to invade the Iravan Khanate,Hüsseingulu khan Gajar began to take defence measures as soon as he came to power.He dredged and reinforced the ditch,surrounding the Iravan Fortress,beginning with the Zangi River in December 1806 and increased the number of troops protecting the fortress [27,document 424,p.232; 74,456].On the eve of the Russian attack on Iravan,the khan had already conducted further reinforcement of the Iravan Fortress in European style with the help of 306 AZERBAIJAN NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES,A.A.BAKIKHANOV INSTITUTE OF HISTORY T H E I R A В А Н K H A N A T E THE RUSSIAN OCCUPATION AND THE RELOCATION OF ARMENIANS TO THE LANDS OF NORTH AZERBAIJAN French engineers.Entrenchments were dug outside the thick walls of the Iravan Fortress and cannons were placed on them.Special land mines were used in the battles [27,document 467,p.254].The Russian Commandant’s Office was gathering information about the number of the Iravan khan’s troops via special agents [27,document 436,p.235].On September 26,the Russian troops arrived in the destroyed village of Abaran.Hüsseingulu khan Gajar left the protection of the fortress to his younger brother Hassan khan,with 2 thousand soldiers,and left the fortress with 4 thousand infantry to confront the Russian troops.However,the khan of Iravan was defeated in Ashtarak and forced to retreat.On September 30,1808,Armenians surrendered Üchkilsa to the Russian troops.The invaders were welcomed here with great joy [27,document 453,p.243].307 AZERBAIJAN NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES,A.A.BAKIKHANOV INSTITUTE OF HISTORY T H E I R A В А Н K H A N A T E THE RUSSIAN OCCUPATION AND THE RELOCATION OF ARMENIANS TO THE LANDS OF NORTH AZERBAIJAN The second encirclement of the Iravan Fortress and the shameful defeat of the Russian troops (October 3 – November 30,1808)Having seized Üchkilsa under Gudovich’s command,the Russian troops were positioned in Garabagh village near Iravan.Alhough Hüsseingulu khan set up camp on the bank of the Garnichay against the enemy,he was defeated in the first battle [79,case 4265,p.4-16; 115,110; 178,295-297].On October 3,the Russian troops under Gudovich’s command crossed the Zangi River and encircled the Iravan Fortress [27,document 450,p.244].Gudovich demanded the surrender of the city’s population and the commandant of the Iravan Fortress,Hassan khan Gajar.Duke Gudovich firstly turned to the Iravan population with a letter on October 4,calling on them to surrender voluntarily to the Russian troops,promising neither they nor their property would be touched.In case of resistance,he threatened them with unmerciful treatment.* Having been defeated by the Russian troops in the first battle,Hüsseingulu khan attempted to enter the fortress via an attack in the direction of Iravan.The khan’s goal was to divert the Russian troops from encirclement of the Iravan Fortress by sudden attacks from the side.However,Gudovich sent a military unit,led by Major-General Portnyagin to pursue Hüsseingulu khan,thus thwarting his plan [27,document 450,p.244; 178,298-299; 115,110].Seeing that an appeal to the Iravan population would be in vain,the Commander-in-Chief of Russian troops,Gudovich,ordered the seizure of strategic spots around the Fortress in order to bombard it**.Encountering severe resistance,the Russian troops managed to execute the order around midday on October 9.The Iravan Fortress,completely isolated on all sides,was bombarded by the invading Russian troop [27,document 453,p.244-245; 178,296-297].308 AZERBAIJAN NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES,A.A.BAKIKHANOV INSTITUTE OF HISTORY T H E I R A В А Н K H A N A T E THE RUSSIAN OCCUPATION AND THE RELOCATION OF ARMENIANS TO THE LANDS OF NORTH AZERBAIJAN * Gudovich boasted about himself in the letter:“Do not take notice of the previous unsuccessful encirclement of Iravan (in 1804 – editor),the situation was totally different then from now.…I will not only destroy the Iravan Fortress with the troop under my command,but I can even seize Iran [27,document 443,p.237].** On the night of October 7,a unit led by Colonel Simonovich managed to capture Tapabashi in the north,Borshov’s unit crossed the Zangi River and seized Mount Maghtapa south-west of the Fortress and Major Bukhvotsov’s unit took Mount Mughanlitapa,surrounded by gardens and located south-east of the Fortress [27,document 453,p.244-245; 178,296-297].Having succeeded in isolating the Iravan Fortress from the rest of the world,Gudovich wrote another threatening and inviting letter to Hassan khan Gajar,Commandant of the Fortress on October 17.* In his reply,sent on October 21,Hassan khan Gajar stated he would never surrender the Fortress [74,473].Hüsseingulu khan was trying to enter the city by breaking the encirclement of the Fortress and inflicting frequent strikes upon the enemy.Under the circumstances,Gudovich stopped the assault on the encircled fortress temporarily and sent a large military detachment against Hüsseingulu khan [27,document 458,p.248-249].The battle between the detachment led by Lieutenant-Colonel Podlustsky and the defenders of Iravan ended with the defeat of the latter.The khan had to retreat to the other side of the Araz River in order to protect his surviving forces.Having been informed of this,Fatali shah Gajar sent a troop of 5000,under the command of Farajulla khan,to help the defenders of Iravan.A frightened Russian Commandant’s Office sent Major-General Portnyagin with additional troops to help Podlustsky’s detachment.However,playing on the nerves of the Russian troops,Hüsseingulu khan evaded open battle each time [27,document 453,p.245].While Gudovich was keeping the Iravan Fortress surrounded,the Nakhchivan Khanate was invaded by Russian troops headed by General Nebolsin.Nevertheless,neither the conquest of Iravan,nor the deprivation of the Iravan fortress of water** could break the battle spirit of Iravan’s defenders.309 AZERBAIJAN NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES,A.A.BAKIKHANOV INSTITUTE OF HISTORY T H E I R A В А Н K H A N A T E THE RUSSIAN OCCUPATION AND THE RELOCATION OF ARMENIANS TO THE LANDS OF NORTH AZERBAIJAN * Gudovich told Hassan khan Gajar,the brother of the Iravan warlord,that he had defeated Hüsseingulu khan and they should not expect any help.If they surrendered the Fortress voluntarily,he promised to leave Hassan khan free and let him cross the River Araz,or Hassan khan could be appointed ruler of the entire khanate with the exception of Iravan Fortress and city,on behalf of the Russian Emperor [27,document 447,p.239-240].* *Cannon balls destroyed two towers and damaged the walls of the Iravan Fortress encircled by the invading Russian army and the Armenians helping them.Trying to break the fighting spirit of Iravan’s defenders,the invading army took an even crueller step.They obstructed the water flowing from the Teymur Spring to the Iravan fortress and deprived the people of Iravan of it.Yet,this plan failed,the brave defenders managed to redirect water from the Zangi River to the Fortress at night,under cannon fire [27,document 453,p.246].Although 40 days had passed since the beginning of the siege,the Fortress garrison and city population continued to resist the invaders heroically [178,299-302; 132,91].Seeing the persistency of the Iravan population,Duke Gudovich renewed negotiations with Hassan khan,Commandant of the Iravan Fortress and sent an inviting letter to him.In the letter written on November 12,he used repeatedly the phrase “respected Commandant” and asked him to surrender the Fortress to Russian troops [27,document 458,p.248-249].In reply to Gudovich’s demands for surrender,Hassan khan Gajar wrote to the imperial officer:“Whatever the cost,we are ready to fight you,not only inside the fortress (that is not so difficult!)but also in the open.You should be aware that the fortress garrison has already made its decision on this” [27,document 460,p.249-250; 178,301; see:end of chapter,document 1].In addition,the Iravan messenger delivering the letter to Gudovich informed him that the fortress garrison would not lay their weapons down until the last man in their lines was killed [151,222; 178,301].Despite Nakhchivan’s occupation by Russian troops,Gudovich did not dare to launch an attack to conquer the Iravan Fortress; he kept on corresponding with Hassan khan and demanding that he surrender the Iravan Fortress.Using this opportunity,Hassan khan Gajar gained time by rejecting the appeal and reinforcing the fortress even further [79,case 4266,p.1-2; 115,111; 178,301].The prolonged encirclement and lack of food was gradually exacerbating the condition of the Russian troops.Finally,Gudovich decided to seize the fortress with an attack.The attack on the Iravan Fortress was planned to take place at 5 a.m.on November 17,1808 [27,document 895,p.509].The Russian troop was divided into five columns.Four columns were supposed to attack from various directions,while the 310 AZERBAIJAN NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES,A.A.BAKIKHANOV INSTITUTE OF HISTORY T H E I R A В А Н K H A N A T E THE RUSSIAN OCCUPATION AND THE RELOCATION OF ARMENIANS TO THE LANDS OF NORTH AZERBAIJAN fifth was supposed to stand by as a reserve force.The number of troops attacking the Iravan Fortress was mentioned to be around 3000 men [172,26],while another source stated 4645 men [27,document 467,p.253-256].However,they confronted determined resistance from the defenders of Iravan,who began firing cannons as soon as the battle began and forced the Russians to retreat.The steps built by Russian troops to climb the fortress were not enough to enter it.Finally,the Russian troops,having lost around 1000 men,had to stop the attack [41,part III,390].According to another source,of the Russian troops,17 officers and 269 soldiers were killed,64 officers and 829 soldiers were wounded [27,document 467,p.256].Assured of the impossibility of entering the city,Gudovich gave up the siege of Iravan and ordered the Russian troops to return to Tiflis early in the morning,on November 30.On December 1,the Russian troops entrenched in Nakhchivan were also forced to leave [27,document 895,p.509,510; 178,304-305].Despite being written by order of the Russian Empire,the authors of the “Garabaghnama” also mention that Russian troops failed to achieve anything during the encirclement of Iravan and “returned to Darüssürur (Tiflis)beating the drums of retreat without succeeding in their intentions” [8,I,75; 8,II,55].Thus,the defenders of the Iravan Fortress,arisen to protect the freedom of the Motherland,imposed a shameful defeat on the tsarist generals Sisianov and Gudovich,one after the other.The defeated Russian troops also suffered heavy losses during the attack on the Iravan Fortress.Gudovich’s report to the tsar reduces the number of losses,informing him of the deaths of only 17 officers and 269 soldiers and the wounding of 64 officers and 829 soldiers [27,document 467; 132,92].N.Dubrovin’s records also confirm the brilliant triumph of the people of Iravan over the Russian troops.he wrote:“…regiments 311 AZERBAIJAN NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES,A.A.BAKIKHANOV INSTITUTE OF HISTORY T H E I R A В А Н K H A N A T E THE RUSSIAN OCCUPATION AND THE RELOCATION OF ARMENIANS TO THE LANDS OF NORTH AZERBAIJAN (regiments of the Russian army – editor)were in such a condition that it was pointless to even think about another attack” [151,224; 132,92; 178,304].Due to attacks by Azerbaijani patriots and a heavy snowfall,the Russian troops retreated,losing another 1000 men [178,305].By the way,even Armenian writers admitted the bravery of Hassan khan Gajar,the brother of the Khan of Iravan.In reply to the Commander-in-Chief’s repeated demands to surrender the fortress,Hassan khan Gajar wrote:“…You are demanding that I voluntarily surrender the Iravan Fortress and,in return,you will give the Iravan Khanate to me.If such an action is good,then you should start serving the Iranian ruler to attain Iravan,Tabriz and other khanates in return” [74,473; 178,298].Having lost hope of conquering Iravan,Gudovich instructed General Nebolsin,retreating from Nakhchivan,to take those willing to leave,together with the Russian troops,(meaning the Armenians who betrayed Azerbaijan – editor)to Garabagh [27,document 462,p.250-251].This assault costed the Russian troops very dearly and almost half of those participating in the military operations were killed.Thus,having suffered a shameful defeat in the second assault of Russian troops against Iravan and also achieving nothing from an assault on Guba,Gudovich was replaced by Tormasov,of Armenian origin,in February 1809 [39,191].The Russian defeats in the South Caucasus drove the British to expand their activity in the region.Willing to launch a campaign against the Russian Empire,they began playing an important role in Iran’s foreign policy.With this purpose,a group of British military experts arrived in Iravan via Turkey.Upon their insistent requests,Hüsseingulu khan of Iravan attacked Georgia with a troop of 20 thousand from Turkish territory.However,he could not achieve success in this assault [see:28,document 1112,p.725; 28,document 1127,736; 115,112].312 AZERBAIJAN NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES,A.A.BAKIKHANOV INSTITUTE OF HISTORY T H E I R A В А Н K H A N A T E THE RUSSIAN OCCUPATION AND THE RELOCATION OF ARMENIANS TO THE LANDS OF NORTH AZERBAIJAN In April 1810,negotiations between Russia and Gajars Iran commenced in Askaran at the shah’s proposal [178,160].During the negotiations,Russia claimed the Nakhchivan and Iravan Khanates,while Iran claimed the Lankaran Khanate.At the time of these negotiations,Russia began plundering and destructive military assaults against Iravan in order to force the Khan of Iravan into its control.The most horrible methods and means were applied in these assaults.An instruction of the Commander-in-Chief to Lisanevich,who was preparing for one such assault read:“Commit such dreadful acts and destruction during this expedition that they never forget it.Take as many families captive as possible” [29,document 170,p.120; see:end of chapter,document 2].Such an instruction was also assigned to Jorayev [28,document 666,p.478].Attacking suddenly with 4 detachments and 200 horsemen,Lisanevich fulfilled the instruction “decently” within 10 days:due to the vandalism of the tsarist Russian army,many people from the peaceful population were killed and villages were razed to the ground.The population,having witnessed this vandalism,abandoned their houses everywhere and ran in terror to the mountains and to the other side of the Araz River,upon hearing of the arrival of the Russian army [29,document 172,p.122].In March 1813,Colonel Pestel launched another assault on Iravan.Attacking with a huge military force and 6 cannons,the Russian troops inflicted grave damage on the khanate’s population.The Commander-in-Chief rewarded Pestel with the Second Grade Order of Anna for his “valour” in the assault [74,616-617].Despite all these bloody invasive assaults and all kinds of assistance provided by Armenians,Russia failed yet again to subjugate the Iravan Khanate.The peace negotiations between the Russian state and the shah’s representatives commenced in Garabagh – in a Gülüstan village on the 313 AZERBAIJAN NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES,A.A.BAKIKHANOV INSTITUTE OF HISTORY T H E I R A В А Н K H A N A T E THE RUSSIAN OCCUPATION AND THE RELOCATION OF ARMENIANS TO THE LANDS OF NORTH AZERBAIJAN bank of the Zeyva River on September 27,1813.The Gajars were represented by Mirza Abülhassan Shirazi and the Russian side by the Commander-in-Chief of Russia in the Caucasus,Nikolai Rtishev.Finally,on October 12 (23 according to the new style),a peace treaty containing 11 articles was concluded [29,document 879,p.736; 29,document 883,p.739-747].Iran conceded the independent khanates of Azerbaijan located northward from the Araz River (except for the Iravan and Nakhchivan Khanates)having no legal right to do so.Thus,the Azerbaijani territories were divided between two invading empires without consideration of the will of the Azerbaijani nation.This was the first division of Azerbaijani lands between Gajars Iran and Russia.The main reason why Russia failed to attain the Iravan and Nakhchivan Khanates in the Gülüstan Treaty was the heroic struggle of Azerbaijani patriots,the local population of these khanates,against the invaders.314 AZERBAIJAN

Picture 1.The Iravan Khan Husseingulu khan Gajar (1806-1827)Source:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hossein_khan_sardar (This picture has now been “excluded” from the site)The occupation of the Iravan Khanate by the Russian Empire 8 The Iravan Khanate was undergoing a grave political crisis on theeve of the second Russian-Iranian war (1826-1828).Despite this,the khanate had achieved significant progress in trade just before the Russian occupation [95,873-874].According to a source,“While over 57 thousand pounds of cotton were produced during the Sardar’s reign,currently only around 1500 pounds are produced [71,part I,51]”.The goods exported from Iravan were bringing in 300 thousand silver roubles per year [71,part IV,284].This was primarily related to the fact that the khanate had managed to maintain its independence for a longer period than the other Azerbaijani khanates.* The unflinching courage and spirit of freedom of the Azerbaijani people in their struggle against the Russian invaders during the occupation of the Iravan Khanate is plainly referenced in a report by Marquis Paulugchin,Commander-in-Chief of Russian troops in the Caucasus,dated February 22,1812,to the Russian Empire,some time near the end of the first Russian-Iranian war (1804-1812).He wrote:“My conscience has entrusted me with the holy task of bringing to Your Excellency’s notice that the numerous manifestations of a spirit of freedom among the local population in 1802,… as well as in 1804 during Sisianov’s time,during his attack on Iravan and finally now,for the third time,are obvious proofs of the fact that the local population of these lands are not inclined towards Russian authority…” [29,document 88,pages 59-60; see:end of chapter,document 1].In addition to the above-mentioned,it should be mentioned that the Armenians amounting to a quite insignificant portion of the population,principally the Gregorian Church and Armenian merchants,were 325 AZERBAIJAN NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES,A.A.BAKIKHANOV INSTITUTE OF HISTORY T H E I R A В А Н K H A N A T E THE RUSSIAN OCCUPATION AND THE RELOCATION OF ARMENIANS TO THE LANDS OF NORTH AZERBAIJAN * While other khanates of Azerbaijan located on the north side of the River Araz were annexed to Russia in accordance with the Treaty of Gülustan in 1813,the Iravan and Nakhchivan Khanates managed to maintain their independence.betraying the state they had inhabited by assisting the invading Russian troops by all means,providing them with food and money,as well as by spreading conspiracies and spying for them.For example,the records of a high-ranking Russian official describing the anti-Azerbaijani espionage activities of Archbishop Nerses,who was considered second in line after the Catholicos in the Armenian Church hierarchy of the Üchkilsa Monastery,are further proof of this fact.The Russian official wrote:“Archbishop Nerses has repeatedly helped us to obtain information about the Iravan Khanate’s conditions,conveyed to us the events taking place there via his trusted men and informed us in advance of all the enemy’s intentions (the Khan of Iravan – editor)[29,document 523,pages 443-444].The political instability facing the khanate in the early XIX century had a negative impact on its economic conditions.The large-scale mili-tary operations,destruction,pillaging and looting by Russian troops had struck a heavy blow to the khanate’s economy.Suffering from economic deprivations,part of the population was forced to leave their native land to find shelter in less dangerous places.All of these factors had shattered the khanate’s economic,military and political power.Sometimes the khan himself was forced to move people from one place to another with all their property in order to protect them from slaughter and looting [82,40-41; 93,231; 177,334].Nevertheless,the Iravan Khanate was still the strongest of all the Azerbaijani khanates at the beginning of the XIX century.Therefore,in July 1816 the Emperor wrote to Yermolov,Commander-in-Chief of Russian troops in the Caucasus:” It would be good if the Iranian shah would exchange Iravan and Nakhchivan for the territories occupied by us 326 AZERBAIJAN NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES,A.A.BAKIKHANOV INSTITUTE OF HISTORY T H E I R A В А Н K H A N A T E THE RUSSIAN OCCUPATION AND THE RELOCATION OF ARMENIANS TO THE LANDS OF NORTH AZERBAIJAN stretching southwards from the Araz.Yet,considering the obstinacy displayed by the Iranian side in yielding these territories to us,we cannot hope they will ever agree to this” [93,12-13].As is known,the Emperor Nicolas I,just like his predecessors,kept the conquest of Iravan in his focus of attention and frequently reminded Yermolov of this fact [93,122; 175,410-411].The Khan of Iravan was waiting for the right time to attack Tiflis in order to regain the Azerbaijani lands occupied by Georgian dukes at the beginning of the XIX century with Russian help,and steal a march on the enemy.Hence,as both sides were preparing for war,Azerbaijan was building its forces and relationships were deteriorating.Firstly,the Russian Headquarter’s Office sent military engineers to the Qil,Zod and Göycha regions claiming that certain areas in the east of the khanate belonged to Russia.Nevertheless,a decisive response from the Khan of Iravan forced them to give up this idea [30,document 1370-1371,page 892; 132,162; 58,40-42].Finally,in the spring of 1826,the Russian Headquarters decided to attack Shirak (Mirak*)[132,162].Thus began a new Russian campaign of attack against the Iravan Khanate.Concerned about the Russian troops gradually approaching the centre of the Iravan Khanate,the khan assembled his troops on the border.His border troops were placed in the following positions:a cavalry division of over 1000 men near Lake Göycha; 1000 Garapapag cavalry in front of the Baligchay station; two infantry regiments headed by Hüsseingulu khan Gajar himself,6 cannon and 3000 cavaliers; 5000 cavalry headed by the Iravani warlord’s brother,Hassan khan Gajar in Adiyaman (on the 327 AZERBAIJAN NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES,A.A.BAKIKHANOV INSTITUTE OF HISTORY T H E I R A В А Н K H A N A T E THE RUSSIAN OCCUPATION AND THE RELOCATION OF ARMENIANS TO THE LANDS OF NORTH AZERBAIJAN * Some documents collected by the Caucasian Commission of Archaeography refer mistakenly to an area in the Iravan Khanate called Shirak as Mirak [30,document 13/4,etc.]; the mistake was also repeated in other sources published later [60,179; 177,32,36; 59,105; 93,37,etc.].A contemporary source of the khanate period – “Jambr”-cites the name correctly,as “Shirak” [105,191].way from Tabriz to Gümrü)[59,105].Frightened by all this,the Armenians living in Dalijan* began to flee.In his records,Seversamidze,commander of the Russian border troops,wrote,in comparing Armenians and Azerbaijani Turks,that Armenians could not survive on those soldierless borders without the Tatars (ie.without Azerbaijanis – editor).…Unlike the Tatars,Armenians are more useful and loyal in peaceful times [30,document 1372,page 892; see:end of chapter,docu-ment 2]”.On 16th July 1826,the Iravan Khan’s troop counter attacked and entered Shirak,while his brother Hassan khan’s forces entered Shöreyel.Having suffered heavy losses,the Russians were forced to retreat.“The Ravan warlord and his brother Hassan khan freed the Abaran Fortress and sabred the Russians who had escaped to Garakilsa.The region’s population was moved to Ravan,while some villages of the Gümru uezd were moved to Ajam.The princes decided to attack Tiflis [20,111-112].On July 16,the Khan of Iravan crossed the border with a troop of 5000 men and made the commander of the Tiflis infantry detachment,Duke Seversamidze,retreat from the Shirak camp to the Gümrü station [93,37; 59,104].The Baligchay,Sadaghachay,Garakilsa and other guardian sta-tions seized by the Russian troops were destroyed.Hassan khan’s troops took control of the Gümrü Road.Soon Pambak and Shöreyel were cleared of enemies.This fact was confirmed by Mirza Adigözal bey in his chronicles,even though he was writing under Russian government orders:“After Duke Savirza Mirza (Seversamidze)left Pambak and Shöreyel,Hüssein and Hassan khan arrived from Iravan,burnt the buildings belonging to the Russian government and acquired the territories” [8,I,81-82]”.In reality,as mentioned above,Seversamidze 328 AZERBAIJAN NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES,A.A.BAKIKHANOV INSTITUTE OF HISTORY T H E I R A В А Н K H A N A T E THE RUSSIAN OCCUPATION AND THE RELOCATION OF ARMENIANS TO THE LANDS OF NORTH AZERBAIJAN * The toponym “Dalijan” belonging to Azerbaijani Turks was later distorted by Armenians and shaped into “Dilijan”.The name is presented as “Dalijan” even on a map prepared by the Russian Empire at he beginning of the XX century [see:end of chapter,map 1].was driven out of Pambak and Shöreyel and the people of Iravan regained their native Azerbaijani lands.In general,as a result of the battles raging from 16th July until 21st September for the liberation of Pambak and Shöreyel under the Iravan Khan’s leadership,92 Russian soldiers were killed,2 officers and 37 infantry were wounded and 2 officers and 25 infantry were taken captive [146,143-144].Thus,on 19th July 1826,the Second Russian-Iranian War was launched.Refusing to be reconciled to the loss of former positions and with the Iravan Khan’s troops nearing the Georgian borders,General Yermolov,Commander-in-Chief of Russian troops in the Caucasus,sent a new military detachment to the Baligchay station.However,the detachment of 166 men was encircled by the khan’s cavalry on July 26 and almost totally destroyed.113 were killed,18 were taken captive,including the detachment’s commander and the others were forced to flee the battlefield [177,47-50].The Russians attributed the defeat to soldiers in the detachment from Gazakh (Azerbaijani mahal-editor)who had joined the Russian military service; the Russians claimed they had led Voronkov’s detachment astray,directing it right into the enemy,while some of them had raised their weapons against the Russian soldiers and the rest ran away after the first shooting [177,50].The military successes of the khan’s troops boosted the morale of the population of local and neighbouring provinces.Potto writes that after the liberation of Pambak and Shöreyel,“Borchali,Shamshaddil and Yelizavetpol openly betrayed Russia and the Russian ambassador was caught and detained in Iravan” [177,52; 132,164].In order to draw the aghas of Gazakh to his side,the Khan of Iravan wrote in a letter to them:“You were seeking to save yourselves and your families from the Russians when there was peace between the Russians and us… Now the 329 AZERBAIJAN NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES,A.A.BAKIKHANOV INSTITUTE OF HISTORY T H E I R A В А Н K H A N A T E THE RUSSIAN OCCUPATION AND THE RELOCATION OF ARMENIANS TO THE LANDS OF NORTH AZERBAIJAN time has come” (152,618-619; 132,164).This letter did its work.The population of Gazakh rose up.Snejevski,the police-officer in Gazakh,barely managed to escape with the help of a few Armenians [177,52].On 14th July 1826,the Khan of Iravan’s cavalry captured the German settlement once established by the Russian Headquarter’s Office on Azerbaijani lands near Tiflis and,on the night of September 1-2,Hassan khan captured the Greek settlement established in Lori with his 3000-man cavalry division [177,63; 93,84-85; 43,261].However,a section of the 3 Russian detachments and artillery based in Jalaloglu made them retreat and set off in pursuit.On the other side,the warlord of Iravan headed from Lake Göycha towards the Shamshaddil district to punish Russian supporters.General Yermolov advanced with his detachment to block him.The Russian military forces took the German and Greek settlements back [43,261] and these Azerbaijani territories were once again taken away from their legal owners.The Russian invaders thereby tried to create discontent between the Azerbaijanis,who were fighting for their ancestral lands,and the communities of Germans and Greeks.Having not yet been informed of the war launched by the Khan of Iravan against Russia and the banishment of Russian troops from the khanate’s territories,Tsar Nicolas I issued an order to launch military attacks against Iravan,assigning the number of troops to participate in the campaign.The order dated 1st August 1826 and sent to General Yermolov read:“Do launch an immediate attack against the warlord of Iravan.I expect the following reply from you soon:With God’s grace,the warlord is no longer and Iravan province has been occupied – You and the Russian army of 15 thousand are enough to gain victory” [55,214; see:end of chapter,document 3].Yet General Yermolov failed to carry out the order issued on August 1,as the Russian troops could not possibly have attacked Iravan by then,due to the fact that they had lost 330 AZERBAIJAN NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES,A.A.BAKIKHANOV INSTITUTE OF HISTORY T H E I R A В А Н K H A N A T E THE RUSSIAN OCCUPATION AND THE RELOCATION OF ARMENIANS TO THE LANDS OF NORTH AZERBAIJAN control over the entire North Azerbaijan khanates as a result of the large-scale national liberation movement launched against the invaders.Hence,the attack demanded in the Russian Emperor’s order was postponed.The Russian troops’ victories in battles in Shamkir and Ganja also impacted on the Iravan Khanate.The dispirited khan’s troops began to retreat.Pambak and Shöreyel were almost emptied again.The advancing Russian troops reached Jalaloglu on 21st September and built a camp there.The next day,the detachment led by Davidov launched an attack towards the interior of the Iravan Khanate.However,Davidov returned to his previous position on 29 September,following Yermolov’s orders,obviously because the latter had become more cautious after the bitter outcomes of previous attacks on Iravan [152,686-687; 93,87; 132,165].Since the Empire’s major forces were involved in the reoccupation of the rebellious North Azerbaijan khanates,a decisive attack against Iravan was not expected imminently.Attacking Iravan with insufficient forces was dangerous,as the warlord of Iravan (Hüsseingulu khan Gajar – editor)could counter attack,move behind the Russians and cut their con-tact with Georgia [93,87-88; 132,165],which would mean defeat for the Russian troops.On 21st October 1826,the Emperor wrote to Yermolov:“If it is possible to capture Iravan by force,by bribing the warlord of Iravan or by establishing secret relationships with him,do not miss the opportuni-ty”.The tsar was well aware of the importance of capturing the Iravan and Sardarabad Fortresses [see:end of chapter,pic.1,2] and often reminded Yermolov of this [93,122].In late 1826,Russian Army Headquarters developed two drafts for the next military campaign,taking account of Yermolov’s and Paskevich’s opinions.In Paskevich’s plan,Iravan and Nakhchivan were to be isolated from the rest of Azerbaijan by a strike on an unexpected area,while the major strike was to be inflicted upon Tabriz [152,687; 93,159-160,166; 132,165].331 AZERBAIJAN NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES,A.A.BAKIKHANOV INSTITUTE OF HISTORY T H E I R A В А Н K H A N A T E THE RUSSIAN OCCUPATION AND THE RELOCATION OF ARMENIANS TO THE LANDS OF NORTH AZERBAIJAN Yermolov’s suggestion was to be content with capturing the Iravan Khanate with existing forces and to use the Armenians supporting the Russian troops in the fortresses by arming them against the Muslims.The plan continued with the occupation of Ardabil,Khalkhal and other Azerbaijani provinces by passing through Meshkin province and subjugating the Lankaran Khanate.Tsar Nicolas I confirmed Yermolov’s plan and approved the idea of striking the main blow against the Iravan Khanate [93,157-166,205-208].In order to prepare for the execution of the plan,Chief of Headquarters,Baron Dibich,arrived in Tbilisi in February 1827 and went through the plan thoroughly.By decree of the Tsar,400 thousand chevrons,or 500 thousand roubles,were allocated for its implementation.Plenty of grain and flour was sent to Baku and Redutgala [93,166-170].Suspecting General Yermolov of communicating with the Decembrists,Nicolas I soon released him from the post of Commander-in-Chief of Russian Troops in the Caucasus.In late March 1827,General I.F.Paskevich,having maintained his loyalty to the Tsar,was appointed the Commander-in-Chief of Russian Troops in the Caucasus (1827-1831)[93,226,228-229; 177,283; 172,38-39].As the new Commander-in-Chief fully appreciated the strategic importance of the Iravan Khanate,he decided to strike the first blow there.On 26th March 1827,Baron Dibich announced the launch of military operations against the Iravan Khanate.At the beginning of April,the vanguard of Russian troops set off from Borchali to Iravan under the command of General Benkendorf,accompanied by the Armenian Archbishop Nerses Ashtarakli [32,document 214,pages 258-260; 177,287; 93,222-223,229-230,233; 137,12; 132,166].On April 11,Benkendorf approached Sudakan,located 40 versts from Üchkilsa.The Russians encountered unfavourable conditions here.The entire popula-332

of Iravan had been moved southward from the River Araz and the khanate’s territory had been emptied; it was impossible to provision the Russian troops with food [93,231].Although the Russian commandant arrived at Üchkilsa Monastery on 13th April without resistance and was solemnly welcomed by the Armenians living there,Benkendorf soon understood the difficult situation he was in the Armenian’s deceit.* The starving Russian soldiers had even begun to eat plant roots [32,document 214,pages 258-259].The first siege of the Sardarabad Fortress by Russian invaders and its heroic defence (April 16-17,1827)Facing a dead end,Benkendorf moved from Üchkilsa Monastery to Sardarabad on April 16.The Sardarabad Fortress was surrounded by dry ditches and had 22 cannon.The fortress had a 3000-man garrison.The chief of the fortress was the brother of the Iravan warlord,Hassan khan,and his grandson (Fatali khan – editor)[59,28].Although General Benkendorf,attempting to seize the Sardarabad Fortress by a surprise strike,attacked it with 5 detachments and 4 cannon on 16th April,he managed to approach the fortress,secretly,only in the evening.** However,the fortress’ defenders became aware of the Russians’s 333 AZERBAIJAN NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES,A.A.BAKIKHANOV INSTITUTE OF HISTORY T H E I R A В А Н K H A N A T E THE RUSSIAN OCCUPATION AND THE RELOCATION OF ARMENIANS TO THE LANDS OF NORTH AZERBAIJAN * General Benkendorf’s unit was soon in deep trouble in Üchkilsa.Having commenced the assault with few food supplies,the Russian troop depended greatly on Armenian help to meet this demand.The Armenians,headed by Nerses of Ashtarak,had promised to help the Russian Headquarter’s Office,both financially and militarily.However,the Armenians did not render any help to the Russians [see:177,287-288; 175,part IV,409].Undoubtedly,the Armenians were,as usual,aiming to hurry the Russian troops into a fight against the Iravan Khanate.Later,in November 1828,General Paskevich wrote in a confidential letter that the deceitful promises,with which the Armenian Catholicos Nerses had tricked them,were directly responsible for the shameful defeats of the Russian troops [32,document 214,pages 258-259].** Having been duly informed of General Benkendorf’s military plans,Hassan khan Gajar confronted the Russian troops 10 versts from the Sardarabad Fortress with his unit of 1000 cavalrymen and,despite his defeat,he managed to disrupt the enemy’s attack on the Fortress to a great extent [see:93,243].presence,decided not to give them a chance and began firing their cannon.Recognising the failure of his plan,Benkendorf sent a messen-ger to the chief of the fortress demanding they yield.The chief of the fortress (Fatali khan – editor)rejected Benkendorf’s demand,answering “I would rather die under the ruins of the fortress than surrender it”.[177,304-305].Receiving this defiant reply from the defenders of the Sardarabad Fortress,Benkendorf ordered heavy cannon fire at the fortress on the night of April 16 to 17.Nevertheless,the fortress’ defenders responded with a counter-attack.In addition,attempts by the starving Russian soldiers to collect food from surrounding villages also failed.Failing to seize the Sardarabad Fortress,due to the bravery of its heroic defenders,the Russian troops again retreated to Üchkilsa Monastery on April 17 [93,243-244; 177,305].Although the Russian army,lacking financial resources,turned to the Pashas of Kars and Erzurum,their appeal yielded no result [93,245].Finally,a caravan of carts,full of food sent from Tiflis to the Russian troops,reached the camp on April 23.These reserves were enough to supply the Russian troops for 10 days only [177,306].Therefore,having solved the food problem,at least temporarily,the Russian troops hurried to achieve their main objective – to seize the Iravan Fortress and complete the occupation of the khanate.The third siege of the Iravan Fortress and unyielding stand of the fortress’ heroes against the Russian invaders (April 27 – June 23,1827)As the warlord of Iravan,Hüsseingulu khan Gajar,understood the purpose of the Russian troops,he had prepared well the defence of the Iravan Fortress.The khan had collected vast grain reserves in the fortress from the surrounding villages and had reinforced the fortress garrison.334 AZERBAIJAN NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES,A.A.BAKIKHANOV INSTITUTE OF HISTORY T H E I R A В А Н K H A N A T E THE RUSSIAN OCCUPATION AND THE RELOCATION OF ARMENIANS TO THE LANDS OF NORTH AZERBAIJAN The garrison only had 5 thousand soldiers and 26 cannon [59,28].Having faced Armenian betrayal numerous times,Hüsseingulu khan acted carefully this time and placed a garrison of 400 soldiers in the Üchkilsa Monastery,ordered that the church’s food reserves to be carried to the Iravan Fortress and that the Armenians be brought to the Iravan Fortress and kept under control,leaving only a few religious figures in the church [93,233].Hüsseingulu khan of Iravan assigned his brother Hassan khan to protect the Sardarabad and Iravan Fortresses and he himself defended the surrounding areas with his troop [8,II,84].Not wishing to lose time,Benkendorf placed 2 battalions headed by Colonel Voljensky,in Üchkilsa and left it on April 23.The next day,he crossed the Zangi Pass,moved towards the south-east of Iravan and captured the highlands.Many bloody battles took place between the defenders of the Iravan Fortress and the combined forces of the invading Russian troops,the Armenians having betrayed the Khan of Iravan,from 24th until 27th April.* After a fierce struggle,on April 27 a place located in the eastern part of the Iravan Fortress called the city suburb was captured under the command of Major Voljensky.Thus,the encirclement of the Iravan Fortress was completed [93,256-258; 177,308-310].Despite being surrounded on all sides,the defenders of the Iravan Fortress fought boldly.Thus General Benkendorf was forced to negotiate with Hüsseingulu khan through the chief of the Fortress,Subhangulu** (Hüsseingulu khan Gajar’s nephew and son-in-law – editor).The general first tried to subvert the khan with money,but seeing the hopelessness of this ploy,he promised the khan that,in the 335 AZERBAIJAN NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES,A.A.BAKIKHANOV INSTITUTE OF HISTORY T H E I R A В А Н K H A N A T E THE RUSSIAN OCCUPATION AND THE RELOCATION OF ARMENIANS TO THE LANDS OF NORTH AZERBAIJAN * The 500-man infantry unit,having left the Iravan Fortress to fight the enemy,entered into a bloody battle with their adversaries in one of the villages located near the fortress.Although the Iravan cavalry fought determinedly,the well-armed enemy seized Mughanlitapa Mount on the south-eastern side of the fortress.However,the fortress’ defenders shelled them heavily with cannons.On April 25,the enemy captured the “Irakli Mountain” peak following a bloody battle.On the same day,a military unit commanded by the fortress’ Commandant,Sübhangulu khan,attacked the enemy regiment positioned in the city gardens.The hostile regiment retreated.However,as the Russian troops received additional military aid,the Iravan fighters were defeated.[see:93,256,257; 177,308-309].** Potto presents the name of Sübhangulu khan as “Savatgulu” khan [177,309-311] in one part of his book,while in another the same name is noted as “Suvangulu” khan [177,514],and Sherbatov writes of the same person by the name of “Suangulu” khan [93,264].Yet,another source presents the nephew of Hüsseingulu khan Gajar and the Commandant of the Iravan Fortress as Sübhangulu khan [32,566].event of his surrender,the Russian government would keep him in power and his previous wealth would be returned to him.Yet,not only did Hüsseingulu khan Gajar refuse the general’s offer,he also preferred to continue the struggle.On the night of April 29 to 30,the Iravan cavalry suddenly attacked the enemy’s guard divisions watching the bridge over the River Zangi thus putting them under duress.The aim was to break the enemy’s encirclement and enter the Iravan Fortress.However,the heavy cannon fire of the Russian troop thwarted the attack [177,309-312].On April 30,Hassan khan Gajar tried to break the encirclement on the eastern wing with a 200-man cavalry troop and make contact with the people in the fortress,but the Russians prevented him [93,258].Benkendorf’s troop was already provisioned with food and,furthermore,had been joined by two regiments of Black Sea Kazaks,when he received a second round of military supplies sent by General Paskevich on May 1.Hassan khan and his cavalry were often seen around the Russian camp,but he didn’t launch a serious attack.The khan’s main purpose was probably to make the Russian troops restless and tired (93,260).On May 7,Hassan khan built a camp in the outfall of the River Zangi with a detachment of 4 thousand men.On the evening of May 8,Benkendorf left the camp together with two armed divisions of 1200 Kazaks and one cannon,passed the village of Ulukhanli at night and reached the outfall of the River Zangi in the morning.Hassan khan’s detachment was stand-ing on the other bank of the river.Benkendorf passed the river near the village of Sarvanlar and advanced to the khan’s left.While retreating towards the River Abaran,Hassan khan was attacked by Benkendorf’s Black Sea and Don Kazaks.Benkendorf pursued Hassan khan’s detachment and,according to his records,the khan lost 300 men,both wounded and killed.54 men were taken captive.Beys from Khoy and 336 AZERBAIJAN NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES,A.A.BAKIKHANOV INSTITUTE OF HISTORY T H E I R A В А Н K H A N A T E THE RUSSIAN OCCUPATION AND THE RELOCATION OF ARMENIANS TO THE LANDS OF NORTH AZERBAIJAN Garapapag,as well as the Iravan warlord’s father-in-law,were among the captives.The pursuit of Hassan khan was stopped near Sardarabad.The next day,Benkendorf returned to the camp.Hassan khan built himself a camp at Beybulag,located south of the River Araz,he raised cavalrymen from several local tribes and increased the number of his troop to 5 thousand men [93,261-262].The heroic stand by the Iravan Fortress’ defenders and the prolongation of the encirclement forced the Commander-in-Chief Paskevich,to come personally and lead a crusade against Iravan.That is,the troops headed by General Paskevich launched an attack on Iravan on May 12,accompanied by the Armenian and Georgian detachments which had joined them.On May 17,the first Armenian cavalry regiment,* established with Emperor Nicolas I’s agreement,followed Paskevich into the territories of the Iravan Khanate.Their number on the borders of Iravan had reached 1000 [177,323-324].This proves,once again,the magnificence of the Iravan Fortress at that time.Moving from Üchkilsa toward the Iravan Fortress on June 8,Paskevich began collecting intelligence about the fortresses belonging to the Iravan Khanate.The General learned that a garrison of 1000 serbazs(soldiers-trans.)and 500 archers from Mazandaran were based at the Sardarabad Fortress,there were 18 cannon in the Fortress’ gun-pits and they had food reserves for two months.Paskevich wrote in his journal of military operations about the Iravan Fortress:“The Iravan Fortress has two high walls with vaults,surrounded by a deep ditch.A narrow strip between the walls serves as another obstacle,just like the 337 AZERBAIJAN NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES,A.A.BAKIKHANOV INSTITUTE OF HISTORY T H E I R A В А Н K H A N A T E THE RUSSIAN OCCUPATION AND THE RELOCATION OF ARMENIANS TO THE LANDS OF NORTH AZERBAIJAN * General Sipyagin spoke proudly of the services rendered by Armenians in 1826 against the Iranians (the troops of the Iravan khan and the Gajars of Iran – editor).Therefore,paying special attention to the establishment of Armenian units,Sipyagin signed a special rule established for those wishing to enlist in the units on May 24,1827 [153,62-64].ditch.Cannon are placed in the closed vaults of the inner wall,while the outer wall is protected by falconets (light swivel-guns – editor)placed in loopholes and vaults,as well as by gun shot.The Fortress garrison consisted of 2 thousand sarbazs and approximately the same number o f irregular archers” [93,262-263].Paskevich believed that defences of the Iravan Fortress were quite strong and the high morale of the fortress’ garrison increased its importance even further.Paskevich was well aware of the failure of Sisianov’s attempt in 1804 and Gudovich’s attempt in 1808 to capture the Iravan Fortress [93,263-264],which was considered unconquerable,and he was not planning to repeat those failures.Having reached the vicinity of the Iravan Fortress,Paskevich learned that Benkendorf was conducting negotiations with Sübhangulu khan (Commandant of the Iravan Fortress – editor).He did not trust Sübhangulu khan,who was a close associate and subordinate of the Iravan warlord,but agreed to continue the negotiations,assuming the fortress could be seized without a battle.Several days previously,Sübhangulu khan had informed Duke Seversamidze of his wish to speak to the Commander-in-Chief of the Russian Troops.When Paskevich sent a message to the fortress commandant announcing his arrival,Benkendorf was very surprised to receive a reply,not from the commandant,but from the warlord himself.The Iravan warlord Hüsseingulu khan said to Duke Severzamidze:“If the conversation is not about the surrender of the fortress,I will allow the Fortress Commandant to meet with Paskevich.Otherwise,it will be meaningless – because I will never surrender the fortress” [93,264-265].After this,Paskevich ordered the cessation of all contact with the fortress [93,265; 132,167].Krasovsky arrived in the vicinity of Iravan with his 20th infantry division and two Kazak detachments.Here he was supposed to replace Benkendorf’s encirclement group,so that the latter could launch an attack together with Paskevich [177,449].338 AZERBAIJAN NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES,A.A.BAKIKHANOV INSTITUTE OF HISTORY T H E I R A В А Н K H A N A T E THE RUSSIAN OCCUPATION AND THE RELOCATION OF ARMENIANS TO THE LANDS OF NORTH AZERBAIJAN Due to the weather conditions,Iravan’s encirclement had already overstretched the troops.The baking heat of summer had begun,while disease had spread throughout the army.Paskevich reported that 240 men of the Georgian grenadier regiment encircling Iravan had fallen sick within one day.The lines of the battalions had become sparse and the number of soldiers capable of fighting was a little more than 400.The siege artillery had not yet arrived (the artillery left Tiflis only on 26th June).Therefore,Paskevich was thinking of giving up the encirclement,taking the troops to the mountains with food and water reserves,maintaining control over the roads and,when necessary,leading them quickly to Iravan,Üchkilsa and Sardarabad.* Having returned to Üchkil-sa,Paskevich heard that Hassan khan had crossed the River Araz with 3000 cavalry and sarbazs and was approaching the eastern side of Alagöz Mountain.Trying to prevent this,Paskevich sent a troop headed by Shipov against Hassan khan on June 10.Hassan khan retreated to Garajasar – the Alagöz Mountains-after hearing of the troop’s arrival in Bashabaran [93,265-267].Recognizing the impossibility of occupying the Iravan Fortress,General Paskevich decided to attack Nakhchivan and assembled his troops in a camp near Garnichay,located 25 versts from Iravan.However,he did not forget to take measures to reinforce the Iravan Fortress encirclement before attacking Nakhchivan.Lieutenant-General Krasovski was appointed Chief of the Iravan Encirclement Division to replace Benkendorf.** Paskevich positioned Krasovski’s division around Iravan and gave them the necessary instructions***:to continue the encirclement of Iravan until the weather became too hot and then,if 339 AZERBAIJAN NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES,A.A.BAKIKHANOV INSTITUTE OF HISTORY T H E I R A В А Н K H A N A T E THE RUSSIAN OCCUPATION AND THE RELOCATION OF ARMENIANS TO THE LANDS OF NORTH AZERBAIJAN * The idea of retreating towards the mountains came only from the troops attacking Iravan.Paskevich himself was planning to attack Nakhchivan with the main force [93,266].** The Iravan unit had around 3200 infantry,1200 cavalrymen and 16 cannons,while the main force had 4800 infantry,800 regular and 3000 irregular cavalrymen and 26 cannons [93,269-270].*** Paskevich instructed the Armenian Archbishop Nerses,who was expected to take an active part in the province’s governance in the future,to pay special attention to the grain harvest and watering the fields [see:93,273].necessary,to retreat to Sudakand.Paskevich warned that the actions of the Iravan warlord,especially of the Commandant,Sübhangulu khan,were aimed only at distracting Krasovski from taking drastic measures.Therefore,Krasovski should try to negotiate as little as possible with them [93,267-273; 177,332-333].The Russian troops set off on June 19 and arrived in Davali village on June 21.The village had been emptied in advance [93,273; 132,167].As mentioned,the warlord had moved the population to Iravan and placed guard units in some fortresses.Sherbatov reports that 18 thousand people were moved to the Fortress [93,322; 132,167].The strong resistance by Iravan’s population,the hot weather and the disease spreading through the soldiers,were aggravating the condition of the Russian troops surrounding the Iravan Fortress.Lieutenant-General Krasovski wrote in his diary on June 17 that he had over 700 soldiers in Üchkilsa Hospital [59,6].V.Potto confirms this – the weather had been very hot for two months and terrible diseases had spread among the soldiers.He states that there was no sense in even discussing the possibility of capturing the fortress without siege artillery,expected to arrive in August.Reporting the situation to Paskevich,Krasovski said the siege of the Iravan Fortress was pointless and requested his permission to raise it [177,449-451].According to Potto,when Krasovski finally received Paskevich’s permission to abandon the siege,he retreated towards Üchkilsa at midnight on June 21.The next day the fortress’ inhabitants learned of the Russian retreat and breathed easily after a 2-month siege.They were truly,extremely happy [177,451].Sherbatov reports that Krasovski was planning to raise the siege on the night of 22nd to 23rd June and move to Sudakand [93,275].However,in Krasovski’s own diary it is written that the termination of the Iravan Fortress’ encirclement was conducted secretly and the combined forces besieging the fortress retreated towards Üchkilsa at midnight on June 23,1827 [59,6].340 AZERBAIJAN NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES,A.A.BAKIKHANOV INSTITUTE OF HISTORY T H E I R A В А Н K H A N A T E THE RUSSIAN OCCUPATION AND THE RELOCATION OF ARMENIANS TO THE LANDS OF NORTH AZERBAIJAN Following the Russian retreat,Hüsseingulu khan attended to fortress reinforcement and did his best to this end.* Some rumours even said that the khan attempted to build cannon that would destroy more than half of the Russian corps with one shot,but there had not been enough molten metal [177,453-454].At the Nakhchivan Fortress,Russian troops confronted infantry units of the Gajars of Iran under the command of Hassan khan and Naghi khan.The Russian troops,superior in numbers under the command of Eristov,won the battle [115,118].On June 26,Nakhchivan was occupied.Having seized Nakhchivan,Paskevich began encircling Abbasabad with all his forces on July 1 [93,275-280].At that time,Hüsseingulu khan Gajar attacked Üchkilsa** [177,454].It seems that the Khan of Iravan was trying to draw the attention of Russian troops away from the Abbasabad Fortress,which they had encircled.On July 5,Abbas Mirza attempting to break the Abbasabad siege,attacked from Khoy,together with Hassan khan.Nevertheless,a battle in Javanbulag ended in their defeat.The fortress was swept by fire.On July 7,the fortress garrison surrendered.On July 8,Paskevich entered Abbasabad.On July 13,Major-General Saken was appointed Fortress Commandant and Chief of the Nakhchivan Province [93,282-287,293; 132,167].On 19 July 1827,Griboyedov went to Abbas Mirza’s camp with his chief translator,A.Bakikhanov.During negotiations,Griboyedov demanded the submission of the Iravan and Nakhchivan Khanates to 341 AZERBAIJAN NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES,A.A.BAKIKHANOV INSTITUTE OF HISTORY T H E I R A В А Н K H A N A T E THE RUSSIAN OCCUPATION AND THE RELOCATION OF ARMENIANS TO THE LANDS OF NORTH AZERBAIJAN * After the Russians gave up the Fortress’ encirclement,Hüsseingulu khan Gajar went to a mosque and prayed to Allah for having survived the infidels’ attack… The Iravan Fortress was very dear to Hüsseingulu khan,his 23-year-long battle memories and best days had passed in this very fortress [177,452,453-454].** On July 4,the Iravan warlord left the Iravan Fortress with 4000 cavalrymen and 2 sarbaz battalions armed with 2 cannons and set off to capture Üchkilsa.The warlord sent a letter to the Commandant advising him not to listen to Archbishop Nerses and to surrender the monastery.Instead of surrender,cannons were fired from the monastery.The warlord’s units encircled the monastery.However,several Armenians fled from the monastery and informed Krasovsky.As Krasovski headed towards the monastery with 2 battalions and 4 cannons on July 5,the warlord gave up the siege and retreated towards Iravan [177,454-455; 59,8].Russia and a military indemnity.Abbas Mirza suggested a 10-month cessation of military operations.The negotiations ended without result [59,6; 177,452-155].The Russian troop based in Üchkilsa was engaged in reinforcing the area’s defences until 1st July; they left a part of the troop there and built a camp 35 versts from Üchkilsa,in Chinqilli village,on the bank of the River Abaran.The Iravan troops* pursuing the Russians watched them from the valley of Alagöz Mountain,10 versts from the Russian camp [59,6; 177,452-455].Abbas Mirza gathered his forces (there were 10 thousand infantry,15 thousand cavalry and 28 cannons in his troop [93,301])and struck a heavy blow against the Russian troops in the Battle of Ushagha on August 17.The bloody battle continued from seven o’clock in the morning until four o’clock in the evening,finishing 2 versts from the Üchkilsa.Escaping from the battlefield,Krasovski found shelter in Üchkilsa Monastery.Abbas Mirza reinforced his position in Ushagha and decided not to attack [93,302-303].Records of the battle,by an author named Gizetti,say from Krasovski’s unit 685 men were killed,347 wounded and 134 taken captive[146,145; 132,167].According to Sherbatov,around 700 soldiers and officers from Krasovski’s unit were killed,almost 300 were wounded and the general himself was hit badly in the shoulder [93,303].Sherbatov says that nearly 3000 men were killed from Abbas Mirza’s troop.It seems that the the author recorded Abbas Mirza’s losses in higher numbers than those of the Russians.The losses of the Russian troops should have been higher since Krasovski’s unit ran away and retreated from the battlefield.Krasovski justified himself in this way:Abbas Mirza had reinforced his position in Ushagha so much that it was impossible to cross the area and return to the camp without suffering heavy losses.On the other hand,342 AZERBAIJAN NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES,A.A.BAKIKHANOV INSTITUTE OF HISTORY T H E I R A В А Н K H A N A T E THE RUSSIAN OCCUPATION AND THE RELOCATION OF ARMENIANS TO THE LANDS OF NORTH AZERBAIJAN * According to Potto,this vigilant and brave unit,consisting of people from Garapapagli,was headed by Naghi khan [177,455].had I opted for this dangerous move,this would have meant the imminent loss of Üchkilsa [93,303-304].Admitting the pointlessness of assigning Krasovski to continue the siege of Iravan after the Battle of Ushagha,General Paskevich wrote:“Even if Abbas Mirza attacked Krasovski again,he would hardly prevail in Üchkilsa Monastery” [177,481]”.Authors describing the battle wrote:“Having given up the siege of Iravan,Krasovski attacked Üchkilsa*.Taking advantage of the situation,the warlord moved to Üchkilsa with 4000 cavalrymen and 2 brigades of sarbazs.On August 4,Abbas Mirza was seen on the Üchkilsa Plain,together with his 30 thousand troops,and he captured Ashtarak village on August 6.They united,surrounded the Russian troops on August 17 and began killing them.Not including the 200 men taken captive,24 officers and 1130 soldiers were killed” [185,48; 177,457,469-478; 137,21; 132,168].This victory greatly hindered the Russian attack on Iravan.The second siege of the Sardarabad Fortress by Russian troops,its heroic defence and fall (September 14-20,1827)On 29th August 1827,the Russian troops in Üchkilsa chose the Sardarabad Fortress as their next target.General Paskevich was informed of the fortress’ abundant food reserves and its capture was vital to ensure the next moves by Russian troops [64,138].On September 11,General Paskevich set off for the attack on Sardarabad with the combined units and approached it the following day.Hearing this,Abbas Mirza retreated to Maku with his forces.The Sardarabad Fortress was protected by Hüsseingulu khan of Iravan and his brother Hassan khan’s own forces [32,document 518,page 561; 177,494].343 AZERBAIJAN NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES,A.A.BAKIKHANOV INSTITUTE OF HISTORY T H E I R A В А Н K H A N A T E THE RUSSIAN OCCUPATION AND THE RELOCATION OF ARMENIANS TO THE LANDS OF NORTH AZERBAIJAN *Uchkilsa was protected by one Russian unit,while Krasovski was heading there with his unit of 2000 fighters and a transport vehicle carrying food [185,48].On September 14,the troop commanded by Krasovski surrounded the Sardarabad Fortress [59,31].The Sardarabad Fortress,built by the Khan of Iravan 10-12 years before,* was situated on a large plain stretching from Üchkilsa to Alagöz.The double,high walls with huge rectangular vaults and gates made the Fortress quite strong and difficult to take.The fact that the fortress’ 2000-man garrison,armed with 14 cannon,was commanded by Hassan khan’s grandson – the young and inexperienced Fatali khan-gave Paskevich hope of success in capturing the fortress.Yet,the Iravan warlord’s brother Hassan khan managed to enter the fortress,raising the morale of its defenders and made them take an oath to die among the Fortress walls,but not to surrender it [32,document 518,page 561; 177,494-495; 93,315-316].Paskevich decided not to seize the fortress by an immediate attack,but by a properly organized siege and he appointed Lieutenant-General Krasovski Chief of the Encirclement Corps.Paskevich decided to launch the first attack from the fortress’ southern wing.Sardarabad was heavily shelled by cannon from September 15 and the fortress’ defenders returned their fire.On the morning of September 16,the siege artillery arrived and positioned around the fortress.The city was bombarded by fire from 24 cannon from September 18.After 2 days of incessant firing,the fortress’ garrison managed to break through the encirclement in order not to be taken captive.On the morning of September 20,Paskevich entered the fortress with his main force [32,document 518,page 561; 177,495-501; 93,315-317].The forceful action taken by Hassan khan had demonstrated his high skills as a warlord.Nevertheless,the fortress’ vast military supplies and food – 13 cannon,a full store,with 14 thousand quarters of grain,a lot of cotton fabric and many military supplies fell to the Russian troops [177,501-502; 32,document 518,pages 561-562,563-564].According 344 AZERBAIJAN NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES,A.A.BAKIKHANOV INSTITUTE OF HISTORY T H E I R A В А Н K H A N A T E THE RUSSIAN OCCUPATION AND THE RELOCATION OF ARMENIANS TO THE LANDS OF NORTH AZERBAIJAN * According to I.Shopen’s records,Hüsseingulu khan of Iravan had founded the Sardarabad Fortress in 1810 [95,255].to Sherbatov,500 of the fortress’ garrison were killed and 250 men were taken captive.By Paskevich’s calculations,the grain reserves obtained here were enough to provide the entire right wing of the Russian army with food for six months.In addition,a lot of gunpowder,cannon balls,cotton etc.was collected from the stores and 13 copper cannon were captured from the fortress walls.Paskevich wrote in his journal of military operations:“The supplies we have acquired here are priceless,without them,a further siege of Iravan would remain under question.Sardarabad was probably the reserve store supplying Abbas Mirza’s army with food [93,318]”.The abundance of reserves in the Sardarabad Fortress showed that the khan had prepared his troops for a long-term struggle against the foreign invaders.Yet the khan and his troops could not destroy the food and military supplies under the incessant cannon and squadron fire around the city.According to some sources,despite the shah’s intention to yield the Iravan and Nakhchivan Khanates after the fall of Sardarabad,Abbas Mirza did not fulfil his order to conclude peace with Russia [132,168].The fourth siege of the Iravan Fortress,Armenian betrayal and the fall of the Iravan Fortress (September 24 – October 1,1827)Despite the military defeats suffered by Gajars Iran,the troops of the Iravan khan continued to resist the invaders.The main focus was on defence of the Iravan Fortress.Having escaped the Sardarabad encirclement,Hassan khan reinforced the Iravan Fortress [177,505].On September 21,Paskevich saw the siege artillery off to Üchkilsa.The next day the entire unit was supposed to move towards Iravan.Colonel Khomutov was appointed Commandant of Sardarabad.The fortress’ garrison consisted of one battalion of the Crimean regiment,two cannon 345 AZERBAIJAN NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES,A.A.BAKIKHANOV INSTITUTE OF HISTORY T H E I R A В А Н K H A N A T E THE RUSSIAN OCCUPATION AND THE RELOCATION OF ARMENIANS TO THE LANDS OF NORTH AZERBAIJAN and Armenian and Kazak units (Russian military units-editor)[93,319].On September 23,Paskevich’s military forces built a camp 2 versts from the Iravan Fortress,captured Mughanlitapa Mount,located 750 sajens from the fortress walls,and started a control check of the Iravan Fortress.“The gardens of the Iravan Fortress,its minarets and vaults,as well as the internal buildings were visible from the River Zangi’s rocky bank.The fortress walls,with loopholes 200 sajens apart and vaults on each wing,stretched along the top of the steep bank.Proper attention had not been paid to Iravan’s defence from the riverbank and some parts of the fortress were destroyed.Yet the steepness of the bank and the river flow hindered any breach of the defensive line and its encirclement.The other three sides of the fortress were surrounded by a deep ditch filled with water and supplied with 50 cannon.The double walls,protected from the vaults and wings,spoke of the impending stubborn defence of the fortress garrison.The fall of Sardarabad failed to weaken the strength and activity of Hassan khan,who had taken over command of the Iravan Fortress after that fall.Using reconnaissance operations,Paskevich learned that the abundant gunpowder,cannon-ball and grain reserves in the Iravan Fortress could provide for its defence and the garrison’s food requirements for several months.However,Hassan khan’s brother – the warlord of Iravan,Hüsseingulu khan-had moved 18 thousand people to the fortress from the city of Iravan and surrounding areas.Only their medical-sanitary situation could worry the khan [93,321-322]”.Conducting a check of the Fortress,Paskevich decided to commence its encirclement from the south-east [93,323].The Iravan Fortress,with two tall towers,was surrounded by a large ditch and cannon were placed between the walls.The fortress garrison consisted of 2 thousand soldiers and 2 thousand archers.The food supply was intended to suffice for half a year [93,263].Certain of the impossibility of defending the fortress after its full encirclement,Hüsseingulu khan Gajar retreated towards Turkey with his cavalry.His brother Hassan khan Gajar commanded the fortress’ defence [177,492].346 AZERBAIJAN NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES,A.A.BAKIKHANOV INSTITUTE OF HISTORY T H E I R A В А Н K H A N A T E THE RUSSIAN OCCUPATION AND THE RELOCATION OF ARMENIANS TO THE LANDS OF NORTH AZERBAIJAN On 24th September 1827,the next siege of Iravan by Russian troops began.On that day,Paskevich positioned squadrons from Mughanlitapa to the right and cannonaded into the fortress all night [93,323; see:end of chapter,pic.1].Two squadrons bombarded the city continuously for 3 days.Incapable of withstanding the heavy cannon fire any longer,the fortress vaults fell.The canals deep under the fortress walls were filled with stones,by Paskevich’s order,in order to deprive the fortress’ defenders of water.At the same time,Paskevich demanded that Hassan khan surrender the Fortress.However,Hassan khan Gajar ignored the appeal,repaired the towers and prepared for the next battle.The fortress garrison subjected the Russian troops to heavy fire.Nevertheless,the invaders’ siege corps managed to bring cannon near the city.Having received no positive reply to his next appeal for surrender,Paskevich commanded the firing of over 1000 cannon-balls,from 40 cannon,at the Iravan Fortress.The city began to burn.Confusion and hopelessness spread through the peaceful population trapped under the destruction and the smoke of the burning city [177,505-511].The defenders of Iravan were also cannonading the enemy.Yet betrayal by the Armenians in the fortress and their liaison with the enemy deteriorated the situation even further.Armenian spies were contacting Paskevich and informing him of all the military secrets,including the position and number of the fortress’ defenders,locations of the cannon etc.Furthermore,the cannon-balls launched by them were not hitting their target,due to a lack of experienced gunners.Further,as some cannon were managed by Armenians,they were treacherously aiming the cannon balls at empty sites instead of at the Russian troops [84,36; 153,86].The Armenians outside the fortress were also helping the Russian troops to seize the Iravan Fortress.An Armenian named Nerses of Ashtarak had made a special appeal to the Uchkilsa peasants on September 27-28 to urgently help the Russian troops [172,44].In addition,the few Armenians living 347 AZERBAIJAN NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES,A.A.BAKIKHANOV INSTITUTE OF HISTORY T H E I R A В А Н K H A N A T E THE RUSSIAN OCCUPATION AND THE RELOCATION OF ARMENIANS TO THE LANDS OF NORTH AZERBAIJAN in Iravan city during the fortress’ defence were helping the Russian troops by all means.When the city’s population had left their homes as far back as in April 1827 and moved to the fortress,Armenians were placed in the fortress,isolated from Azerbaijanis [153,85-86].While Armenians were climbing on top of the Fortress walls and signalling their surrender by waving their caps [143,164],the fortress’ Azerbaijani inhabitants kept up the heroic defence of their ancient city.On September 30,the fortress’ encirclement began to tighten.Cannon were brought to new,closer positions.The Fortress’ walls were shelled with fire from all directions.On the night of October 1st,the Fortress’ defenders again launched heavy fire against the Russian troops,by Hassan khan’s order.However,this did not bring the intended result.On October 1,the Armenians inside the fortress established contact with the invaders,rebelled and demanded that Hassan khan surrender the fortress to the Russians.* Despite the khan’s efforts,Armenians opened the fortress’ northern gates to the Russian troops [32,document 523,page 566].According to Potto,the gates were not opened,although there were people on the fortress walls with raised white flags [177,512-513].Those who raised the flags of surrender were the Armenians,having betrayed the state they were living in.As mentioned above,during Iravan’s encirclement,Armenians had managed to contact Paskevich and informed the Russians of the locations of Azerbaijanis in the fortress and the best areas to be targeted by cannon [153,85-86].Taking advantage,Lieutenant-Colonel Gurko and Shepelev’s unit captured the south-east-tower of the fortress.After this,Krasovski,approaching the fortress’ northern gates,ordered Belov,who knew the Tatar language (Azerbaijani Turkish – editor)well,to tell them to open the fortress gates immediately.As soon as Belov uttered these words,a gun was fired from 348 AZERBAIJAN NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES,A.A.BAKIKHANOV INSTITUTE OF HISTORY T H E I R A В А Н K H A N A T E THE RUSSIAN OCCUPATION AND THE RELOCATION OF ARMENIANS TO THE LANDS OF NORTH AZERBAIJAN * Another source states that the rebellion occurred on September 28 and mentions that Hassan khan had rejected this demand [see:177,508].the fortress and blew his head away.This was the last ball shot from the fortress,by Hassan khan Gajar’s order.The gates were opened in a moment and the Russian troops thrust themselves into the fortress.According to one source,Iravan’s heroic protector,Hassan khan,[see:end of chapter,pic.5] had placed a burning fuse in the gunpowder tower in order to blow up the fortress at the last moment.However,Lieutenant Lemyakin saw this in time and took out the burning fuse with his own hands.At that moment,the garrison laid down their weapons.Hassan khan was in the mosque with his loyal people and continued his resist-ance [175,415; 177,512-513; 67,252].According to M.Sherbatov,the Russians entered the Fortress by breaking down its gates [93,329].With the help of Armenian treachery,the Russians prepared to capture a settlement called Tapabashi,located in the western part of the city,they crossed the River Zangi and positioned a squadron there… The fortress walls were destroyed on this side after exactly 6 days of encirclement and 6 guard detachments managed to enter the city [153,86].Having entered the fortress by means of Armenian betrayal,the Russian troops engaged in a bloody battle against the fortress’ heroic defenders.Hassan khan Gajar,having retreated into one of the mosques with around 200 nobles,still continued his resistance.Near evening,the Iravan Fortress was occupied by the invaders.Together with Hassan khan Gajar*,Commandant of the Fortress Sübhangulu khan**,commander of a special division Gassim khan,Jafargulu khan of Marand,Alimardan 349 AZERBAIJAN NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES,A.A.BAKIKHANOV INSTITUTE OF HISTORY T H E I R A В А Н K H A N A T E THE RUSSIAN OCCUPATION AND THE RELOCATION OF ARMENIANS TO THE LANDS OF NORTH AZERBAIJAN * There is little information regarding the further fate of Hassan khan Gajar,who had fought the invaders bravely to protect the freedom of his native lands and earned the title of The King of the Lions.Following the occupation of the Iravan Fortress,Hassan khan Gajar was sent to Petersburg – to Nicolas I-by Paskevich.However,a change in the political situation prevented his arrival in Petersburg.Hassan khan Gajar was detained on the way,in Ekaterinograd,located on the bank of the Terek [see:177,516].There are no records about the khan’s further destiny.**In a report given two days after the invasion of the Iravan Fortress – on 3rd October 1827,Paskevich mentions that Sübhangulu khan was also among the 6 men taken captive together with Hasan khan Gajar [see:32,document 523,page 566].Other writers indicate that Sübhangulu khan was soon found by Lieutenant Chevkin in a cellar [see:177,514; 93,329].khan of Tabriz,Aslan khan of Ahar,Fatali khan and others were captured.Also,all the cannon in the Fortress and weapon supplies were taken over by the enemy [32,document 523,pages 564-566; 93,328-330; 177,514].In addition,Hassan khan Gajar’s priceless sword,* decorated with gold and precious stones on the handle,which once belonged to the renowned Turkic warlord and ruler,Amir Teymur,also passed into Russian hands.V.Potto wrote down the statements of a person who witnessed the events,to describe the destructions inflicted on Iravan by Russian troops:“I was surprised to see the devastated walls and towers of the Fortress when I reached its south-eastern side.I think that Almighty God could not do in four centuries what the encircling artillery did in four days” [177,516; see:end of chapter,pic.3,5,6].The occupation of the Iravan Fortress,which had resisted the foreigners heroically on numerous occasions to protect the freedom of the native land,was met with great joy in the palace of the Russian Emperor and celebrated with a solemn ceremony.V.Potto described the event,writing that Nicolas I returned hastily from Riga to Petersburg upon receiving news of the seizure of the Iravan Fortress.On November 8,the Emperor held a ceremony of prayers in the Winter Palace Church,together with all members of his family.On the same day,the keys to the gates of the Iravan Fortress and 4 flags from the Fortress walls were taken into the city’s central streets and displayed to the people [see:177,518-519].Paskevich was rewarded with the “title of Earl for this victory” achieved due to Armenian treachery [93,330].Furthermore,Paskevich was awarded the First-Grade Order of Saint Vladimir for the seizure of 350 AZERBAIJAN NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES,A.A.BAKIKHANOV INSTITUTE OF HISTORY T H E I R A В А Н K H A N A T E THE RUSSIAN OCCUPATION AND THE RELOCATION OF ARMENIANS TO THE LANDS OF NORTH AZERBAIJAN * Amir Teymur had once defeated the Ottoman Sultan Ildirim Bayazid with this sword (in 1402 – editor).The sword,passed from Amir Teymur to the Safavid shahs,was seized by Nadir shah when he came to power together with other precious property of the Safavids.The sword was seized by the Gajars dynasty after Nadir shah,and had eventually reached Fatali shah Gajar.Fatali shah presented this sword to Hassan khan Gajar for the latter’s bravery in a battle against Turks.When Hassan khan was climbing down the Iravan Fortress on a rope,he asked General Krasovski to find his lost sword.The precious sword was found and sent to Nicolas I as a gift [see:59,61-62; 177,515-516].Abbasabad,with the Second-Grade Order of Georgy for the seizure of Iravan,gifts amounting to 1 million roubles for the conclusion of peace and the title of “Erivanski” for capturing the Iravan Fortress [177,591].In addition,special medals were introduced on the occasion of the seizure of the Iravan Fortress [see:end of chapter,pic.6,7].The invading general organized a “temporary government” in Iravan under Krasovski’s leadership.Archbishop Nerses was elected a member of this government for the “services” rendered by Armenians to the invading Russian troops.As noted by S.Glinka,a researcher in Caucasian Studies,“Krasovski and Nerses acted in collaboration” [46,34-35; 132,170].On 2nd October 1827,by Paskevich’s order,Russian troops held a parade of “triumph”,celebrating the occupation of the Iravan Fortress.During the parade,a large part of the Iravan Fortress walls collapsed,as if unable to tolerate this historic injustice and many invading Russian soldiers died under the rubble [177,517-518].After the occupation of the Iravan Fortress,the entire territory of North Azerbaijan was annexed to Russia.The Treaty of Turkmanchay was signed with the defeated Gajars Iran on 10th February 1828.According to the third article of the Treaty,the Iravan and Nakhchivan Khanates of North Azerbaijan,which were not included in the Treaty of Gulustan (1813)were also annexed to the Russian Empire [76,125-126-131; see:end of chapter,pic.4].Thus,in accordance with the Treaty of Turkmanchay,Azerbaijani territories were again divided between two empires – for the second time.The will of the Azerbaijani people,the actual owners of their native land,was ignored and Azerbaijan was divided between the Russian Empire and Gajars Iran.North Azerbaijan passed into captivity under Tsarist Russia,while South Azerbaijan passed into captivity under Gajars Iran.Before long – on 21st March 1828 (one of the days of the Novruz 351 AZERBAIJAN NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES,A.A.BAKIKHANOV INSTITUTE OF HISTORY T H E I R A В А Н K H A N A T E THE RUSSIAN OCCUPATION AND THE RELOCATION OF ARMENIANS TO THE LANDS OF NORTH AZERBAIJAN Holiday –

[76,272-273; 32,document 437,page 487; see:end of chapter,document 5].Hence,the foundation was laid for the future establishment of an Armenian state on Azerbaijani territories,as well as a new centre of tension in the South Caucasus region [163,37].352 AZERBAIJAN NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES,A.A.BAKIKHANOV INSTITUTE OF HISTORY T H E I R A В А Н K H A N A T E THE RUSSIAN OCCUPATION AND THE

relocation.In order to strengthen its position inthe South Caucasus and implement its future invasion plans,the Russian Empire began the immediate mass relocation of Armenians from the territories of Iran and the Ottoman Empire to North Azerbaijani lands in accordance with the Turkmanchay* and Adirna** Treaties.The relocation of Armenians to Azerbaijani territories was a part of the Russian Empire’s long-standing plans,aimed at establishing an Armenian state in Azerbaijani lands,going as far back as the early XVIII century.Intending to create a buffer Christian state on the borders of Iran and Turkey,Russia relocated Armenians mainly to the Iravan,Nakhchivan and Garabagh Khanates and other fertile lands of Azerbaijan.As mentioned in previous chapters,the relocation of Armenians,apart from Gregorian Armenians,into Azerbaijani lands,including the Iravan region,commenced after the Armenian Catholicate was moved from Cilicia to the Azerbaijani state of Garagoyunlu in 1441.*** Despite the fact that after the Armenian Catholicate was moved to the Garagoyunlu territories,the Gregorian Church acquired lands belonging to Azerbaijani Turks by various methods and gradually relocated Armenians to those lands,Armenians were always a small minority in the Chukhursad (Iravan)region.While considering the fact that information provided by Armenians to Russia and other Christian states of Europe * The Treaty concluded between Gajars Iran and the Russian Empire on February 10,1828 in an Azerbaijani village named Turkmanchay.At the Russian side’s insistence,the mass relocation of Armenians living in Iran to Azerbaijani territories was officially documented in Article 15 of this Treaty.** The Treaty concluded between the Ottoman and Russian Empires on September 2,1829 in Adirna.At the Russian side’s insistence,the mass relocation of Armenians living in the Ottoman Empire to Azerbaijani territories was officially documented in Article 13 of this Treaty *** Along with other Christian sources,Armenian sources also confirm that Armenians were not native inhabitants of these places.See:Chapter II.THE RUSSIAN OCCUPATION AND THE RELOCATION OF ARMENIANS TO THE LANDS OF NORTH AZERBAIJAN T H E I R A В А Н K H A N A T E AZERBAIJAN NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES,A.A.BAKIKHANOV INSTITUTE OF HISTORY 375 was always distorted and the number of Armenians was artificially exaggerated (the facts proving the absence of a settled Armenian population in the city of Iravan are presented in Chapter II – editor),even archive documents from the late XVIII century confirm that the Armenian population always constituted a small minority in the Iravan region.When,in 1783,P.Potyomkin asked why the Armenians living in the Iravan Khanate did not have the Catholicos’ stamp and signature on their letters,an Armenian representative replied:“Since the Catholicos is the religious leader of all Armenians scattered throughout the world,he cannot put his stamp on the letter of a group of Armenians – those living in the Ararat country” [214,107].Evidently,since the number of Armenians living on the territories of the Iravan Khanate in the late XVIII century was quite small,an Armenian author,V.R.Grigoryan,also admits this fact.Therefore,in their letters to Russia,Armenians intentionally and artificially increased the number of Armenians living in the Iravan region in order to hide their small number.For example,in a letter to Duke G.Potyomkin in December 1784,the head of the Armenian community in the Iravan Khanate S.Ter-Sahakyan wrote that he indicates the number of Armenians,which has been exaggerated many times in accordance with H.Argutyan’s (the religious leader of Armenians living in Russia – editor)instructions [214,109].The minority of Armenians in the Iravan region was contrary to the Russian Empire’s policy of creating a buffer Christian state on the Iranian and Ottoman borders.Therefore,the Russian Empire,having invaded the Azerbaijani lands located north of the Araz River,relocated Armenians massively into the former Iravan,Nakhchivan* and Garabagh Khanates,as well as into Georgian territories * Armenians could not stay permanently in Nakhchivan due to a resolute struggle by Azerbaijanis there.THE RUSSIAN OCCUPATION AND THE RELOCATION OF ARMENIANS TO THE LANDS OF NORTH AZERBAIJAN T H E I R A В А Н K H A N A T E AZERBAIJAN NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES,A.A.BAKIKHANOV INSTITUTE OF HISTORY 376 belonging to Azerbaijanis.This policy implemented by the Russian Empire was aimed at the establishment of a future Armenian state on ancient Azerbaijani lands.Russian authors also admit this repulsive policy.S.Glinka wrote about the lands to which Armenians were located:” …these lands… will gather the Armenian tribes scattered all over the world,and the Armenian Tsardom will revive in its glory and all its memories under the happy imperial patronage of Nicolas I” [46,92].The situation before relocation.Following the occupation of the Iravan Khanate,a new – Russian-system of governance began to be established on those territories.For this purpose,an entity named the “Temporary Governance”* of Iravan was created on 6 October 1827,by order of the Chief Military Leader of the Caucasus,Paskevich.The commandant of local troops,General Krasovski,was appointed his superior and the invaders’ associate,the Armenian Archbishop Nerses,was appointed a member of the “Temporary Governance”.The local population–Azerbaijanis-were excluded from the governmental board and patronage.Krasovski granted infinite powers to Nerses.The Armenians,having collaborated with the invaders,achieved what they wanted.A major part of 4500 chetvert (quartern-trans.)of grain,intended for distribution among the population who had survived the war,was allocated to Armenians,who were a small minority.Armenian ferocity soon reached such a point that it left even the general Paskevich dismayed.That is,in a letter sent to the chief of headquarters,Paskevich * Historically experienced in the creation of an Armenian state on occupied Azerbaijani territories,the Russian ruling circles repeated this form of governance after about 160 years,in an integral part of Azerbaijan,Daghlig Garabagh.On 12 January 1989 the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR adopted a decision “On Application of a Special Form of Governance in the Azerbaijan SSR Autonomous Province of Daghlig Garabagh”.Due to the measures taken by the Special Governance Committee,reporting to Moscow under the leadership of the pro-Armenian A.Volski,the upper part of Garabagh was practically removed from Azerbaijani control.The same method was also applied in 1828,during the creation of an “Armenian province”.THE RUSSIAN OCCUPATION AND THE RELOCATION OF ARMENIANS TO THE LANDS OF NORTH AZERBAIJAN T H E I R A В А Н K H A N A T E AZERBAIJAN NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES,A.A.BAKIKHANOV INSTITUTE OF HISTORY 377 did not even

leave the Muslims,(Azerbaijani Turks – editor)constituting three fourths* of the entire population,without patronage or necessary supplies” [32,document 438,p.487-491; 109,22; see:end of chapter,document 1].This new Russian governance caused large-scale discontent among the local Azerbaijani population.They began moving to other places,including to Ottoman territories and Iran,abandoning their native lands.The number of Muslims (Azerbaijanis – editor)having abandoned the Nakhchivan Khanate and the Iravan Qubernia,including the territories of Pambak-Shöreyel,reached 12.3-13.5 thousand [see:177,335; 182,112-113].Potto wrote about this:“The sedentary population** crossed to the other side of the River Araz.A small part of the nomadic Tatars left for Turkey and the remaining majority – for Iran” [177,334].General Paskevich’s report to Duke Nesselrod dated 27 June 1827,reveals that in the first half of that year,4500 nomadic (elat)Muslims left the Iravan Khanate.That is,800 families,consisting of Garapapaglis,who were Azerbaijani Turks,crossed to the other side of the River Araz,100 families of Garapapaglis and 300 families of Ayrims left for Kars and 600 families of the strong Ulukhanli tribe – for Bayazid to find shelter [32,document 512,p.547].* The fact that the chief military leader of the Caucasus,General Paskevich,having taken an active part in the difficult conquest of the Iravan Khanate and the intentional relocation of many Armenians from Iran and the Ottoman Empire to the region,admits that three fourths of the population in the Iravan Khanate were Azerbaijani Turks,even during the implementation of Armenian relocation,once again disproves the claims regarding a majority of Armenians in the Iravan region.** By sedentary population,V.Potto means here the native population of the Iravan Khanate:Azerbaijani Turks.This fact in itself is further proof that the ancient native people of the Iravan Khanate were,precisely,Azerbaijanis.378 AZERBAIJAN NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES,A.A.BAKIKHANOV INSTITUTE OF HISTORY T H E I R A В А Н K H A N A T E THE RUSSIAN OCCUPATION AND THE RELOCATION OF ARMENIANS TO THE LANDS OF NORTH AZERBAIJAN The gathering of an Azerbaijani population unhappy with Russia on the other side of the border disturbed Paskevich.Therefore,he was forced to exclude Nerses from the “Temporary Governance” of Iravan.After the Turkmanchay Treaty was signed,Paskevich also relieved General KrasovskI from the position of Chief of “Temporary Governance”.After that,he exiled Nerses,who was never tired of evil deeds against the Azerbaijani population,to Bessarabia [109,22; 172,72].The day after the Turkmanchay Treaty was confirmed (20 March,1828),Nicolas I signed a decree on the establishment of an “Armenian province”.The decree reads:“In accordance with the treaty signed with Iran,we order that the Iravan and Nakhchivan Khanates annexed from Iran to Russia be known as the “Armenian province” from now on and include it in our title.The Supreme Senate will receive the necessary decrees about the structure and governance of this province in due time” [76,272-273; see:end of chapter,document 2].The “Armenian province” annexed to Russia and created from an Azerbaijani khanate’s territories was divided between the Iravan and Nakhchivan provinces and the Ordubad area [32,document 437,p.487].The Iravan province consisted of 15 mahals (district-trans.),like the former Iravan khanate; the Nakhchivan province consisted of 5 mahals and the Ordubad area – of 5 mahals.The commandant of local troops,Major General,Georgian Duke A.G.Chavchavadze,was appointed to the position of Chief of the “Armenian province” [32,document 438,p.487; 109,23].Relocation of Armenians from Iran to the Iravan Khanate territories Preparations for relocation.According to Article 15 of the Turkmanchay Treaty,the shah’s government was not supposed to deter the relocation of persons who had betrayed their own state and served the 379 AZERBAIJAN NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES,A.A.BAKIKHANOV INSTITUTE OF HISTORY T H E I R A В А Н K H A N A T E THE RUSSIAN OCCUPATION AND THE RELOCATION OF ARMENIANS TO THE LANDS OF NORTH AZERBAIJAN Russians during the war (Armenians-editor)to the territories under Russian command.Thus,the Armenians living in Iran were entitled to pass freely into Russian patronage [47,339-341; 130,85-86].A one-year period was established for them to move and sell their property with no intervention from the Iranian government or local government bodies,including the imposition of any customs or taxes on such sale of products or property,and a five-year period was allowed for the selling or granti-ng power of attorney for the immovable property [76,130; 75,221-222; 461 44; 4,283].The project to relocate Armenians to North Azerbaijani lands was developed in 1827 in the diplomatic office of the South Caucasus headed by A.S.Griboyedov.The Ambassador of Russia to Iran,A.S.Griboyedov played an active role in the relocation of Iranian Armenians to the newly occupied lands of North Azerbaijan.A previous draft by the Russian government,stipulating the relocation of 80 thousand Kazaks to territories bordering on Iran,was withdrawn because of the relocation of Armenians to North Azerbaijani lands [79,document 923,p.1-16; 153,128,129].According to I.Y.Yenikolopov,A.Griboyedov paid special attention to the Armenian relocation from Iran to the Russian borders,i.e.the Chukhursad valley,and believed this to be a guarantee of the strengthening of the Russian position in the East [153,128].After General Paskevich took Colonel Lazaryev* (Gazaros Lazaryan**),who enjoyed particular authority with Armenians,under his command,relocation arrangements began in May 1827 [153,129].At * In order to implement the relocation of Armenians from Iran to North Azerbaijani territories in an organized fashion,the Russian Empire appointed Colonel G.Lazaryev,who was living in Petersburg,the Commandant of Tabriz on 19 October 1827 [46,40].This bloodsucking colonel,who came from a rich Armenian family,which had prospered in Petersburg and Moscow in the XVIII century by cringing to the Russian tsars,was an enemy,not only of Azerbaijani Turks,but of all Muslims,just like his brother Ivan Lazaryev,who was distinguished for his particular ferocity against the Turks in the Ottoman-Russian battles of 1787-1791 [see:74,649].** The Armenian version of G.Lazaryan’s appeal to Armenians living in Iran and intending to relocate to North Azerbaijani territories on 30 March 1828,provides the bloodsucking general’s full name [46,111].380 AZERBAIJAN NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES,A.A.BAKIKHANOV INSTITUTE OF HISTORY T H E I R A В А Н K H A N A T E THE RUSSIAN OCCUPATION AND THE RELOCATION OF ARMENIANS TO THE LANDS OF NORTH AZERBAIJAN the beginning of October,Lazaryev was a member of the group assigned to control the preparations of the Armenians living in South Azerbaijan.“Inspired” by Lazaryev’s appeal during the attack by Russian troops on Tabriz (13 October-editor),Armenians characteristically betrayed the state in whose territory they were living and opened the gates of Tabriz to the Russian troops.On October 19,Armenians rejoiced at the news of Lazaryev’s appointment as the Commandant of Tabriz [46,38,40].By the way,the “farsighted” Armenians played no insignificant role in the development of the Russian ruling circles’ policy of relocating Armenians to North Azerbaijan.The implementation of this policy was not a secret and was implemented openly.The Catholicos of All Armenians,Bishop Nerses,had promised his help in realizing the relocation plan [153,129].At the same time,Paskevich stated,in a letter sent in December to Sipyaqin,the Military Governor of Tiflis,that he wanted to relocate 15 thousand Aysors and Armenians living in the vicinity of Urmiya to Russian provinces.In reply,Spiyagin proposed relocating them to the Iravan and Nakhchivan provinces [153,129-130].Archive documents prove that the Iranian Armenians went to General Paskevich asking for his permission to be relocated to the provinces newly occupied by Russia [79,case 978,N1; 153,129-131].The significant factor is that Armenians,who were well aware that Iravan and Nakhchivan were Azerbaijani lands,were intentionally pursuing an objective of moving on an organized and massive scale to these very territories following the Russian invasions.Immediately after the Turkmanchay Treaty was signed – on 14 February 1828-Lazaryev reminded Paskevich,in a report prepared right there,that Armenians had done everything possible to ensure a Russian victory in the war and now wished to abandon their houses and move to the Russian side (i.e.from Iran to North Azerbaijan – editor).Lazaryev suggested the following to arrange a quick and smooth relocation of 381 AZERBAIJAN NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES,A.A.BAKIKHANOV INSTITUTE OF HISTORY T H E I R A В А Н K H A N A T E THE RUSSIAN OCCUPATION AND THE RELOCATION OF ARMENIANS TO THE LANDS OF NORTH AZERBAIJAN Armenians:“1)Paskevich should give him a written instruction to lead the relocation arrangements,pointing out the concessions granted to relocating persons; 2)Paskevich should assign to him the appointment of sufficient Armenian-speaking staff and officers to lead the relocation process (thereby,Lazaryev wanted to involve Armenian officers in this plan – editor); 3)The Russian army should be present in places where climatic conditions could delay the relocation,and accompany the relocating people; 4)finances should be allocated from the treasury for those relocators who were poor” [32,document 553,p.588; 32,document 561,p.603-604; 109,26].On February 26,Paskevich sent a special instruction to Lazaryev and,on February 29,another instruction to the “Temporary Governance” of Iravan stipulating the fulfillment of these suggestions.The 19-article order from Paskevich to Lazaryev stated:“Those engaged in trade among the Christians being relocated will be placed in cities to continue to engage in trade; fertile plots of sufficient size will be allocated to peasants and they will be relieved of taxes for 6 years,and of plot-related taxes for 3 years; special booklets describing the intended concessions must be handed out to the families ready to move; those being relocated must be divided into groups according to their villages and each group must consist of 150-300 families; those being relocated must be directed towards Iravan and Nakhchivan provinces so as to increase the numbers of Christians in those areas as much as possible; one Armenian-speaking officer and 2-5 Kazaks must be allocated to accompany each group; reports on the number of families,climatic conditions in the area in which they will be living,their engagements,their herds and the approximate time of their arrival at the border,must be sent to the “Temporary Governancet” of Iravan as soon as the relocating groups set off.25 thousand silver roubles must be allocated to help the poor families,not exceeding 10 silver roubles for each family” [see:46,98-107; see:end of chapter,document 3].382 AZERBAIJAN NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES,A.A.BAKIKHANOV INSTITUTE OF HISTORY T H E I R A В А Н K H A N A T E THE RUSSIAN OCCUPATION AND THE RELOCATION OF ARMENIANS TO THE LANDS OF NORTH AZERBAIJAN The 16-article order issued by Paskevich to the “Temporary Governance” of Iravan stated:“The Committee must allocate plots in accordance with the number of relocating families and ensure their settlement in the intended areas.The Committee must try to locate the inhabitants of relocated villages compactly,and in similar neighbourhood relationships to those in their previous dwellings.Those who were living in mountainous regions must be relocated to mountainous places and those living on plains must be relocated to plains,in order to reduce disease and deaths to the minimum and to enable them to maintain their traditions and industrial skills.* Christians must not be relocated to villages inhabited by Muslims,and separate regions and mahals must be created for Christians.The Christians (Muslims)living in the vicinity of villages inhabited by Muslims (Christians)must be relocated to areas near their religious brothers.Relocated people must be placed on state-owned plots,not on private estates.An equal amount of loan must be given to relocated people for the first sowing of grain until the new harvest; the loan issued for reviving the economy must be given for four continuous years and repaid during the succeeding six years.Conditions conducive to health and the availability of drinking water must be taken into account when choosing areas for habitatation.A report in special form must be given on the relocation of every single family,including the amount of total expenditure incurred” [77,189-191; 109,27-28].It must be noted that,later,the instruction to uphold the principle of volunteer commitment to relocation stipulated in both orders was totally ignored.That is,Lazaryev and the Armenian representatives he sent to the regions broke the Turkmanchay Treaty and the orders issued to them and began relocating Armenians to North Azerbaijan not voluntarily,but by force.* While the Russian government showed such care for Armenians,the population relocated from mountainous and plain areas from 1948-1953,during the deportation of Azerbaijanis from their native lands in the Armenian SSR was settled in the Kur-Araz lowlands of the Azerbaijan SSR,with quite a hot climate and their lives were not preserved.This grave crime resulted in massive deaths among the relocated population.383 AZERBAIJAN NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES,A.A.BAKIKHANOV INSTITUTE OF HISTORY T H E I R A В А Н K H A N A T E THE RUSSIAN OCCUPATION AND THE RELOCATION OF

SCIENCES,A.A.BAKIKHANOV INSTITUTE OF HISTORY 384 Understanding Russia’s intention to create a buffer Armenian state,Abbas Mirza was unhappy with the mass relocation of Armenians along the new Iranian-Russian borders [65,60].Therefore,he tried to prevent the relocation of Armenians from Iran.In order to obstruct this process,his representatives visited the regions,promising to relieve Armenians of taxes for 6 years if they did not relocate [32,document 586,p.619-620].Abbas Mirza turned twice to Colonel Lazaryev on this issue,asking him to stop the forced relocation of Armenians and to fulfil the conditions of the Turkmanchay Treaty [see:46,66-67,76-78].The Armenian colonel’s hypocritical policy was clearly revealed in Abbas Mirza’s second letter to Lazaryev:“At present,Our Honour is staying in Salmas and the troops are also there.You are demanding money via Kazaks or savuls from the villages not wishing to relocate,while paying money to those willing to relocate” [46,77-78].The forced relocation of Armenians to North Azerbaijani lands also provoked serious protests from Armenians.Lazaryev wrote about this in his report to General Paskevich:despite my continuous efforts to bring the countless Nestorians( Aysors-editor)living in Iran and offering them more financial assistance,I have managed to relocate only about 100 families after great effort [46,115].In addition,the bishop of Salmas Monastery Israel,was causing problems over the forced relocation of Armenians that’s why,the Armenian Archbishop Nerses asked General Paskevich,in a letter dated 17 March,1828,to issue an order to the local commandant in Khoy to make Israel stop these actions,deprive him of his title and send him to Üchkilsa for punishment [32,document 568,p.607-608; 65,72-73; 109,28].On March 19 of the same year,General Paskevich promised to fulfil this request in his letter of reply to Nerses [32,document 568,p.607-608].Implementation of the relocation.25 thousand silver roubles were allocated from the treasure to help the poor Armenian families relocating to North Azerbaijan.The task of Lazaryev and the Armenian officers assigned to him ended with the delivery of relocating people to the border.After that,the Committee established under the “Temporary Governance” of Iravan specifically for the settlement of relocated Armenians,was assigned to lead further arrangements.The Committee was supposed to send a delegation to meet the relocating groups of Armenians at the border and accompany them to the new settlements.In Garabagh this task was assigned to Duke Abkhazov,head of the customs military unit [46,105-106].Information about the implementation of Armenian relocation from Iran to North Azerbaijani territories can be traced in Lazaryev’s “Final Report” to Duke Paskevich on 24 December 1829.According to the report,the relocation process began on February 26 and finished on June 11.The Armenian General Gazaros Lazaryan,doing his utmost for the speedy implementation of this policy,personally led the process.The other Armenian officers helped him directly in the relocation of Armenians – Lieutenant-Colonel of the 41st Yeger regiment,Duke Melikov,in the relocation of Üzümchu and surrounding villages; Lieutenant-Colonel of the Georgian Grenadiers regiment,Duke Argutinsky-Dolgoruki,in the relocation of Tabriz,villages in its vicinity and the Salmas province; college assessor Gamazov,in the relocation of villages in the Maragha and Urmiya Khanates; and Duke Shalikov,in the relocation* of Armenians living in the Khoy Khanate [see:46,48,55,63,69,115-116].According to the agreement,the withdrawal of Russian troops began on March 8 from Maragha and,therefore,it was intended to relocate the Armenians living there first.Lazaryev,arriving in Maragha at the end of *Corresponding member of the Azerbaijan National Academy of Sciences,Doctor of Historical Sciences F.Mammadova,who is not a specialist in the period researched,writes that the Armenians relocated from Iran to Azerbaijan were ostensibly Christian Albans,exiled at the beginning of the XVII century from Garabagh to Iran [МаmеDоvа f.Дc.Каvкаzскаə Аlbаniə i аlbаnı.Бакu,2005,с.601-602 etc.].This view has no scientific basis,because research by I.Petrushevski,the renowned expert of the period and famous researcher in Oriental Studies,informs us that the Christians of Garabagh-the Albans having rebelled against Shah Abbjas I-were exiled to Mazandaran.The tsarist Russia never relocated any Christian population from Mazandaran to the North Azerbaijani territories.Further,if this non-scientific claim had even some scientific basis,the Russian invaders implementing the policy of relocation would have substantiated it before anybody else and better than anybody else.THE RUSSIAN OCCUPATION AND THE RELOCATION OF ARMENIANS TO THE LANDS OF NORTH AZERBAIJAN T H E I R A В А Н K H A N A T E AZERBAIJAN NATIONAL ACADEMY OF

Voynikov… and left Maragha on March 7.On March 9,General Paskevich and members of the “Temporary Governancel Board of Azerbaijan” left Tabriz.Abbas Mirza returned to power in Tabriz.Therefore,Lazaryev hurried past Tabriz and went to Sufiyan (a settlement in the north of Tabriz-editor)– to the Russian warlord and received permission for the allocation of new resources for the relocation [46,55-56].In his report to Paskevich on March 9 of the same year,Lazaryev stated that 4500 Armenian families had already been relocated to the Iranian bank of the River Araz [32,document 592,p.624-625].Having seen off the Armenians from different villages near Turkmanchay to territories of the former Garabagh Khanate,Lazaryev left Lieutenant-Colonel Argutinsky-Dolgoruki in Tabriz and set off for Maragha to continue the process of Armenian relocation [46,48].Families arriving from the Salmas and Gazvin Khanates also joined the groups relocated from Maragha [see:46,57-58].Noticing a delay in the relocation process,Lazaryev turned to Armenians on 30 March 1828.In his appeal,he said:“…there (i.e.in North Azerbaijan – editor)you will attain a New Motherland inhabited by Christians… You will see a coming together of Christians scattered through the various provinces of Iran.Hurry up! Time is precious.Soon the Russian troops will leave Iran,after which your relocation will be difficult and we will not be responsible for your safe relocation.Despite some minor losses,you will gain everything within a short period of time and forever” [46,107-111; see:end of chapter,document 4].The Armenian text of Lazaryev’s appeal was distributed among all the Armenians living in Iran.THE RUSSIAN OCCUPATION AND THE RELOCATION OF ARMENIANS TO THE LANDS OF NORTH AZERBAIJAN T H E I R A В А Н K H A N A T E AZERBAIJAN NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES,A.A.BAKIKHANOV INSTITUTE OF HISTORY 387 In April-May 1828,Lazaryev also ensured the relocation of Armenians living in Urmiya,Khoy,again the Salmas Khanate,as well as the Kurdistan area of Iran [see:46,59-60,61-62].Lazaryev tried to relocate not only Armenians,but also Kurds,to North Azerbaijani lands from Iran.In a report sent on 27 May 1828,Lazaryev stated his intention to relocate 500 families of Muslim Kurds from Iranian Kurdistan to the Iravan province.However,the Armenian officer’s plan was not carried out because,in a special letter sent on 29 February,Lazaryev himself had forbidden the relocation of Muslims [32,document 598,p.629; 109,29].Different archive documents also confirm the mass relocation of Armenians to North Azerbaijani lands.For example,a report dated 26 May 1828,presented to the Chief of Headquarters in Georgia,stated:“The relocation of Christians to the provinces belonging to Russia is being successfully implemented.279 families have already been settled in Garabagh and 948 families in the Iravan province; Colonel Lazaryev promises that the number of people relocated should reach 5 thousand families” [79,case 978,p.19].According to I.Shopen’s records,only 366 families (1715 persons)of the Armenians relocated from Iran were settled in Iravan city itself,265 families (1110 persons)in Nakhchivan city and 36 families (182 persons)in Ordubad city [95,636-638].The relocated Armenians were settled in 119 villages of Iravan province,61 villages of Nakhchivan province and 11 villages of Ordubad province.In total,4559 Armenian families (23568 persons)were placed in Iravan province,2137 families (10652 persons)in Nakhchivan province and 250 families (1340 persons)in Ordubad region.As a result,6949 Armenian families,consisting of 35560 persons,were relocated to the so-called “Armenian province” [95,635-642; 109,31-32].Lazaryev’s own report indicates that,over three and a half months,8249 Christian-Armenian families were relocated to the Iravan,Nakhchivan and Garabagh provinces,which meant at least 40 thousand people; 14,000 manats of gold and 400 manats of silver were spent on relocation arrangements; 1,500 Armenian families willing to relocate stayed in Iran.This was because Lazaryev did not have an opportunity to relocate them,as the time allocated for the relocation process had ended [see:46,131; 109,31].However,it should be taken into account that the number of Armenian families relocated to North Azerbaijani lands was not reflected completely accurately in Lazaryev’s report.For example,a Russian researcher N.A.Smirnov writes about the relocation of 90 thousand Armenians and their settlement on Azerbaijani territories [see:183,180].Settlement of relocated people.Gamazov,having fulfilled Lazaryev’s order,reported that the majority of Armenians relocated to the Iravan province were settled in the best mahals of the province – Sharur,Davachi,Garnichay,Zangi,Abaran,Qirkhbulag,Darachichak and Saat Chukhuru (Chukhursad – editor),i.e.the Sürmali mahal located on the Iranian side of the Araz River.More than 300 Armenian families,engaged in different crafts,were relocated to the houses of the local city population – that is,Azerbaijanis [153,135-136; 122,94].Around 200 Armenian families relocated from the Salmas and Khoy Khanates were sent to the Sürmali mahal on I.Argutinsky’s instruction [153,141; 122,94].Thus the Armenians relocated from Iran were settled in the cities of Iravan,Nakhchivan and Ordubad (in Nakhchivan – in the cities of Daralayaz,Sharur,Nakhchivan and Azadjiran; in central mahals of Iravan – Garnibassar,Zangibassar,Darachichak,Garbibassar,Abaran and others)[45,93; see:182,118].Despite Paskevich’s instruction concerning the settlement of relocated people in state-owned territories,the majority of Armenians were placed on estates belonging to Azerbaijani landowners.388 AZERBAIJAN NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES,A.A.BAKIKHANOV INSTITUTE OF HISTORY T H E I R A В А Н K H A N A T E THE RUSSIAN OCCUPATION AND THE RELOCATION OF ARMENIANS TO THE LANDS OF NORTH AZERBAIJAN The houses of Azerbaijanis,who were at the time in summer pastures,were distributed among the Armenians.The Azerbaijanis returning from summer pastures were left without homes.A Russian author of Armenian origin,I.K.Yenikolopov confirms this fact in his book:“After the Turkmanchay Treaty was signed,the relocation of individual groups took an ugly form:the majority of the new population (i.e.Armenians – editor)were placed in the homes of the peasants (i.e.Azerbaijani Turks-editor),most of whom were in summer pastures” [153,135].Furthermore,the “Notes Regarding the Relocation of Armenians from Iran to Our Provinces”,supposed to have been written by A.Griboyedov,mention that “in addition to the settlement of Armenians on landowner plots and the narrowing down of the Muslims’ estates,they were even given concessions,while Muslims were actually disadvantaged.In fact,we should consider not the Armenians,but the Muslims of these lands as the displaced persons.During the Armenian relocation,most of the Muslim families were in summer pastures and were unaware of the settlement of arriving Armenians in their homes”* [32,document 618,p.642-644; 65,81-85; 153,140; see:end of chapter,document 5].Original sources mention that most Armenians relocated from Iran were placed in Muslim villages,contrary to instructions.The new arrivals were placed in villages which were formerly inhabited by mixed Armenian and Muslim inhabitants.Naturally,the Azerbaijani population protested strongly against this situation,they had been deprived of their lands and homes.Such protest actions were raised most often in Nakhchivan villages.Therefore,Griboyedov suggested the movement of 500 Armenian families who had been relocated to villages inhabited by * Unlike the Russian sources [32,document 618,p.642-644; 65,81-85],I.Yenikolopov’s book men-tions that these records revealing the policy of the Russian government were authored by a soldier,D.Zubarev,not I.Griboyedov [see:153,140].389 AZERBAIJAN NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES,A.A.BAKIKHANOV INSTITUTE OF HISTORY T H E I R A В А Н K

to rough estimates,the Armenian relocation caused a loss of 32 million Russian rouble to Iran,mainly to South Azerbaijan.The local muslim population carried the burden of the relocation process on their shoulders,aggravating their condition severely.The relocation also resulted in Azerbaijanis abandoning fertile lands in North Azerbaijan.[see:130,94].Thus,the policy of the Russian Empire in relocating the Armenians to western areas of North Azerbaijan and Garabagh was designed to force Azerbaijanis to abandon their native lands and to prepare for the establishment of an “Armenian state”.The later course of historic events once again proves that Iranian Armenians were relocated to North Azerbaijan for a special purpose – to create “a new motherland” for them there.The military personnel and religious figures who participated actively in the relocation of Armenians from Iran to North Azerbaijan were rewarded by Russia.Relocation of Armenians from the Ottoman Empire to territories of the Iravan Khanate Encouraged by victory in the 1826-1828 Russian-Iranian War,the Russian army set off from Gümrü on 14 June 1828,under the command of Paskevich,crossed the River Arpachay with a troop of 12 thousand and launched attacks in Eastern Anatolia,conquering the Kars Fortress on June 23.The Russian troops extended their invasion and occupied Akhalkalak on July 24,Ahiska on August 15,Ardahan on August 22 and Bayazid in August 28.The war raged across a broad front again in the spring of 1829,the Russian army conquered Erzurum and later Mush,Oltun and Bayburt [109,33].THE RUSSIAN OCCUPATION AND THE RELOCATION OF ARMENIANS TO THE LANDS OF NORTH AZERBAIJAN T H E I R A В А Н K H A N A T E AZERBAIJAN NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES,A.A.BAKIKHANOV INSTITUTE OF HISTORY 391 By the way,the Azerbaijanis displaced from the Iravan Khanate’s territories-their native ancestral lands-due to the First and Second Russian-Iranian wars,had found shelter mostly in Eastern Anatolia.Most of the people suffering massacres and forced to abandon these places during the Russian attack on Eastern Anatolia were again Azerbaijanis.This time they were forced to move into the central areas of Turkey [193,826; 109,33].In August 1829,when the Russian army was approaching Istanbul from the Balkan frontier,Sultan Mahmud II offered peace to Russia and the Treaty of Adirna was signed on September 2.In accordance with the newly-established Russian-Turkish borders,the Akhalkalak Fortress and Akhiska city were annexed to Russia,while the occupied Kars,Trabzon,Bayazid and Erzurum pashates were returned to Turkey [109,34].Preparations for relocation.According to Article 13 of the Treaty of Adirna,the Armenians in the occupied territories of Turkey were entitled to pass into Russian administration,together with their movable property,within 18 months.The retreat of Russian troops from Kars,Ardahan,Bayazid,Erzurum and other districts put the Armenians who had betrayed the Turks during military operations in a difficult position.The Commandant’s Office of the Russian troops decided to relocate Turkish Armenians to the newly occupied Azerbaijani lands,just like the Iranian Armenians,thus ensuring that Armenians were the majority nation in the areas bordering on Turkey.With this in mind,General Paskevich wrote a report to Emperor Nicolas I on 10 October 1829,asking for permission to relocate 10 thousand Armenians living in Erzurum and Kars to Georgia and the “Armenian province” [32,docu-ment 818;109,34-35].On 18 November 1829,Military Minister Chernishev informed Paskevich of the Emperor’s approval of his suggestion [32,document THE RUSSIAN OCCUPATION AND THE RELOCATION OF ARMENIANS TO THE LANDS OF NORTH AZERBAIJAN T H E I R A В А Н K H A N A T E AZERBAIJAN NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES,A.A.BAKIKHANOV INSTITUTE OF HISTORY 392 819,p.830-832].Hearing this,Paskevich immediately began preparations.On December 3,he sent a letter to the Civil Governor of Georgia and informed him that he had granted permission to the commanders of local troops to issue the necessary documents to Armenians living in Turkey who were willing to move voluntarily to Georgia and other Russian-owned provinces and who were not demanding financial aid to do so.Also,that many Armenian families,using this opportunity,had already set off [32,document 820,p.831].Paskevich created a special Committee to lead the arrangements for the relocation and settlement of Armenian families.General Rules consisting of 12 articles were developed to regulate the Committee’s activity [32,document 822,p.835-836;109,35-36].Implementation of the relocation and settlement of relocated people.The Armenians relocated from Kars and its vicinity were settled in the emptied Azerbaijani villages around Alayaz (Alagöz)Mountain,which was similar to the climate of their previous habitats.General Pankratyev informed Paskevich that 95 Armenian families had been provided with documents to settle in the Loru Valley.Major-General Bereman also reported that he had provided 400 Armenian families relocated from Kars to Gümrü with documents [32,document 820,p.831].The Armenians relocated to the Iravan Khanate,Ganjabassar,Garabagh and other Azerbaijani territories,as well as to Georgia,were placed compactly on the lands of the local Muslim population – in areas and cities on mountain slopes distinguished by their natural beauty,fine climate and pure water.Even 270 houses in the Sardarabad Fortress were occupied by Armenians at that time [71,IV,291; 122,95].After some time,M.Vladikin wrote about the Armenian relocation to these areas:“The majority of Armenians living in the Iravan Qubernia are not the native THE RUSSIAN OCCUPATION AND THE RELOCATION OF ARMENIANS TO THE LANDS OF NORTH AZERBAIJAN T H E I R A В А Н K H A N A T E AZERBAIJAN NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES,A.A.BAKIKHANOV INSTITUTE OF HISTORY 393 population of these places; they were moved here from Turkey after the war of 1828-1829” [142,12; 122,95].According to information sent by Paskevich to Chernishev on 22 January 1830,2,500 Armenian families,having relocated from Kars and its surroundings,had been settled in emptied Azerbaijani villages near Alayaz (Alagöz)Mountain – in the Pambak district-which was similar to the climate of their previous environment,in accordance with his order [32,document 821,p.833; 109,37].The Turkish government,like the Iranian government,was concerned about the relocation of Armenians,who had been living scattered about her territories,and their compact settlement in the border area.Therefore,in order to prevent this relocation,the Ottoman government issued a resolution forgiving the Armenians for their betrayals of Turkey and the vandalism they had committed during the Russian invasions and,on February 17,sent “letters of forgiveness” to Armenians in the regions.To prevent the Armenian relocation,the Turkish side also sent its representatives to the occupied regions of Erzurum,Kars,Bayazid,Alashqird and others,which had been emptied by Russia in accordance with the Treaty of Adirna [189,186-187; 109,37-38].Paskevich sent his representative,Major Vannikov,to Erzurum to resolve the selling of the property and plots of relocating Armenians.By the way,the majority of Armenian villages in these areas had not belonged to them previously.These were villages abandoned by Muslims forced to move to safe places some time before,during the war.Armenians had thus gained control of the entire territory of 80 villages and half of 15 villages in the Kars region alone.On the other hand,Russia was not interested at all in the destiny of the property and lands abandoned by the Turks who had escaped from Russian-occupied territories (mainly the Akhalkalak and Akhiska regions)and other Turkish regions,as well as the villages they had been obliged to abandon [109,38].The approximate number of Armenian families relocated from Turkey and their areas of habitat is mentioned in a document prepared on the eve of the deadline established by the Treaty of Adirna,i.e.before 3 April 1831.The Armenians relocated from Turkey were settled in Akhiska,Pambak-Shöreyel and the “Armenian province” [32,document 830,p.847].The document reveals that 14,044 Armenian families were relocated from the Turkish pashates to the Russian borders (i.e.the Akhiska Pashate,Borchaly distance (region-trans.)Pambak and Shöreyel,Talin mahal,vicinity of Lake Göycha and Bash Abaran).5,000 of 7,218 Armenian families relocated from Erzurum,as well as 67 Armenians from Ardahan,were settled in the Akhiska Pashate*,1,050 families in the Borchaly distance and around Zalga,and the remaining 1,305 families – in the Pambak and Shöreyel distances.2264 out of 2464 families relocated from Kars were settled in the Pambak and Shöreyel distances and 200 in the Talin district; and the 4215 families relocated from Bayazid – around Lake Göycha and in Bash Abaran [32,document 830,p.847].A note to the document indicates that the number of people relocated from Turkey is not shown precisely,due to the absence of a full and accurate report.However,according to the estimates of the Committee,over 84 thousand Armenians and Greeks were relocated from the Ottoman State [32,document 830,p.847;109,39].Nevertheless,in His Excellency’s order issued to Duke Paskevich on 24 April 1831 it is mentioned that 380 thousand silver roubles were * The Akhiska Pashate is the Javakheti region of present-day Georgia.After the Stalin regime forcibly relocated the region’s native population – Mehseti Turks to Central Asia in the mid XX century,Armenians were settled there again,for the second time.Maintaining their false territorial claims against their neighbours,today Armenians still lay territorial claims to the Javakheti (Mehseti)region.394 AZERBAIJAN NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES,A.A.BAKIKHANOV INSTITUTE OF

of over 14 thousand families (around 90 thousand persons)[89,61; 32,document 821,p.847].General Paskevich reported the number of people relocated to be over 90 thousand [32,document 829,p.845; 172,66],while an Armenian historian,Tavakalyan,sets their number at near-ly 100 thousand persons [186,37].The Armenians relocated from the Ottoman Empire to Georgia were settled mainly in the regions inhabited by the Akhiska Turks of Azerbaijan.This fact is also confirmed by Georgian authors.After the Treaty of Adirna,more than 106 thousand Armenians turned to General Paskevich with a request to be settled in the Akhiska region.The first big flow of relocation was to Akhiska and the second – to Kvemo-Kartli (Borchali-editor)[212,75].General Paskevich settled 100 thousand Armenians relocated from Erzurum in the Akhalkalak and Akhiska regions [212,100].By 1832,the majority of the Akhiska population was Armenian [213,82-111].According to another writer,20 thousand Armenian families relocated by Russia were placed in Javakheti (Akhiska – editor)[211,70].In general,since the Armenians relocated from Turkey to the former Iravan Khanate did not wish to live in cities,they chose the southern and western areas of Göycha,the Darachichak,Abaran,Sürmali and Talin mahals to live [45,93; see:182,118}.Thus,the majority of newly relocated people were settled in northern and central parts of the Iravan province and on almost the entire territory of Pambak-Shöreyel.[71,II,303-304; 182,118].The military and religious figures who participated actively in the Armenian relocation from Turkey were highly rewarded,just like those in the previous Armenian relocation from Iran.395 AZERBAIJAN NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES,A.A.BAKIKHANOV INSTITUTE OF HISTORY T H E I R A В А Н K H A N A T

A N A T E AZERBAIJAN NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES,A.A.BAKIKHANOV INSTITUTE OF HISTORY 396 According to I.Shopen’s census,after the 1828-1829 Russian-Turkish War,in total,21,666 Armenians (3,682 families)and 324 Yezidi Kurds (67 families)were relocated from Turkey to the “Armenian province”.The relocated Armenians were settled mainly in 129 villages of the Qirkhbulag,Sürmali,Talin,Körpübassar,Abaran,Darachichak and Göycha mahals of the former Iravan Khanate [95,636-642; 109,40].It must be noted that since the Shöreyel and Lori-Pambak regions belonging to North Azerbaijan were annexed to Georgia from1801-1805,they were not added to the “Armenian province” and remained within Georgia.Until 1829 (i.e.the official relocation of Armenians after the Russian-Turkish War)1,536 Armenian families (5,425 males)were relocated to the Shöreyel-Pambak distance.Later,3,148 families (10,575 males)were relocated from Turkey.At the end of 1832 and the beginning of 1833,182 families (674 males)of the Armenians relocated from Turkey to Zalgaya were moved again to the Shöreyel-Pambak distance.Among those relocated,there were also 169 Greek and 963 Armenian Catholics [71,p.II,302-304; 109,41].According to Smirnov,Armenians used their entitlement under the Turkmanchay and Adirna Treaties,and 90 thousand Armenians from Iran and approximately 75 thousand Armenians from Turkey moved to Azerbaijani territories [183,180].The American historian of Armenian origin,G.Bournoutian,admitted the relocation of many Armenians to the Iravan Khanate following the Russian invasions and the Armenianization of native Azerbaijani toponyms; for example,he mentions that the centre of the Göycha Mahal Kavar was renamed and called Nor Bayazid after the relocation of Armenians [200,37-38; 145,122].THE RUSSIAN OCCUPATION AND THE RELOCATION OF ARMENIANS TO THE LANDS OF NORTH AZERBAIJAN T H E I R A В А Н K H A N A T E AZERBAIJAN NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES,A.A.BAKIKHANOV INSTITUTE OF HISTORY 397 The change in the ethnic-demographic make-up of the Iravan Khanate to the benefit of Armenians Due to the relocation policy,implemented by the Russian Empire,the ethnic-demographic make-up of the Iravan Khanate was changed to the benefit of Armenians.As mentioned,the “Armenian province”,created from Azerbaijani lands on 21 March 1828,was divided into the Iravan and Nakhchivan provinces and the Ordubad region.During the establishment of the “Armenian province” by decree of the Emperor,4 regions were created in the Iravan province:Iravan,Sardarabad,Sharur and Sürmali.The mahals included in those regions remained as before [71,IV.270].The Armenian relocation from Iran and Turkey to the Iravan Khanate continued for a long time after the occupation.Referring to documents kept in Matenadaran,N.A.Tavakalyan notes that the number of Armenians relocated from Iran was 8,510 families [186,33].According to the census of 1834,1,807 of the 2,750 families living around the city of Iravan were Tatars (i.e.Azerbaijani Turks – editor),898 were Armenian families and 40 were Bosha families (Gypsies – editor)among them,many were masters and craftsmen of various specialties [71,IV,291].According to that census,the Iravan province had total 22,336 families,of which 65,300 were males.29,690 of them were Tatars (i.e.Azerbaijani Turks – editor),10,350 – previously relocat-ed Armenians,24,255 – Armenians relocated from Iran and Turkey,around 1,000 – Yezidi Kurds relocated from the Bayazid pashate and a small number of Gypsies called Bosha [71,IV,270-271; see:end of chapter,table 5].Beginning of the displacement of the Azerbaijani population from their native lands The persecution and oppression of the Azerbaijani population,due to the Armenian relocation,resulted in a continuous migration of Muslims from Iravan and Nakhchivan in 1828,either openly or secretly leaving their motherland to find refuge in foreign countries [32,document 622,p.646; document 623,p.647].Such a situation completely satisfied the Russian invaders and relocated Armenians.That is,under Paskevich’s order issued in April 1828,displaced Muslims leaving the Iravan province could only return to the Russian borders (i.e.the territories of their former motherland the Iravan Khanate – editor)with his special permission [32,document 438,p.490].At the beginning of 1829,college assessor I.Shopen conducted an in-house census in the “Armenian province”,to Paskevich-Erivanski’s instruction.The results of the census,comprising 20 volumes of manuscripts,were reflected in the author’s “Historical Monument of the Annexation of the Armenian Province to the Russian Empire”,published in 1852.According to I.Shopen’s census,521 of the 752 villages existing in the “Armenian province” after the wars were a part of the Iravan province,179 – of the Nakhchivan province and 52 – of the Ordubad region [95,485-503].The wars had left in ruins 359 villages in the province,310 villages in the Iravan province (it should be noted that the Sharur Mahal was then a part of the Iravan province – editor),43 villages in the Nakhchivan province and 6 villages in the Ordubad region.The population of these Azerbaijani villages were massacred or displaced from their native lands [95,510-518:See:end of chapter,appendix 3].So,there were in total 1111 villages (359 ruined and 752 standing)in the 398 AZERBAIJAN NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES,A.A.BAKIKHANOV INSTITUTE OF HISTORY T H E I R A В А Н K H A N A T E THE RUSSIAN OCCUPATION AND THE RELOCATION OF ARMENIANS TO THE LANDS OF NORTH AZERBAIJAN “Armenian province”,together with the ruined and razed villages,out of which 831 (521 standing and 310 ruined villages)had previously been a part of the Iravan Khanate [109,23; See:appendix 2,3].According to I.Shopen’s estimates,approximately 23,730 families (17,000 families in the Iravan province,4,600 in the Nakhchivan province and 2,130 in the Ordubad region)were living on those territories constituting the “Armenian province” before the Iravan and Nakhchivan khanates were occupied by Russia,which makes 118,650 persons,if we allow an average of 5 persons in every family [95,542].According to the census,up to the relocation 81,749 Muslims and 25,151 Armenians* were recorded in the province.This historical fact demonstrates that,despite the mass relocation of Armenians,the local Azerbaijani population still formed the overwhelming majority.Furthermore,I.Shopen’s census also shows the number of Armenian families (in total 10,631 families)relocated to Azerbaijani lands from Iran (35,560 persons)and Turkey (21,666 persons)per individual settlement.This leads to the conclusion that the census was the first source to reflect the then historical reality [see:end of chapter,appendix 2].The Armenian relocation to Azerbaijani territories continued in the following years.The artificial increase in the number of Armenians by relocation and the decrease of local Azerbaijani Turks on the ancient Azerbaijani land of the Iravan Khanate,following the Russian invasions,is quite clear.That is,while the number of Armenians in the Iravan Khanate before the 1826-1828 Russian invasions was fewer than 20%**,the same number was brought up to 55.5% after the invasions – in 1832.* According to I.Shopen’s census,“local Armenians” registered in the “Armenian province” were relocated to these territories during the Russian-Iranian and Russian-Turkish wars of the early XIX century.** As mentioned,the majority of the Armenians constituting almost 20% of the Iravan Khanate’s population were relocated here mostly at the beginning of the XIX century,when the Russian invasions commenced.399 AZERBAIJAN NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES,A.A.BAKIKHANOV INSTITUTE OF HISTORY T H E I R A В А Н K H A N A T E THE RUSSIAN OCCUPATION AND THE RELOCATION OF ARMENIANS TO

SCIENCES,A.A.BAKIKHANOV INSTITUTE OF HISTORY 400 The compulsory modifications to the population’s demographic composition are also confirmed by Russian sources:“The population of Pambak and Shöreyel changed after the Russian conquest.The resident population (i.e.Azerbaijani Turks – editor)was replaced by new-comers (i.e.Armenians-editor).That is,one can hardly find an old Armenian among the local population,who was living in those places previously.The new population has been relocated here mainly from the “Armenian province”,Erzurum,Kars and Kurdistan.At present,inhabitants of the Pambak distance are divided into 2 parts:the local population (i.e.Azerbaijani Turks – editor)and those newly-relocated (i.e.Armenians – editor).The latter are those who became subjects of the Russian government after the Russian-Turkish wars,in 1829”.According to the in-house census of 1829,the distance’s population consisted of local inhabitants – 1536 families (5425 persons)and the newly relocated-3148 families (10575 males)[71,II,303; 122,95-96].The population of Iravan and Nakhchivan villages underwent the greatest ethnic modifications.The number of Armenians in both provinces more than doubled.In Iravan,Armenians equalled the local population in numbers and in Nakhchivan they comprised 1/3rd of the total population.Of the urban population,Azerbaijanis were still the majority:64% in Iravan city,over 66% in Nakhchivan and 98% in Ordubad [95,636-638; 182,118].It must be noted that Armenians had to leave the Nakhchivan area due to mass protests by the local population.N.Voronov mentioned that,in general,during the settlement of relocated people,the Russian government tried to reduce the significance of the Muslim element via Armenian relocations to these territories [45,92].According to the census of 1832,Muslims (Azerbaijani Turks – editor)were living in 463 villages in the Iravan province,Armenians in 98 and Azerbaijanis and Armenians were living in 65 villages together.THE RUSSIAN OCCUPATION AND THE RELOCATION OF ARMENIANS TO THE LANDS OF NORTH AZERBAIJAN T H E I R A В А Н K H A N A T E AZERBAIJAN NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES,A.A.BAKIKHANOV INSTITUTE OF HISTORY 401 The mass settlement of Armenians in the Göycha,Abaran,Vedibassar,Sharur and other mahals,previously never inhabited by Armenians,draws attention.The Armenians relocated from Iran were settled in 62 villages forcibly abandoned by Azerbaijani Turks,68 villages inhabited by Azerbaijani Turks,24 villages with a mixed population and only 32 newly-built Armenian villages.Unlike the Armenians relocated from Iran,those relocated from Turkey were settled in 64 villages,which were inhabited exclusively by Muslims before the Russian invasions and forcibly abandoned afterwards.Some of them were settled in villages where Armenians had already been relocated (15 villages),of Iranian Armenians (23 villages)and those inhabited by mixed populations (12 villages).An insignificant number of Turkish Armenians were settled in Azerbaijani-Armenian villages (12 villages).So,the displaced Armenians were settled in 126 emptied Azerbaijani villages,70 villages inhabited by Azerbaijanis,22 mixed villages and 47 Armenian villages [95,543-630; see:182,118-119].Even Griboyedov,who authored the project of Armenian relocation to North Azerbaijani territories,gave a negative assessment of the relocation process and mentioned that Armenians were settled,not on state-owned territories,but mainly on lands belonging to Muslims-landowners and peasants,which resulted in the oppression of the Muslims [32,document 618,p.642].A major part of the Armenians relocated to North and West Azerbaijani territories (present territory of Armenia-editor)were settled on the lands of Azerbaijanis,who were peasants of the state.As the owners of these lands were in summer pastures during summer,the operation to settle the incoming Armenians passed off quietly at first and no conflict occurred.However,later,the local population returned from summer pastures,and this marked the beginning of serious discontent among Muslims observing the permanent nature of the relocation process.The Russian diplomat Griboyedov wrote on this issue:“We have THE RUSSIAN OCCUPATION AND THE RELOCATION OF ARMENIANS TO THE LANDS OF NORTH AZERBAIJAN T H E I R A В А Н K H A N A T E AZERBAIJAN NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES,A.A.BAKIKHANOV INSTITUTE OF HISTORY 402 discussed over and over again the question of eliminating the fears of the Muslims,who think Armenians will get a permanent hold on these lands,to which they were allowed for the first time,and calming them down by informing them this grave situation will not continue for a long time” [47,341].Interestingly,following the Russian ambassador’s suggestion,the Muslims were provided with false information about the Armenian settlement on their lands.Griboyedov wrote that now we have to reconcile the Muslims with the grave situation they are in and persuade them of the temporary nature of the Armenians’ stay on these lands.Because Azerbaijanis have developed the idea that “Armenians get a permanent hold on any land they first step on”.We should divert the Muslims from this idea” [47,341].By instruction of the Relocation Committee,the newly-built Christian-Armenian villages were supposed to be separate from Muslim-Azerbaijani villages and Christian-Armenians were supposed to be settled in special regions and mahals [90,159].The mass relocation of Armenians to the Iravan Khanate’s territories continued in later periods.Along with Armenians,Yezidi Kurds were also placed in the Iravan Khanate.According to information from 1834,1,000 Yezidi Kurds (approximately 300 families)relocated from Bayazid,were settled in the Iravan province [71,p.IV,270-271].Yezidi Kurds were also settled in several emptied Azerbaijani villages on the slopes of Alayaz (Alagöz)mountain.Yezidi Kurds were settled in Shirak,Guruboghaz,Jarjarchi and Chobangarakmaz villages in 1839 and,later,in Pambak,Gundakhsaz,Böyük Jamishli,Kichik Jamishli and Korbulag villages.Finally,in 1877,Yezidi Kurds were settled in Baghdad-Dolu-Takht and Kichik Jangi (or Shah Sangar)villages.The Greeks relocated from Turkey were settled mainly in Bayandur,Sisimadan and Alakilsa (Baytar)villages of the Shöreyel-Pambak distance and in Gümrü [109,42;70,4]].THE RUSSIAN OCCUPATION AND THE RELOCATION OF ARMENIANS TO THE LANDS OF NORTH AZERBAIJAN T H E I R A В А Н K H A N A T E AZERBAIJAN NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES,A.A.BAKIKHANOV INSTITUTE OF HISTORY 403 In general,during the mass relocations following the 1826-1828 Russian-Iranian and 1828-1829 Russian-Turkish Wars,57,226 Armenians (10,631 families)were relocated to the “Armenian province” – territories of the Iravan and Nakhchivan Khanates-from Iran and Turkey.Before the relocations,there were only 25,151 Armenians (4,428 families)living in that area; they had been relocated to those territories during previous wars.Many Azerbaijani Turks became refugees from the Iravan and Nakhchivan Khanates,due to the wars,and only 81,749 Azerbaijanis (16,078 families)remained there.After the massive relocations,the number of Armenians in the “Armenian province” reached 82,377 (15,059 families).Consequently,the Armenian popula-tion exceeded the Muslim one,albeit insignificantly [95,642; 109,42].Thus,the Imperial Russian and Armenian politicians implementing this policy achieved their aims.In general,taking into account the settlement of 6,949 of the 8,249 families relocated from Iran in the “Armenian province”,we can conclude that the remaining 1,300 families were relocated to Garabagh and Zangazour [109,32].In 1840,the “Armenian province” was liquidated.The Iravan Uezd was created instead and added to the Georgian-Imerety Qubernia.This was another heavy strike against the territorial-statehood traditions of Azerbaijan,marking the next step on the path to the establishment of an Armenian state in the Iravan Khanate.In 1849,the Iravan Qubernia consisted of the Iravan,Alexandropol (Gümrü – editor),Nakhchivan,Ordubad and Novo-Bayazid (the eastern part of the Göycha mahal – editor)uezds and this system remained unchanged until 1917 [109,24].The establishment of the Iravan Qubernia was the decisive step in the creation of an Armenian state in North Azerbaijani territories.The number of Muslims in the newly-established “Armenian province” was 81,749 (16,078 families)and the relocated Armenians THE RUSSIAN OCCUPATION AND THE RELOCATION OF ARMENIANS TO THE LANDS OF NORTH AZERBAIJAN T H E I R A В А Н K H A N A T E AZERBAIJAN NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES,A.A.BAKIKHANOV INSTITUTE OF HISTORY 404 25,151 (4,428 families)before the invasions while,after the invasions and Armenian relocations from Iran,the latter number reached 82,377 (15,059 families)[95,639-642].Thus,the number of Armenians was increased from 24% to 43%.By the way,at the beginning of the XIX century,some ruling circles in the Russian Empire preferred the settlement,not of Armenians,but Russian colonists – Kazaks,Molokans,Dukhobors and Christians of other confessions on Azerbaijani territories.Although several projects were drafted with this purpose,their implementation was later postponed.N.N.Shavrov wrote about the Russian colonization policy in the South Caucasus:“We began our colonization activity not with the settlement of Russians in the South Caucasus,but of another nation,which was a stranger to us… During the two years after the end of the 1826-1828 war – from 1828 till 1830-we relocated 40 thousand Iranian and 84 thousand Turkish Armenians to the South Caucasus and settled them on the best state-owned lands of the Yelizavetpol and Iravan Qubernias,where the Armenian population was a minority.We also settled them in the Borchali,Akhiska and Akhalkalak uezds of the Tiflis Qubernia.Over 200 thousand desyatins of state-owned lands were allocated for their settlement and special property lands were purchased from Muslims,amounting to more than 2 million roubles.The Armenians were settled in the mountainous areas of the Yelizavetpol Qubernia and on the bank of Lake Göycha.It should be considered that,along with the officially relocated 124 thousand Armenians,there were also many unofficially relocated and,in general,the number of relocated people was much greater than 200 thousand” [92,63; 109,43].The Armenian influx to territories of the former Iravan Khanate speeded up even further after the Russian-Turkish War of 1877-1878.THE RUSSIAN OCCUPATION AND THE RELOCATION OF ARMENIANS TO THE LANDS OF NORTH AZERBAIJAN T H E I R A В А Н K H A N A T E AZERBAIJAN NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES,A.A.BAKIKHANOV INSTITUTE OF HISTORY 405 After Armenian revolts against the government in Turkey were subdued in the 1890s,400 thousand more Armenians moved to the South Caucasus – Azerbaijani territories.N.Shavrov noted that,at the beginning of the XIX century,over one million of the 1,300,000 Armenians living in the South Caucasus in the early XIX century are not the local population,we have brought them here.We present N.Shavrov’s records as they are:"Êðî ìå àð ìəí â íà şè ïðå äå ëı ïå ðå ñå ëè ëîñü íå êîòî ðîå êî-ëè çåñò âî àé ñîð,à òàê æå è ìó ñóëü

century,modified the region’s ethnic composition by force.Preparing for new wars against Iran and Turkey,Imperial Russia massively relocated Armenians from Iran and Turkey to the newly-occupied Northern Azerbaijani territories – the former Iravan,Nakhchivan and Garabagh Khanates-in order to create a new Christian-buffer zone in the South Caucasus.This marked the appearance of a new conglomeration – the Armenian conglomeration on the ethnic map of the South Caucasus since the 1820-30s.Rendering all kinds of services to Russia in the wars against Iran and the Ottoman State and striving to create a state for themselves from Azerbaijani,Georgian and Turkish territories,Armenians created a centre of permanent tension in the South Caucasus.The era of massacres and deportations

vandalism:obliteration of historical names 10 MODERN VANDALISM:OBLITERATION OF HISTORICAL NAMES Today,Armenian nationalists continue to distort the historical past of the South Caucasus before the eyes of the international community.Armenians from Iran and the Ottoman Empire,who were relocated to the occupied territory of the Iravan Khanate of the Azerbaijani state,under the terms of the treaties of Turkmanchay (1828)and Adirna (1829)and with the support of Russian colonialists,began to carry out genocide and deportations against the aboriginal Azerbaijani population.In order to save themselves from massacres ,these indigenous inhabitants migrated to East Azerbaijan,Iran ,the Ottoman Empire and other countries.In 1988,the deportation of Azerbaijanis from the territory of the former Iravan Khanate-the present Armenia-was completed.Modern Armenian vandals obliterated thousand-year-old Azerbaijani place-names and toponyms from the territory of the former Iravan Khanate.Azerbaijani place-names were armenianised.To cut a long story short,Armenians create a forged “history” for themselves.…It is evident to science that Armenians are not the native population of the South Caucasus.The historical truth is that they are not the local inhabitants,more exactly,they are a relocated ethnicity in the South Caucasus.This was confirmed long ago by research based on primary sources.The people considered to be the ancestors of Armenians appeared in the upper reaches of the Euphrates River in the middle of the 1st millenium.They had moved there from the Balkan Peninsula.The ancestors of the Azerbaijani people,having formed a high culture in a vast region,including the South Caucasus,long before the Armenians appeared in Asia.The Azerbaijanis had created the state of Manna in the south of the River Araz,and the mighty state of Albania to the north.500 AZERBAIJAN NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES,A.A.BAKIKHANOV INSTITUTE OF HISTORY THE RUSSIAN OCCUPATION AND THE RELOCATION OF ARMENIANS TO THE LANDS OF NORTH AZERBAIJAN T H E I R A В А Н K H A N A T E The Azerbaijani state of Albania covered all Azerbaijani lands north of the River Araz,including the territories between the rivers Araz and Kur and the territory of historical Garabagh.After the fall of the state of Albania,Azerbaijani lands north of the River Araz were within either Azerbaijani states or different Turkic-Muslim empires of the historical period.So,up to 1918 there was no Armenian state in the South Caucasus.This is a historical truth confirmed by primary sources.The background of the idea to found an Armenian state,which is now the main focus of tension in the South Caucasus,originated in the recent past,at the beginning of the 19th century during the wars of invasion by the Russian Empire against Iran and the Ottoman Empire.In that period,in seeking to build reliable support in the South Caucasus,Russia benefited from the Christian factor.And following this aim,Armenians were relocated en masse from Iran and the Ottoman Empire into the recently occupied lands of North Azerbaijan,mainly the territories of the former Azerbaijani states – the Khanates of Iravan,Nakhchivan and Garabagh.In order to raise the relocated Armenians against the native Turkic-Muslim population,on 21March 1828,on one of the Azerbaijani people’s national holidays Novruz days,an “Armenian Province” was created on the territories of the Azerbaijani Khanates of Iravan and Nakhchivan,by decree of the Russian Emperor Nicolas I.On the territory of the newly created “Armenian Province” there were 1111 villages; Armenians lived in only 62 of them and they were the relocated Armenians of 1828.Further,the names of only 14 from 62 villages were Armenian in origin.After the creation of the “Armenian Province”,a period of ethnic cleansing of the eternal Azerbaijani lands began,by the Armenians who had been relocated there by tsarist Russia.In order to deprive the people of Azerbaijan of their ancestral lands,deportations and massacres were carried out.As a result,a process of massive settlement of Armenians in 501 AZERBAIJAN NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES,A.A.BAKIKHANOV INSTITUTE OF HISTORY THE RUSSIAN OCCUPATION AND THE RELOCATION OF ARMENIANS TO THE LANDS OF NORTH AZERBAIJAN T H E I R A В А Н K H A N A T E Azerbaijani lands was completed.The Russian researcher N.Shavrov wrote in 1911:“At the present time in the South Caucasus,more than one million Armenians,from 1.3 million,are not native inhabitants of this region and we (Russians)have relocated them here.” On 29 May 1918,the People’s Republic of Azerbaijan conceded the city of Iravan,with the adjoining area,to Armenians,for the sake of peace and stability in the South Caucasus.So,for the first time in the history of the South Caucasus,an Armenian state was created at the expense of Azerbaijani lands.Since that time,with close support from Russia,the process of cleansing Azerbaijanis from the lands of West Azerbaijan has intensified and the lands where Armenians were accommodated have extended eastwards at the expense of the territories of Azerbaijan.In the period of Bolshevik Russia,this process intensified even further.In 1988,the process of deportation of Azerbaijanis from their ancestral lands of West Azerbaijan (the territory of the present Republic of Armenia)was completed.In the recent past,the overwhelming majority of the population in these lands – the present territory of the Republic of Armenia-consisted of Azerbaijanis; now no Azerbaijani remains there.The Armenian nationalists who carried out the deportations and massacres against Azerbaijanis in 1905-1906,1918-1920,1948-1953 and 1988,razed to the ground thousands of historical monuments,rare materials and spiritual values,mosques,minarets and graveyards and obliterated historical names.The result of this continuous vandalism by Armenian nationalists on the territory of the present Armenia (historical West Azerbaijan),against the spiritual values belonging to Azerbaijanis,tens of thousands of historical names have been changed and armenianised.Primary sources,including archive documents,confirm that the process of changing the names of settlements and other place names 502 AZERBAIJAN NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES,A.A.BAKIKHANOV INSTITUTE OF HISTORY THE RUSSIAN OCCUPATION AND THE RELOCATION OF ARMENIANS TO THE LANDS OF NORTH AZERBAIJAN T H E I R A В А Н K H A N A T E started in 1919 – immediately after the establishment (in 1918)of an Armenian state on the territory of Azerbaijan by decision of the government of the Republic of Armenia.Between the establishment of Soviet power and 1935,the names of more than 190 settlements had been changed.In the following period,the process of changing historical Azerbaijani names intensified and,in 1991,after the establishment of the Republic of Armenia,it was basically completed.The following tables are the result of intensive efforts by the famous researcher Nazim Mustafa,who has revealed the essence of modern Armenian vandalism against humanity.The main merit of this book is that the tables included are based primarily on Armenian sources.Let pro-Armenian western politicians,who pursue a policy of double standards and who support the Armenian nationalists,become closely acquainted with the forgery of history by Armenian vandals.Maybe then they will turn their faces towards truth,call a spade a spade concerning those who create a fabricated history for themselves and respect the historical UNESCO conventions of 1954,1970 and 1972 on the preservation of cultural values.Yagub Mahmudov Honoured Scientist,Corresponding Member of the Azerbaijan National Academy of Sciences Professor,Doctor of Historical Sciences 503 AZERBAIJAN NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES,A.A.BAKIKHANOV INSTITUTE OF HISTORY THE RUSSIAN OCCUPATION AND THE RELOCATION OF ARMENIANS TO THE LANDS OF NORTH AZERBAIJAN T H E I R A В А Н K H A N A T E Azerbaijani toponyms faced obliteration During the time of tsarist Russia,all the maps and statistical information on the Turkic-origin names of all settlements were preserved.In the Soviet period,“operations to change names” were conducted by official decrees of the Supreme Soviet of the Armenian SSR in 1935,1938,1939,1940,1946,1947,1948,1949,1950,1957,1962,1968,1969,1977,1978 and 1980.The Turkic-origin names of five hundred and twenty settlements had been changed by August 1988.The list of settlement name changes presented here are based on the book “The administrative-territorial division of the Armenian SSR” published in 1976 and 1988,as well as on the 9 April 1991 decree of the Supreme Soviet of the Armenian SSR and on a “Map of the Armenian Republic” published in Iravan in 2002.The name changing operation was conducted in the following way:1.First,they paid special attention to changing place names that were connected with the background and historical past of Azerbaijanis.For example,Ashaghi Türkmanli (original Azerbaijani name)– Lusaqyugh (changed into Armenian)-(this village is situated in the Echmiadzin region); Gorchulu-Mrgashad (Hoktemberyan region); Sardarabad – Hoktember ( Hoktemberyan region); Bayandur – Vaghadur (Gorus region); Shirvanjig – Lernakert (Artik region).2.The names of some settlements have been translated into Armenian,word for word.For example:Armudlu – Tandzut (Hoktemberyan),Dashgala-Karaberd (Ani),Darakand – Dzorgyugh (Gugark),Darachichak – Tsaxkadzor (Razdan),Girl – Lichk (Martuni),Güllübulag –Vardaxpyur (Gukasyan).3.The names of some settlements have been changed under the guise of “internationalism”.For example:Garaqishlag – Dostlug (Masis),Sultanabad – Shurabad (Amasiya),Jüjakand – Qizilshafag (Kalinino),Ashaghi Nejili – Sayat-Nova (Masis),Chanakhchi – Sovetakert (Ararat).This process was conducted simultaneously with the process of modernization.504 AZERBAIJAN NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES,A.A.BAKIKHANOV INSTITUTE OF HISTORY THE RUSSIAN OCCUPATION AND THE RELOCATION OF ARMENIANS TO THE LANDS OF NORTH AZERBAIJAN T H E I R A В А Н K H A N A T E 4.Some names of settlements were slightly changed,similar sound-ing but replaced by armenianised names.For example:Darabbas – Darbas (Sisian),Dalilar – Dalar (Artashat),Alayaz – Aragats (Talin),Aravus – Revis (Sisian),Gabud – Kapuyt (Azizbeyov),Chirpili – Jrapi (Ani).5.In the book “The administrative-territorial division of the Armenian SSR”,Turkic–origin names of settlements which used words like “yukhari-upper”,“ashaghi-lower”,“böyük-big”,“ kichik-small” were substituted by corresponding Armenian translations,like “verin-upper”,“ nerkin-lower”,“ mets-big”,“pokr-small” in the first part of the village name.In this way they tried to establish that they are words of Armenian origin.For example,Verin Zaghali – Akhpradzor (Vardenis),Nerkin Zeyva – Hartashen (Echmiadzin),Mets Kapanakchi – Musaelyan (Akhuryan),Pokr Sepasar (Gukasyan).In the tables we have not given the armenianised version,but the original Azerbaijani word.6.Until 1935 in Armenia,the Turkic-origin names of settlements were changed without a decree by the Supreme Soviet.For example:Babirli – Bartstrashen (Ani),Daymadaghli – Shrvenants (Gafan),Tovuzgala – Berd (Shamshaddil),Shirabad – Parakar (Echmiadzin).It should also be mentioned that each time the names of settlements were changed by decree of the Supreme Soviet,they liquidated the names of these settlements from the list of place names as well.For example,by the decree of the Supreme Soviet of the Armenian SSR dated 5 February 1978,the names of the villages of Ashaghi Kilsa (Gugark),Aghtala (Kamo)and Rahimabad (Masis),Gamishli (Vardenis)were liquidated from the list of settlements.In the years from 1917-1987,on the territory of the present Armenia,254 settlements were liquidated from the list in different ways and their inhabitants faced genocide and deportations.After the deportations of Azerbaijanis from 1948-1953,the names of more than 60 settlements were changed.In 1978 alone,60 Turkic-origin toponyms were changed in 23 regions.And on 9 April 1991,by decree of the Supreme Soviet of the Armenian SSR,the names of 90 Azerbaijani settlements were changed.In total,667 place names have been changed up to the recent period.505 AZERBAIJAN NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES,A.A.BAKIKHANOV INSTITUTE OF HISTORY THE RUSSIAN OCCUPATION AND THE RELOCATION OF

During the Russian Empire’s wars of invasion aimed at the occupation of the South Caucasus in the early XIX century,the Armenians living in the territories of Iran and Turkey actively assisted the Russian troops,thus acting against their own state.In this way,the Armenians were trying to create a state for themselves in the lands of Turkey andAzerbaijan,which they intended to conquer with Russian help.The tsarist Russia was using the Armenians who betrayed their own state as tools in its wars against Iran and the Ottoman Empire.The Russian Empire,having won the war of 1826-1828 against Gajars Iran and the war of 1828-1829 against the Ottoman Empire,implemented massive relocations of Armenians to the newly-invaded NorthAzerbaijani territories (mainly the Iravan,Nakhchivan and Garabagh Khanates).Russia’s goal was to create a durable Christian strip along the borders of Iran and Turkey and to useArmenians again as tools in future invasions of those states.While relocatingArmenians from Iran and Turkey to NorthAzerbaijani lands,the tsarist Russia created all the conditions necessary for them.Namely,the Armenian relocation was entrusted to Armenian officers serving in the Russian army; those relocated were provided with financial resources from the imperial budget and the Russian military accompanied the Armenians up to their future places of settlement.During the initial period,the relocated were settled in the most fertile lands of the Iravan,Nakhchvan and Garabagh Khanates.They were provided with land plots in areas with similar climates to those in their previous settlements in Iran and Turkey.Plots in cities were allocated for those relocated from cities and in villages for those relocated from villages.The relocatedArmenians were relieved of all taxes and duties.They were given interest-free money loans and seeds.The houses and lands of Azerbaijanis,who were at that 580 AZERBAIJAN NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES,A.A.BAKIKHANOV INSTITUTE OF HISTORY I N P L A C E O F A F I N A L W O R D HE WHO CONCEDES LAND FROM HIS NATIVE COUNTRY,REMAINS WITHOUT A MOTHERLAND time in their summer houses,were distributed among most of the relocated Armenians.The relocation of Armenians to Azerbaijani lands caused acute discontent within the local population – Azerbaijanis deprived of their ancestral lands and left without homes.Sometimes popular discontent reached such levels that tsarist government bodies were forced to reconsider.For example,the widespread resentment of the Nakhchivan population and continuous rebellions resulted in the further relocation of 500 Armenian families planted there to Daralayaz.Thus,the relocated Armenians could not settle in the land of Nakhchivan.In all,from the 1820s,during almost 90 years,over 1 million Armenians were relocated to the South Caucasus.They were settled mostly on Azerbaijani territories and South Caucasus lands inhabited mainly by Azerbaijanis.During the First World War,the Armenian inflow to Azerbaijani lands increased even further.The tsarist Russia used the Armenian factor extensively in order to “cleanse” the Caucasus of its Turkic-Muslim population.Armenian terrorist groups,armed and protected by Russia,massacred Azerbaijanis in the territories of the former Iravan,Nakhchivan and Garabagh Khanates.Azerbaijani people,especially the Azerbaijanis of Iravan,Nakhchivan and Garabagh,abandoned their native lands in droves and were forced to migrate to Turkey,Iran and other countries of the world.The South Caucasus became the hottest centre of tension in the world after the relocation of Armenians.Azerbaijan,with very large territories in the South Caucasus,embarked upon the hardest period in its history.Azerbaijanis,the most numerous of the region’s inhabitants suffered massacres and deportations.On May 29,1918 the People’s Republic of Azerbaijan gave its consent to the establishment of an Armenian state with Iravan as its capital,581 AZERBAIJAN NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES,A.A.BAKIKHANOV INSTITUTE OF HISTORY I N P L A C E O F A F I N A L W O R D HE WHO CONCEDES LAND FROM HIS NATIVE COUNTRY,REMAINS WITHOUT A MOTHERLAND without taking into account the opinion of the people and under pressure from bigger states.This marked the establishment of an Armenian state on West Azerbaijani lands,almost 100 years after the relocation of Armenians onto Azerbaijani lands.Thus the Armenians finally achieved their purpose.Yet,this did not suffice… A new stage of Armenian territorial claims against their own neighbours in the South Caucasus began following the establishment of an Armenian state of approximately 9.5 thousand square kilometres,covering the city of Iravan and its surroundings,in 1918.Terrorist Armenian-Dashnak gangs armed with Russian made arms began to conduct mass genoside against the local Turkic-Muslim populations in order to conquer Nakhchivan,Zangazour,Sharur-Daralayaz and Daghlig Garabagh (Nagorno-Karabakh-editor).The Soviet-Bolshevik regime continued imperial Russia’s pro-Armenian and anti-Turkic policy,inherited from Peter I.Receiving every support from Moscow,Armenians soon launched new territorial claims against Azerbaijan.In return for Armenian acceptance of Soviet power,the Bolsheviks agreed to annex West Azerbaijani territories to the newly-established Armenian state.In accordance with a treaty concluded between the Bolsheviks and Armenians on 10 August 1920,an important section of the ancient Azerbaijani land of Sharur-Daralayaz was given to the Armenians without the participation or agreement of the Azerbaijani people.Immediately after this,Dashnaks occupied the south-western part of Zangazour (Mehri Region)with the help of the XI Red Army.Thus the connection between the main part of Azerbaijan and Nakhchivan was cut.The invasion of Mehri also created a direct link between Armenia and Iran.However,the Dashnaks failed to invade Nakhchivan,due to the resolute resistance of the population of Nakhchivan and help from 582 AZERBAIJAN NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES,A.A.BAKIKHANOV INSTITUTE OF HISTORY I N P L A C E O F A F I N A L W O R D HE WHO CONCEDES LAND FROM HIS NATIVE COUNTRY,REMAINS WITHOUT A MOTHERLAND fraternal Turkey.Yet the pro-Armenian and anti-Azerbaijani policy of the Soviet regime resulted in the granting of provincial autonomy to Daghlig Garabagh,as a part of Azerbaijan,with its centre at Shusha city.Thus the Armenians and their supporters in Moscow created a “basis” for future territorial claims against Azerbaijan.More precisely,the “foundation” of today’s Armenian-Azerbaijani Daghlig Garabagh conflict was laid.The Soviet regime and Armenians nested in the Kremlin continued to pursue a policy of expanding Armenian territories at the expense of Azerbaijani lands.That is,in 1922,an additional 379.984 desyatins of land in the Gazakh uezd and 405.000 desyatins of land in the former Zangazour uezd of Azerbaijan were given to Armenians.In 1928,75.904 desyatins of fertile land and 79.208 desyatins of summer quarters and pastures were annexed to Armenia under the pretext of “resolving border conflicts”.In this way the Gazakh uezd lost over half of its summer pastures.In 1929,the Soviet regime broke the conditions of the Kars Treaty and annexed 9 villages of Nakhchivan,a total of 657 square kilometers,to Armenia.This policy of expanding Armenian territories onto Nakhchivan land was continued.In 1938,a large portion of the villages of Sadarak and Karki was given to Armenia.Armenian territories continued to grow at the expense of Azerbaijani land.On the other hand,the Armenians,while constantly expanding their territories onto Azerbaijani land in the Soviet era,began implementing the deportation of Azerbaijanis from their ancestral lands of North-Western Azerbaijan (the present-day territory of the Republic of Arme-nia)again with active help from Moscow.This policy was pursued systematically and deliberately.Namely,Azerbaijanis were deprived of the right to receive education in their own language in their native lands.Thousands of toponyms of Azerbaijani origin were replaced by Armenian names by decrees issued from the centre.Traditional Azerbaijani industrial 583 AZERBAIJAN NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES,A.A.BAKIKHANOV INSTITUTE OF HISTORY I N P L A C E O F A F I N A L W O R D HE WHO CONCEDES LAND FROM HIS NATIVE COUNTRY,REMAINS WITHOUT A MOTHERLAND sectors were eliminated.Azerbaijani cemeteries,with histories going back thousands of years,were transformed into arable lands.Hundreds of caravanserais,mosques,madrasas,minarets,public baths and other historical-architectural monuments were destroyed.Finally,on 23 December 1947,Armenians achieved the signature of a decree to deport Azerbaijanis from their historical-ethnic lands – the territories of the Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic-issued by J.Stalin,Chairman of the USSR Council of Ministers.As a result,over 100 thousand Azerbaijanis were deported from their native lands – areas with the climate of mountainous-summer quarters,to the hot Mil-Mughan plains of Azerbaijan,from 1948-1950.While the resolution signed by J.Stalin defined the period of relocation as 1948-1950,the process of Azerbaijani deportation continued until 1953 and even later,tens of thousands more indigenous people were deprived of their native lands.The entire property of the relocated Azerbaijanis,including their ancient lands and houses,were distributed among Armenians.A majority of the inhumanly deported population perished and died on the roads,in the hot plains of M il-Mughan.The Soviet regime continued the imperial Russian policy of relocating Armenians from abroad to the border regions of Azerbaijan with Iran and Turkey – the former Iravan Khanate.During the Soviet era,Armenians living abroad were relocated to the territories of the present Republic of Armenia (the former Iravan Khanate)on numerous occasions.From 1946-1948 alone,over 100 thousand Armenians were relocated from abroad and settled on Armenian SSR territories (158,365).The local Azerbaijani residents living in the former Iravan Khanate faced massacres and were forced to abandon their native historical-ethnic lands which caused deliberate demographic changes in favour of Armenians.584 AZERBAIJAN NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES,A.A.BAKIKHANOV INSTITUTE OF HISTORY I N P L A C E O F A F I N A L W O R D HE WHO CONCEDES LAND FROM HIS NATIVE COUNTRY,REMAINS WITHOUT A MOTHERLAND Hence,almost all the ancestors of the Armenians currently living on the territories of the former Iravan Khanate (the present-day Republic of Armenia)are those once relocated from Iran and Turkey,or more recently from other countries – mainly Syria,Greece,Libya,Bulgaria and Romania.The Azerbaijanis who survived the deportations of 1948-1950 and who did not abandon their native lands suffered massive massacres in 1988 – on the eve of the collapse of the Soviet Union-by Armenian armed gangs and were displaced from their historical lands.Thus,having succeeded in establishing a state for themselves on the lands of North-Western Azerbaijan – the former Iravan Khanate-in 1918 and constituting an ethnic minority in these places,Armenians trans-formed Armenia into a mono-ethnic country 70 years later – in 1988.This left Azerbaijanis,who had provided Armenians with territories to create a state for themselves in the Azerbaijani lands-in the Iravan Khanate-deprived of their Motherland,where they had been living for thousands of years.Following this,Armenian armed groups violated the internation-ally-recognised borders of Azerbaijan and thrust into the country’s interior.On 26 February 1992,Armenian bandits carried out the Khojali Genocide against the Azerbaijani nation in front of the whole world.The city of Khojali was razed to the ground.Over 20% of Azerbaijani territories were invaded.More than 1 million Azerbaijanis became refugees in their own Motherland.This is the real and recently occurring picture of the historical truth that some Western politicians “do not see”,or rather,do not want to see as they exercise Christian solidarity with the Armenians.As the policy of discrimination between Azerbaijanis and Armenians continues in a world of double standards and the refugee lifestyle of over 585 AZERBAIJAN NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES,A.A.BAKIKHANOV INSTITUTE OF HISTORY I N P L A C E O F A F I N A L W O R D HE WHO CONCEDES LAND FROM HIS NATIVE COUNTRY,REMAINS WITHOUT A MOTHERLAND 1 million Azerbaijanis in their own native lands continues to be ignored,the Azerbaijani people will be wary of pro-Armenian western politicians’ statements about “human rights” and “democracy” and will continue its just struggle for the occupied lands of the Motherland.Because the bitter historical experience of 1918 has shown to the Azerbaijani people that part of the Motherland can no longer be gifted.He who concedes land from his Motherland will be left without a Motherland.Yagub Mahmudov Honoured Scientist,Corresponding
