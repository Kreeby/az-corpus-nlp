ISMET ISMAIL oglu GAIBOY
08. 10.1942 —  20. 11.1991
The lines o f this book are paid with blood. Its author 
Prosecutor - General o f the Azerbaijan Republic Ismet Ismail 
oglu Gaibov fell prey to Armenian terrorists on November 20, 
1991.
Long ago, together with other prominent representatives of 
the Azerbaijan intelligentsia, he was put on the “black lis f’ o f  
those sentenced to death. He vvös hunted for. They didn’t 
forgive him the fa d  that under his authority the horrible details 
of banishing the Azerbaijanis from Khankendy and Azerbaijan 
villages o f the mountaineous part o f Karabakh and many of 
their crimes began to reveal. Murderers, who got used to not 
being punished, were afraid of him.
Together with I. Gaibov 22 men, who flew in the helicopter 
over Karabakh, died - Azerbaijanis, Russians, Kazakhs... They 
flew on a peacemaking mission - and paid with their own lives 
for it..
Terrorism is unaware o f such notions as honour and 
nobility. In two months after this tragedy the terrorists shot 
down another peaceful Azerbaijan helicopter. Merited pupils o f 
Dr. Gebbels informed the world that there was the weapons 
aboard the helicopter.
There were more than 30 innocent victims - among them 
women and children. And the list o f the killed, wounded, 
beastly disfigured Azerbaijanians much enlarged since this book 
was published.
It is painful and difficult to write about it. But it is 
necessary. Since there is no place for terrorism in the civilised 
society because it is equal to suicide for the people whose 
representatives carry it out
Bitter lines of Ismet Gaibov's book are filled with care 
about peace and tranquility for all our children despite their 
nationality.

Reports on explosions, arsons, 
murders, hostages in Nagorny 
Karabakh and bordering on 
Armenia azeri regions have, 
unfortunately, become usual in our 
everyday life. T h e  terror 
unleashed here  serves 1o purpose 
of aggressive-minded circtcs of the 
neighboring republic and is 
dircctcd 10 forceful annexation of 
N agorno-K arabakh Autonomous 
Region of Azerbaijan to Armenia. 
And the non-declared war which 
the Armenian militants have been 
waging on the territory of our 
republic for four years is its direct 
cousequence. Armed to the teeth 
and sponsored chiefly by foreign 
Armenian diaspora these militants 
undergo special training before 
they are sent to Azerbaijan. After 
that they sow death and sorrow, 
These thugs and their ideological 
inspirers rob, kill and burn under 
the safe cloak of propaganda. 300 
newspapers and magazines pub­
lished throughout the world, as 
well as soviet mass media, 
disposed to biased coverage of the 
Nagorny Karabakh events, are at 
their service.
And it is not of course by mere 
chance that after each bloody 
conflict provoked here by 
Armenian terrorists all this 
journalist stuff raises the roof in 
the press screaming on the human
rights violations in Azerbaijan. 
Meanwhile, all necessary steps are 
being undertaken to fear the 
people of Nagorny Karabakh and 
bordering on Armenia regions out 
of their homeland.
Just take a proper look at these 
pictures that can serve as a good 
example of the crimes committed 
by the bandits on azeri land. One 
can't look at these voiceless 
illustrations of Armenian terrorists" 
atrocities without a pain in his 
heart...
Look at these photos and you 
will feel ihe pain and grief of the 
people who lost their relatives and 
sorrow of the children who lost 
their Moms and Dads (parents)...
One must lose his human nature 
to lock a whole family in a shed 
and set it to fire, 80-year-o ld  man 
and 2-month-old baby included. 
This happened in Baganis Ayrum 
village of Kazakh region of 
Azerbaijan. W hat was the essence 
of the so-called 'human rights 
protection mission' of the criminals 
who killed at night 6 residents of 
Garadagly village of Martuny 
region of Azerbaijan, out of whom 
3 were later burnt.
T h e  tragedy that is now 
underway in Azerbaijan has its 
bloody history. Terrorist 
Armenian groupings started to 
appear in early 7 0 s  in the Middle
East. A little bit later during the 
Civil W ar in Lebanon, Armenian 
revolutionary organization had 
been formed on their basis that 
had won its spurs by 
assassinations of Turkish 
diplomats in various countries of 
the world. You can get acquainted 
with incomplete list of their crimcs 
in this book. W e'd like only to 
mention the fact that the Armenian 
terrorism had long ago exceeded 
the limits of simple terrorist acts. 
Its 'godfathers ' put forward today 
their territorial claims to the 
neighbors daydreaming of the so- 
called 'G reat Armenia'. According 
to Anri Papazyan, one of the 
leaders of Armenian nationalist 
movement, 'Armenian people has 
historical lands situated on borders 
of the Caucasus and today we 
have clear-cut territorial claims'... 
He said these words on July 15, 
1987 in Gamk' newspaper that is 
'Dashnaktsutyn 's ' body.
Now we think you'll get better 
idea of w hat's  going on in 
Azerbaijan these 4 years. We 
would like only to emphasize that 
the realization of this crazy idea 
of 'T h e  G reat Armenia' was 
accompanied with r e a l ' efforts to 
set up a multinational Armenian 
state at the expense of the rights 
and territory of azeri people. All 
this has already led to overall 
deportation of azeris from 
Armenia, their ouster from 
Stepanakert which is the regional 
center of Azerbaijan Republic.
In order  to reach its 
annexationist goals Armenia set up 
illegal military formations, 
including the so-called Armenian 
National Army, disarmed regional 
departments of the Interior, 
assaulted military units in order  to 
seize the weapons, and carried out 
vigorous saboteurs and terrorists 
training projects in special camps. 
These  people afterwards carry
and bandit attacks and subjcct to 
fire peaceful azeri villages out 
towns. According to operations 
reports  on July 1991 230 people 
were killed including 24 
servicemen and 33 militiamen.
Special attention was attached 
to Armenian expansionist plans to 
Chaykend village of Khanlar 
region, situated 20 km from the 
old Gandja. Increase of tension 
here  grew together with that in 
Nagorny K arabakh w here emissars 
from Armenia including notorious 
deputies Z. Balayan and J. 
Murad van frequented since late 
1986.
T hey  spread discord and 
national hatred among the local 
people calling them for secession 
of Armenian populated villages 
from Azerbaijan.
T h e  Armenians there w ere told 
that in the near future all the 
Armenian populated villages of 
Khanlar region would join 
Shaumyan (now G heranboy) 
region of Azerbaijan in o rd e r  to 
join later N agorny Karabakh so 
that eventually together with this 
region they could be incorporated 
into Armenia. M oney was 
collected to purchase the w eapons 
for the militants w ho beginning 
since Sept. 5 , 1989 have been 
airlifted from Armenia by 
helicopters with no wing marks.
Meanwhile with every passing 
day the actions of the militants 
became more and more impudent. 
T hey  not only launched sallies to 
the neighboring azeri villages 
(residential areas) but also 
managed to turn C haykend  and 
nearby Armenian M artunashen 
village into the strong point of the 
band formations.
During the passport check p ro ­
cedures warfare stores, landings 
for helicopters were discovered, 
that were used for transportation 
of terrorist groups and arms
batches from Armenia. Terrorists 
voiced their presence in Khanlar 
region on August 10, 1990 by 
attacking intertown bus killing 17 
and wounding 15 passengers.
Among the victims of Armenian 
Terrorists there 1 were the 
Armenians themselves those who 
showed common sense.
On November 30 last year 
Azeri representatives of Khanlar 
region who expressed their 
willingness to negotiate with 
neighboring Armenians from 
Martunashen village were 
subjected to the militants' fire; 4 
people were killed and two 
wounded. Two more people were 
taken hostage out of whom one 
man died of tortures. Later the 
bandits blocked the roods between 
azeri villages of the region, were 
setting up military outposts on the 
road from Khanlar to Kelbadjar, 
blew up the water pipeline 
supplying Gandja city with 
drinking water. T he ir  further 
impudent and unpunished actions 
threatened the vita! activity of the 
whole western zone of Azerbaijan 
with more than a million 
population.
U nder such conditions the 
republican law enforcement 
authorities with the assistance of 
the USSR Interior troops launched 
on April 30, 1991 the passport- 
check procedures in Chaykend 
and Martunashen villages thus 
fulfilling 'T h e  U SSR President's  
Decree on disarmament of illegal 
militarized formations'.
Af first when the military 
servicemen and militiamen 
approached  these villages they 
were met with accurate large- 
calibre machine-gun, grenade 
launcher and submachine-gun fire. 
Terrorists in Chaykend resorted to 
their favourite meihod: they put 
forward their women and children 
in front of the armoured personnel
carriers, took hostage 13 
militarymen and one local guide. 
Realizing that they  will be 
disarmed the bandits resorted to a 
' scorched-earth  policy' trying to 
burn Martunashen village. Having 
aggravated the life of people in 
Armenian villages they forced 
them out of their homeland. 
Boasting of their piousness they 
eventually resorted to sacrilege by 
turning the churches to the 
weapons stores. One of such 
stores was recently revealed in 
Kylychbak village of Askeran 
region of N agorno-K arabakh  
w here 6 mortars, 16 home-m ade 
hand mines, about 140 grenades, 
communication devices were 
concealed. Of course, all this was 
not stored for religious services.
It's worth mentioning that long 
time before these events the 
Supreme Soviet and the President 
of Azerbaijan had several times 
warned the leadership of the 
country that armed Armenian 
military formations were sent to 
azeri territory and at the same 
time there were no azeri military 
formations of the like. Various 
fact finding missions of the central 
law enforcement bodies witnessed 
this fact and called on the 
Armenian leadership for 
disbandment of the military 
formations, demanded to put an 
end to the military interference 
into internal affairs of the 
sovereign republic. However, this 
advice was not given proper 
attention from the neighboring side 
and the union government didn't 
always take firm stand in the issue 
of territorial integrity of 
Azerbaijan. As it is well-known, 
lack of necessary steps on 
disarmament of bandit groupings 
has brought to escalation of 
aggression of Armenian extremists, 
who have been waging a real w ar 
against the azeri people. In April
and May of this year  they 
subjected Shusha, Kazakh, 
Sadarak, Kubatlv, Lachin regions 
of Azerbaijan to artillery and 
missile fire killing innocent people: 
men, women and children.
It was the terrorists' fault that 
11 were regions of Azerbaijan and 
Nakhichevan Autonomous
Republic w ere involved in the 
military actions. Apparently, the 
hangmen think that the more 
people die as a  result of 'T iie  
Great Armenia' project the closcr 
they are  to their goal and then it 
is c lear  why their ideologists 
advocate frantic racism by bringing 
up whole generations in the spirit 
of  hatred toward Azerbaijanis. It
is characteristic that new leaders 
in Armenia appeared  on the wave 
of this 'national-patriotic ' 
movement with territorial claims to 
Azerbaijan but we won't to believe 
that the common sense will win. 
Undoubtedly, those who still 
believes in false propaganda 
tomorrow will learn the truth 
about all the crimes committed by 
Armenian nationalist militants and 
will understand the danger of the 
“ plague of now adays” called the 
Armenian terrorism.
T hat is why we decided io 
enclose here the chronology of 
the terrorist acts committed by 
Armenians from 1973 to 1985.

Armenian Terrorism
Baku-Publishing House 
"Azerbaijan"-1992
Order 1048. Circulation 3.000. 
Baku, Publishing House “Azerbaijan”.
(t is a wreckage of the NfiA (M inistry of Internal A ffairs) troops' “ MI Я” helicopter N 72. 
On the 20 th of novemher, |Q<>( this transport machine was shot by the big-calibre  
machine gun landing to Armenian village of Karabend Among the wreckage there are 
remains of the passengers - members of the observer comission of Russia and Kazakhstan, 
the militaries, the high state’s men of Azerbaijan, inall - 22 men. Nobody has survived!
“There will he no peace und tranquility in the country till the human bkxxl is 
shed unpunished” - with these words ismet Gaibov ended his book.
There is no peace and no tranquility... And the country it is written about no 
longer exists. Within several months since the publication of the first edition of this 
book the USSR ceased to exist. Hut the terrorism still exists, the people still die.
The future o f the hastily set up Commonwealth o f Independent Slates is vague. 
But the places o f armed ethnic conflicts - and not only on the territory of CIS ~ are 
distinctly seen. Their bloody beginning is Karabakh - the place where 
national-terrorism lifted up its head, where it was promoted to the rank o f high 
policy, where it was sanctified using high words.
Now the ideologists o f nationalists master a new stage. They are to stir up the 
religious feud. And more often we hear and read about the notorious "tslamic threat". 
Though any reasonable man seems to understand that there is nc religion in the 
world which would call the believers to commit evil - they try to present Islam as the 
religion of evil.
/Is any theories appealing to vile and dark human instincts these ones have a certain 
success.
It is painful to write about it at the end of the second millennium A. D. But 
today the vile instincts multiplied by the huge technical power are hundred times 
dreadful. Let them out and not only Karabakh and CIS but the whole earth 
civilisation will be threatened.
The world is under the threat o f being ‘ destroyed when terrorism and feud of 
religions and peoples become a policy.
God forbid us such fate!
