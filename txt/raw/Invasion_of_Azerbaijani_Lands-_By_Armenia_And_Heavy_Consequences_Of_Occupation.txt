region of Nagorno Karabakh has been an integral part of Azerbaijan.In the past 200 years,the demographic content has changed from predominantly Azeri to about 80% Armenian,due to the actions of the Russian rulers during that time period.Starting with the Imperialist Russian Empire,and continuing through the domination by the Soviet Union,the Rus-sians continued a practice of plaching Armenians,which were moved to the South Caucasus,into Nagorno Karabakh,ultimately creating a majority Armenian population in these territories.During most of this history,Armenians and Azeris lived peaceably together in Nagorno Karabakh,and inter-marrying.During the mid-1900’s,this co-habitation extended from Yerevan to Baku.Then in the late 1980’s,as the Soviet Union began to disintegrate,and the economy of the South Caucasus became desperate,scuffles broke out between groups of Azeris and groups of Armenians.At the end of the 1980s,a movement for state independence started in Azerbaijan,and this imme-diately caused Gorbachov,President of the USSR,to send troops into Baku,those troops being led by Armenians in the Russian infantry.The infantry killed and brutalized hundreds of Azeris,including hundreds of women and children.This crushed Azeri independence until the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991.With the fall of the Soviet Union,territorial claims of Armenia against Azerbaijan intensified,and Armenian armed forces encroached on Azerbaijan in order to realize these claims.At that time,rogue armed iii forces consisting of separatist Armenians were organized in Nagorno Karabakh by Serge Sargisyan and Robert Kocharian with the sole pur-pose of ethnically cleansing the Nagorno Karabakh region of Azerbaijan.Simultaneously,the 366th Russian armored regiment had been stationed in the region under the command of an Armenian major Ohanyan.This armored regiment quickly became integrated into the Armenian forces under the command of Sargisyan and Kocharian.These combined forces formed the main military strength of the Armenian aggression in Nagorno Karabakh and surrounding provinces.Thus,during those times,Sargisyan,Kocharian,and Ohanyan be-came the main leaders of the Armenian aggression.Kocharian and Sar-gisyan later became Presidents of Armenia within different periods,and Ohanyan became the Minister of Defense.During the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict,ethnic cleansing was carried out and numerous atrocities were exerted by Armenia onto the Azeris,the most egregious of which occurred at Khojali.The Khojali massacre has been compared to Srebrenica and Darfur in its intensity and inhu-manity.This book is a seminal work which compiles,in one place,the de-tailed evidence of the Armenian aggression,the damage done,and the blatant atrocities which occurred.It also compiles the damages which have occurred at the hands of the Armenians from the wartime period up until the present.This book serves humanity by its detailed documentation of the atrocities and damages,in one reference volume,which may be used for appropriate,international,legal actions.Solomon Ortiz Former Member of Congress and Chairman,Armed Services

occupation of 20 percent of the Azerbaijani territories,including the former Nagorno Karabakh Autonomous Region and seven adjoining districts.Twenty thousand Azerbaijanis were killed; fifty thousand were wounded,with varying degrees of injuries; and over five thousand were taken captive or are missing.The ethnic-cleansing policy of Armenia in its own ter-ritory and in the occupied Azerbaijani territories has created over one million Azerbaijani refugees and internally displaced persons.More than nine hundred residential areas have been destroyed and plundered in the war,and nine million square meters of houses of civil-ians,state enterprises,and social facilities have been destroyed.The cost of damages due to the occupation has been calculated as tens of billions of dollars,but precise information is not available.Azer-baijan has suffered direct and indirect losses.By «losses,» we mean the damages inflicted on the state itself and on its citizens,organizations,and commercial structures.Unless the occupied territories are liberated,the amount of losses will continue to grow year by year.Talks have been underway for many years for a peaceful liberation of the Azerbaijani territories from the occupation,but if the talks yield no results,Azerbaijan,in conformity with international legal norms,will use its right to self-defense to end the occupation and to restore its sovereignty in the territories under oc-cupation.vii Invasion of Azerbaijani Lands by Armenia and Heavy Consequences of Occupation The Republic of Azerbaijan has the right to appeal to international courts,bring suits,and receive war indemnity for its losses.Therefore,it is time to calculate the losses that have followed the aggression and occupation of the Azerbaijani territories.Until now,there has been no thorough research of the international and legal aspects of payment to Azerbaijan for financial and moral damages.We should consider it a matter of national importance to conduct research into the political,in-ternational,legal,and economic aspects of the Armenian aggression against Azerbaijan,as well as to investigate the international and legal basis for payment for the losses suffered.Thus,one of the main issues is making Armenia legally responsible—according to international law— for compensating for material and moral damages.This study of the problem will aid in securing a fair solution.At the same time,the political and legal aspects of the territorial claims of Armenia to Azerbaijan,its armed aggression,and the occu-pation of Nagorno Karabakh and adjoining districts will be examined.A range of issues regarding the payment of the losses Azerbaijan has suffered has not yet been the subject of comprehensive studies,and this study attempts to do that.Because of the topicality and originality of this study,it will strength-en Azerbaijan’s position and its worldwide credibility,and will verify that the Nagorno Karabakh region of Azerbaijan and adjoining districts have been occupied by Armenia.viii 1 1 HISTORICAL AND GEOPOLITICAL ROOTS OF THE ARMENIAN-AZERBAIJANI CONFLICT OVER NAGORNO KARABAKH The Armenian-Azerbaijani conflict over Nagorno Karabakh erupted when Armenia launched an armed aggression against Azerbaijan.Eth-nic Azerbaijanis were deported from their historical lands—presen-day Republic of Armenia—within several months in 1988-1989.This was the continuation of a policy of acquiring new territories by force,which started with illegal actions of separatist Armenians in the Na-gorno Karabakh region of the country.The Armenian government supported the actions of separatists with decisions that ran against international legal norms and put forward groundless claims against Azerbaijan.Among the decisions were res-olutions of the Supreme Soviet of Armenia,«On merging Armenia with Karabakh,» of December 1,1989,and of August 23,1990,on the state sovereignty of Armenia.With these documents,Armenia contradicted international legal norms addressing the territory of another state; in them,the Nagorno Karabakh region of Azerbaijan was declared an «inseparable part of 2 Invasion of Azerbaijani Lands by Armenia and Heavy Consequences of Occupation Armenia.» These resolutions were realized in Armenia’s armed aggres-sion against Azerbaijan.Illegal,armed formations made up of mer-cenaries were widely used in battles against Azerbaijan.The armed aggression was also accompanied by acts of terror by the Armenian special services and international Armenian terrorist organizations,along the frontier and borders as well as far from those areas.In late 1991 and early 1992,large-scale military operations of the Armenian armed forces were within the administrative borders of the Nagorno Karabakh Autonomous Region,but in May of 1992,the military opera-tions crossed the administrative borders and spread to other districts of Azerbaijan.Since the armed aggression of Armenia,the former Nagorno Kara-bakh Autonomous Region and seven adjoining districts,including a number of villages of frontier and border districts-totaling 20 per-cent of the territories of Azerbaijan-have been occupied.The parties signed a cease-fire agreement on 12 May 1994 with the mediation of the Russian Federation,and now negotiations are underway through the mediation of the OSCE Minsk Group for a peaceful resolution of the conflict.It must be emphasized that the Armenian-Azerbaijani conflict over Nagorno Karabakh has historical and geopolitical roots.Thus,the foun-dation of this conflict was laid as a «time bomb» long before 1988-to be precise,in the early nineteenth century.As early as the end of the seventeenth and early eighteenth centu-ries,to divide the lands of the Ottoman Empire and for access to the Mediterranean Sea and eastward,tsarist Russia repeatedly waged wars against Turkey and Iran.Finally,in 1813 and 1828,the Gulustan and Turkmanchay treaties were signed,respectively.After the signing,in-justice against Azerbaijan was legalized,and the Azerbaijani lands were divided between the two states.As a tragic outcome of the treaties,the people of Azerbaijan were divided,and the historic lands of Azerbaijan were partitioned.The Turkmanchay treaty laid the foundation for far-reaching aggres-sive activities and future tragedies.Beginning in 1828,there was a mass resettlement of Armenians from Iran and Turkey into the Russian-occu-pied Transcaucasia (the South Caucasus).3 Elkhan Suleymanov/Vurgun Suleymanov Two years after the war,from 1828 to 1830,over forty thousand Armenians from Iran and eighty-four thousand from Turkey were re-settled in the South Caucasus.These Armenians settled in the strate-gically important Yelizavetpol (Ganja)and Iravan regions.Russian scholar N.N.Shavrov wrote,«The mountainous part of Yelizavetpol region and the shore of the Lake Goycha were settled by those Arme-nians.» Shavrov further wrote in 1908 that «over one million of 1.3m Armenians in the Caucasus are not natives of the region and were resettled by us.» [1] Thus,the mass resettlement of Armenians to the South Caucasus,including to Nagorno Karabakh by tsarist Russia,radically changed the demographic balance in the region and laid the foundation for future territorial claims by the Armenians.Because of the policies of tsarist Russia and then of the Soviet Union,the demographics of the area changed fundamentally over two hundred years.The Azerbaijanis were forced to leave their historical and native lands.In the twentieth century,they were subjected to at least five per-secutions,deportations,and removals from their native lands.In 1905-1907,Armenians carried out bloody battles against Azerbaijanis across Azerbaijan as well as against native Azerbaijani settlements on the present-day Armenian territory.Hundreds of settlements were razed,and thousands of Azerbaijanis were killed.From late December 1917 to June 1918,two hundred Azerbaijani settlements in the former Iravan khanate were set on fire and destroyed.Under the guise of the Bolshevik flag and the cause of fighting anti-rev-olutionary elements,armed gangs led by Stepan Shaumyan launched on March 1918 a terrifying plan in Baku for the genocide of Azerbaijanis.A considerable part of Baku was reduced to ruins within a short period.This genocide against Azerbaijanis was implemented with extraordi-nary cruelty in Baku,Shamakhi,Guba,Garabakh,Zangazur,Nakhchi-van,Lankaran,and other regions.Civilians were killed in mass num-bers on ethnic grounds—for being Azerbaijanis.Houses were set on fire,and monuments of national culture,schools,hospitals,mosques,and other public property was destroyed.Over this period,the Arme-nian forces killed more than one hundred thousand Azerbaijanis in the South Caucasus.4 Invasion of Azerbaijani Lands by Armenia and Heavy Consequences of Occupation After 28 May 1918-that is,after the declaration of its independence— Azerbaijan faced fresh territorial claims from the Armenians.To end the territorial claims of the Armenians and the armed attacks against the Azer-baijanis,Azerbaijan decided to yield the territory of the Yerevan khanate to the Armenians.Thus Armenia,as a state with Yerevan as its capital,was established on historical Azerbaijani lands.However,even after this,Armenia did not repudiate the territorial claims to Azerbaijan and forc-ibly expelled Azerbaijanis from their historical lands.Finally,because of armed aggression,the region of Zangazur was occupied,and Armenia now had a common border with Iran.With the establishment and annulment of the Trans-Caucasus Fed-eration under the USSR,and throughout the existence of Azerbaijan and Armenia,the Azerbaijani territories were again handed over to Armenia,under the guise of the demarcation of borders.Native Azer-baijanis were forced to abandon their homes under different pretexts.Ethnic cleansing and the deportation of Azerbaijanis from Armenia also proceeded with the support of the Soviet leadership after World War II.For example,under Decree 4083,issued by I.V.Stalin on 23 December 1947,«On the resettlement of the collective farmers and other Azerbaijani population from the Armenian SSR to the Kur-Araz lowlands of the Azerbaijani SSR,» and under the 10 March 1948 (no.754)decision of the USSR Council of Ministers,«On the measures related to the resettlement of collective farmers and other Azerbai-jani population from the Armenian SSR to the Kur-Araz lowlands of the Azerbaijani SSR,» up to 150,000 Azerbaijanis were deported from their historical lands.Despite the success of tsarist Russia in drastically changing the demographic situation in the South Caucasus throughout the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries,over 575,000 Azerbaijanis lived there in 1918,or more than one-third of the Arme-nian population.Armenia established this as a state on nine thousand square kilometers of land.Later Armenia’s territory increased at the expense of a decrease in the Azerbaijani lands from 114,000 to 86,000 square kilometers,and open and covert ethnic cleansing under various pretexts was conducted in those territories.Because of official Yerevan’s consistent and con-tinuous ethnic-cleansing policies,as of now,not a single ethnic Azer-5 Elkhan Suleymanov/Vurgun Suleymanov baijani remains there.The next stage of the ethnic-cleansing policy and the obliteration of all traces that the present-day Armenian territories belonged to the Azerbaijanis began in November 1988.With backing and sanctions by official government bodies,over 250,000 Azerbaijanis were deported from their historical lands-from the current Armenian territory—within a short period.This tragic stage of ethnic-cleansing policy accompanied by mass deportation included the torture and mur-der of Azerbaijanis.Because of ethnic cleansing,216 Azerbaijanis were killed—the ma-jority of them women,children,and the elderly.Forty-nine froze in the mountains while trying to escape,41 were cruelly beaten and killed,35 were killed after lengthy tortures,11 were set on fire alive,16 were gunned down,10 people died because of tortures,2 men were killed by doctors at the hospital,2 men were beheaded after repeated waterboarding,hanging,electric shocks,and other inhumane treatment.Cruel crimes against eth-nic Azerbaijanis were carri-ed out especially in Gukark,Kalinin,Gorus,Stepanavan,Vardenis (Basarkecar),Masis (Zangibasar),Spitak,Ararat,Kirovakan,Ijevan,Krasnoselo,Yegnadzor,Amasiya,Gafan,Abovyan,Sisian,Sevan,Noyemberyan,and Megri.[2] These crimes committed were premeditated acts of official Yerevan.Thus,the deportation of the Azerbaijanis from their historic lands and the attacks against their residences were aided by officials of the Ar-menian government—the police,the staff of the prosecutor’s offices,and secretaries of district party committees.There is no doubt that the leadership of the USSR-in particular,Mikhail Gorbachev—was aware of the criminal activities of the Armenian leadership.However,the So-viet leadership did not order an investigation into the ethnic cleansing,and organizers and executors of the crimes were not brought to court.In conformity with international legal norms,any of the following acts committed with the intention to destroy,in whole or in part,a na-tional,ethnical,racial,or religious group are considered to be genocide:killing members of the group; causing serious bodily or mental harm to the members of the group; deliberately inflicting on the group condi-tions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part.[3] Consequently,in conformity with international legal norms,acts of the Armenian official structures against ethnic Azerbaijanis must 6 Invasion of Azerbaijani Lands by Armenia and Heavy Consequences of Occupation be assessed as genocidal crimes.Armenian authorities were not content with the deportation of ethnic Azerbaijanis from their historical lands,but also carried out armed aggression against them from 1988 to 1993.Along with the Armenian armed forces,mercenary groups comprising ethnic Armenians,citizens of various countries,and international Armenian ter-rorists took part in fights against the Azerbaijanis.After Armenia’s military aggression against Azerbaijan,20 percent of Azerbaijani lands,including the former Nagorno Karabakh Autono-mous Region as well as seven adjoining districts (Lachin,Kalbajar,Ag-dam,Fuzuly,Jabrail,Gubadli,Zangilan),have been occupied.More-over,several villages of Azerbaijan in the border districts with Armenia (Nakhchivan,Gazakh,Tartar,Agjabadi,Gadabay)have been occupied or have been gravely devastated in Agstafa,Beylagan,and Tovuz.As of now,Nagorno Karabakh,including the adjoining areas (one of the two occupied villages of the Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic,80 of the occupied 81 villages in Agdam,54 of the 76 occupied villages in Fu-zuly,13 villages of Tartar,and 7 of the occupied 12 villages in Gazakh),are still under occupation.To achieve a peaceful solution to the Armenian-Azerbaijani conflict over Nagorno Karabakh,in March 1992 the OSCE Minsk Group was set up,and the United Nations mandated that this group find a resolu-tion to the conflict.Later,a co-chairmanship of the OSCE Minsk Group,comprising Russia,the United States,and France,was formed.In 1997-1998,the co-chairs put forward three proposals for the resolution of the conflict,but these proposals were not adopted.Since 2007,the Azerbaijani and Armenian presidents have had talks on the Madrid Principles drawn up by the OSCE Minsk Group co-chairs that envisage key principles for the resolution of the conflict.The presidents of the United States,Russia,and France adopted a joint statement on July 10,2009,at the G8 summit in L’Aquila.This statement emphasized the importance of resolving the conflict based on the 1975 COMMISSION ON SECURITY AND COOPERATION IN EUROPE (CSCE)Helsinki Final Act,addressing non-use of force,territorial integrity,and the equal rights and self-determination of peoples.[4] However,no progress was made in the talks due to Armenia’s non-constructive position.Therefore,on June 16,2010,at the G8 summit 7 Elkhan Suleymanov/Vurgun Suleymanov in Muskoka,Canada,the presidents of the nations in the OSCE Minsk Group co-chairmanship again issued a joint statement,calling the sides to take the next step and complete the work on the basic principles to enable the drafting of a peace agreement to begin.The statement once again confirmed that the resolution of the conflict should be based on the principles envisaged in the CSCE Helsinki Final Act.The following proposals were in the L’Aquila statement:• Return of the territories surrounding the Nagorno Karabakh to Azerbaijani control; • An interim status for the Nagorno Karabakh providing guaran tees for security and self-governance; • A corridor linking Armenia to Nagorno Karabakh; • Future determination of the final legal status of Nagorno Kara bakh through a legally binding expression of will; • The right of all internally displaced persons and refugees to return to their former places of residence; • International security guarantees,including a peacekeeping operation.[5] Finally,the chairpersons of the co-chair countries issued another statement on 26 May 2011 at the G8 Deauville (France)Summit.They reiterated the importance of resolving this conflict based on the Hel-sinki Final Act and elements outlined in joint declarations in L’Aquila in July 2009 and Muskoka in June 2010.In their Deauville statement,the presidents of the co-chairing coun-tries called on the presidents of Azerbaijan and Armenia to demonstrate political will by finalizing the basic principles in their upcoming summit in June.[6] However,the Kazan meeting held on 24 June 2011,between the Azerbaijani and Armenian presidents with the mediation of the Rus-sian president,did not produce favorable results.The presidents content-ed themselves with a statement that mutual agreements were reached on a number of issues and that the resolution of those issues would lead to the birth of a condition for the endorsement of key principles.When intensive negotiations were underway for resolution of the conflict,Armenia initiated cease-fire violations,which resulted in an 8 Invasion of Azerbaijani Lands by Armenia and Heavy Consequences of Occupation increase in the killing of civilians-in particular,children.Armenia has recently chosen children as its targets along the frontline areas.Thus,a dog toy filled with explosives was placed into the Tovuz River,which flows through the Azerbaijani village of Alibayli from Armenia.It ex-ploded on 14 July and killed Sahmaliyeva Aygun,born in 1998.Fariz Badalov,a nine-year old boy,was killed on 8 March 2011 by a sniper of the Armenian armed forces stationed in the occupied Agdam District of Azerbaijan.These and other incidents indicate that Armenia commits crimes against humanity by targeting underage children and intentionally derailing peace talks.In the statements of the OSCE Minsk Group co-chair countries,no distinction is made between the aggressor country and the country sub-jected to aggression.The aggressor was not instructed to liberate im-mediately and unconditionally the territories under occupation accord-ing to international legal norms,and no political pressure was exerted on the aggressor to reach this objective.Instead,the presidents of the co-chair countries lay the responsibility of resolving the conflict on the presidents of Azerbaijan and Armenia by calling the sides to make mu-tual compromises,stating that the group would stand ready to back any peace option they agreed to.One of the major reasons the co-chair countries remain neutral in the resolution of the conflict is geopolitical.The Caucasus is both one of the most turbulent regions in the world and rich in natural resources.The South Caucasus-the three independent states of Azerbaijan,Arme-nia,and Georgia-is a strategic region for Russia,Turkey,and Iran,and the strategic paths of North-South,East-West pass through this region.Interests of many states clash in the South Caucasus.Russia views this region as a «priority of its foreign policy»; Iran sees it as a zone of «state security»; and the United States and its allies see it as a zone of «national security.» The routes of natural energy resources (Baku-Supsa and the Baku-Tbilisi-Jeyhan oil pipelines and the Baku-Tbilisi-Erzurum gas pipe-line)from the Caspian Basin to world markets go through the South Caucasian republics of Azerbaijan and Georgia.For the energy security of EU countries,the transportation of natural gas from the Azerbaijani section of the Caspian Sea and the Central Asia through the alternative 9 Elkhan Suleymanov/Vurgun Suleymanov routes are strategically important,which can be seen in the clash of inter-ests of the power centers around the South Caucasus region.Moreover,the South Caucasus has been allocated a strategic role in organizing a transcontinental transport route (TRASECA)that will unite the Far East,Central Asia,Middle East,and Europe.Because the South Caucasus is a strategic region,throughout his-tory,various empires have waged war to reign over it,and when it was under the rule of any empire,there was peace and security.When it became free again,different ethnic groups struggled to capture new territories.The aggression against Azerbaijan erupted after Arme-nia’s groundless territorial claims against Azerbaijan when the USSR weakened and collapsed.The aggression was an integral part of Mos-cow’s official policy to keep the South Caucasus under its sphere of influence.Thus,as the co-chairs of the OSCE Minsk Group,Russia,the United States,and France have their own geostrategic interests in the South Caucasus,Russia is trying to regain its lost positions after the collapse of the USSR by strengthening and reviving its hegemony in the region.And the United States and the European Union are implementing trans-national projects for the transportation of energy resources from the Caspian Basin to try to augment their positions in the region.Armenian politicians describe the military aggression against Azer-baijan and the occupation of the Azerbaijani territories as «the national liberation movement of the people of Nagorno Karabakh for self-deter-mination.» When saying «the people ofthe Nagorno Karabakh,» Arme-nians have in mind the ethnic Armenians residing in the mountainous area of Karabakh,a region of Azerbaijan.However,prior to the conflict,40,688 ethnic Azerbaijanis and 145,450 ethnic Armenians were living in the former Nagorno Karabakh region,according to a 1989 popula-tion census in the USSR.[7] Therefore,the Armenian population in the Nagorno Karabakh region can in no way be described as «the people of Nagorno Karabakh.» There are ethnic Armenians and ethnic Azerbaijanis there,but the people of Armenia have determined everyone’s fate within the borders of the present-day Republic of Armenia.However,not just one seg-ment of population residing in the region but everyone should enjoy the 10 Invasion of Azerbaijani Lands by Armenia and Heavy Consequences of Occupation right to self-determination.At the same time,the right and respect for self-determination of peoples can’t be used as a reason for violating the territorial integrity of an independent state,or a political unity,either fully or partially.Moreover,the equal rights of nations and the principle of self-determination must be granted by legitimate authorities in that territory without discrimination.Finally,the principle of self-determination does not grant the right to divide a territory of an existing state.In conformity with international documents,the realization of the right to self-determination requires adherence to other principles of international law—above all,the prin-ciple of the territorial integrity of a state.[8] [9] The foregoing indicates that the attempts of Armenia to define the armed clashes in Nagorno Karabakh and in surrounding districts,the dismemberment of Azerbaijani territories by force,and the use of ethnic cleansing against the Azerbaijanis as an attempt by local Armenians to have self-determination contradict key principles of international law.Many facts prove that Armenia is an aggressor and that 20 percent of the Azerbaijani territories have been occupied by the armed forces of that country.For instance,Human Rights Watch’s 1994 report «Seven Years of Conflict in Nagorno-Karabakh» indicates that facts prove that Armenia is a party to the conflict.Based on numerous observations and proofs in the report,the conclusion was that the presence of the Armenian armed forces in the Azerbaijan territory makes it a party to the conflict from a legal point of view,and this conflict is assessed as an international armed conflict with Armenia and Azerbaijan as parties to it.[10] 11 2 INTERNATIONAL RECOGNITION OF THE OCCUPATION OF AZERBAIJANI TERRITORIES BY ARMENIA Beyond any doubt,Armenia is responsible for aggression against Azer-baijan and for occupation of Azerbaijani lands.By violating interna-tional legal norms and the UN Charter,Armenia has not only unleashed a war of aggression against international security and not only bears responsibility under international law,it has also occupied 20 percent of the Azerbaijani territory.Very influential international organizations on the conflict over the Nagorno Karabakh,including international organi-zations such as the UN,the OSCE,the Council of Europe,the European Union,the Organization of Islamic Conference,and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO),have affirmed this.We will begin with four resolutions of the United Nations Security Council on the conflict over Nagorno Karabakh.UNITED NATIONS The Security Council,Recalling the statements of the President of the Security Coun-cil of 29 January 1993 and of 6 April 1993 concerning Nagorno Karabakh conflict,12 Invasion of Azerbaijani Lands by Armenia and Heavy Consequences of Occupation Taking note of the report of the Secretary General dated 14 April 1993,Expressing its serious concern at the deterioration of the re-lations between the Republic of Armenia and the Republic of Azerbaijan,Noting with alarm the escalation in armed hostilities and,in particular,the latest invasion of the Kalbajar District of the Re-public of Azerbaijan by local Armenian forces,Concerned that this situation endangers peace and security in the region,Expressing grave concern at the displacement of a large num-ber of civilians and the humanitarian emergency in the region,in particular in the Kalbajar District,Reaffirming the respect for sovereignty and territorial integ-rity of all states in the region,Reaffirming also the inviolability of international borders and the inadmissibility of the use of force for the acquisition of ter-ritory,Expressing its support for the peace process being pursued within the framework of the Organization on Security and Coop-eration in Europe and deeply concerned at the disruptive effect that the escalation in armed hostilities can have on that process,the UN Security Council demands the immediate cesation of all hostilities and hostile acts with a view to establishing a durable cease-fire,as well as immediate withdrawal of all occupying forces from the Kalbajar District and other recently occupied ar-eas of Azerbaijan.[11] This resolution of the UN Security Council is of great political and legal significance.First,it is the first council resolution on the Ar-menian aggression against Azerbaijan.Second,it is the first outline of the council’s approach toward the Armenian aggression against Azerbaijan.Thus,this resolution expresses serious concern at the deterioration of the relations between the Republic of Armenia and the Republic of Azerbaijan.Third,the nature of the conflict is evalu-ated,and the conflict is assessed as a situation that endangers peace 13 Elkhan Suleymanov/Vurgun Suleymanov and security in the region.Fourth,the resolution affirms a respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity of all states in the region,including the territorial integrity,sovereignty,and inviolability of the borders of the Republic of Azerbaijan.Fifth,it affirms that the use of force for the acquisition of territory is illegal Therefore,the UN Security Council determined the legal basis of inadmissibility of the use of force for the acquisition of territories of another state.This legal basis enabled the council to call for immedi-ate withdrawal of all occupying forces from all the occupied areas of Azerbaijan.UN Security Council Resolution 853 of 29 July 1993 confirmed the occupation of Agdam District of Azerbaijan and reaffirmed the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Azerbaijan.At the same time,reaffirming the inviolability of international borders and the inadmis-sibility of the use of force for the acquisition of territory,the council condemned the seizure of Agdam District and of all other recently occupied areas of the Azerbaijani Republic.It also demanded the immediate cessation of all hostilities and the immediate,complete,and unconditional withdrawal of occupying forces from the district of Agdam and all other recently occupied areas of the Azerbaijani Republic.Nine provisions of the Security Council resolution contained the phrase «Armenians of Azerbaijan’s Nagorno Karabakh region.» [12] First,this phrase openly confirmed that Nagorno Karabakh is a region of Azerbaijan.Second,the population that resides there are not «people of Nagorno Karabakh,» as claimed by the Armenians.Instead,the phrase confirms the existence of Armenians in Nagorno Karabakh,that is,the existence of the Armenian community (another segment of the population in this region is the Azerbaijani community,who were ousted from their native lands after the ethnic cleansing by the armed forces of the Armenian Republic and are now living as internally displaced persons across the country).Third,this resolution added the phrase «growing tension between them» in addition to the phrase «expressing its serious concern at the deterioration of relations between the Republic of Armenia and the Azerbaijani Republic,» stipulated by UN Security Council Resolution 822.This indicates that the council is 14 Invasion of Azerbaijani Lands by Armenia and Heavy Consequences of Occupation concluding gradually and clearly that the Nagorno Karabakh conflict is an interstate conflict.Fourth,although Resolution 822 expressed «grave concern at the displacement of a large number of civilians and the humanitarian emer-gency in the region,in particular in the Kalbajar District,» this expres-sion was further elaborated:the council expressed «once again its grave concern at the displacement of large numbers of civilians in the Azer-baijani Republic and at the serious humanitarian emergency in the re-gion.» Thus,the document indicates that mainly Azerbaijani civilians were subjected to «displacement»—actually to ethnic cleansing.Fifth,while Resolution 822 reaffirmed respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of all states in the region,Resolution 853 first reaffirmed the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Azerbaijani Republic and then of all other states in the region.Bearing in mind that the military operations were fully conducted in Azerbaijani terri-tory,we can conclude that the talk here is mainly about respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Azerbaijan,and the UN Security Council gives prominence to this aspect.UN Security Council Resolution 874,14 October 1993 Reaffirming the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Azerbaijani Republic and of all other states in the region,Reaffirming also the inviolability of international borders and the inadmissibility of the use of force for the acquisition of ter-ritory,Expressing once again its grave concern at the human suf-fering the conflict has caused and at the serious humanitarian emergency in the region and expressing in particular its grave concern at the displacement of large numbers of civilians in the Azerbaijani Republic,it called for the withdrawal of forces from the occupied territories of Azerbaijan.The preamble of this reso-lution also envisaged the notion of «the conflict in and around the Nagorno Karabakh region of the Azerbaijani Republic.» [13] This phrase is of great importance.The trouble is not only the con-flict in Nagorno Karabakh region,but also «the conflict in and around» 15 Elkhan Suleymanov/Vurgun Suleymanov it.Because Nagorno Karabakh does not share a common border with Armenia and is surrounded by other Azerbaijani lands,we can conclude that the resolution is not only about Nagorno Karabakh but also about the Armenian-Azerbaijani conflict—to be more exact,about Armenia’s aggression against Azerbaijan.This fact is hinted at in the resolution.UN Security Council Resolution 884,12 November 1993 Noting with alarm the occupation of the Zangilan District and the city of Horadiz in Azerbaijan; Reaffirming the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Azerbaijani Republic and of all other states in the region; Reaffirming also the inviolability of international borders and the inadmissibility of the use of force for the acquisition of territory; Expressing grave concern at the latest displacement of a large number of civilians and the humanitarian emergency in the Zangilan District and the city of Horadiz and on Azerbai-jan’s southern frontier; the UN SC condemns the occupation of the Zangilan District and the city of Horadiz,attacks on civilians and bombardments of the territory of the Azerbaijani Republic; demands the unilateral withdrawal of occupying forces from Zangilan District and the city of Horadiz,and the withdrawal of occupying forces from other recently occupied areas of the Azerbaijani Republic.The preamble of this resolution also contains the phrase «the conflict in and around the Nagorno Karabakh region of the Azerbaijani Repub-lic»; moreover,item two of the resolution contained the phrase «Arme-nians of the Nagorno Karabakh region of Azerbaijan.» [14] Thus,the analyses of these international and legal documents lead us to conclude that the UN Security Council unambiguously endorses that the Nagorno Karabakh region belongs to Azerbaijan,and its resolutions reaf-firm Azerbaijan’s sovereignty,territorial integrity,and internationally recog-nized territories.These resolutions emphasize the inadmissibility of the use of force for the acquisition of territory and resolutely condemn the occupa-tion of Azerbaijani territories by Armenian forces and attacks on civilians.16 Invasion of Azerbaijani Lands by Armenia and Heavy Consequences of Occupation Several UN resolutions also demand the immediate and unconditional withdrawal of the Armenian occupying forces from the occupied areas of Azerbaijan.Along with the UN Security Council,the UN General Assembly adopted some important resolutions and decisions on the Armenian-Azerbaijani conflict over Nagorno Karabakh.We must note that the notion of the «Nagorno Karabakh region of the Azerbaijani Republic» was also stipulated in its resolutions.Thus,item 16 of the 16 January 1998 A/RES/52/22 resolution,«Cooperation between the United Nations and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe»—adopted by the UN General Assembly,without reference to a Main Committee—envisages the notion of the «conflict around the Nagorno Karabakh region of the Azerbaijani Republic.» [15] The UN General Assembly resolutions of 9 February 2000 A/ RES/54/117 (Item 16)[16]; of 2 March 2001 A/RES/55/179 (Item 15)[17]; of 14 February 2002 A/RES/56/216 (Item 21)[18]; and of 6 Feb-ruary 2003 A/RES/57/298 (Item 26)contained similar notions.[19] At the 85th plenary session of the 48th General Assembly of the United Nations on 20 December 1993,a resolution titled «Emergency international assistance to refugees and displaced persons in Azerbai-jan» (document A/RES/48/114),was passed.[20] It concerned the Ar-menian-Azerbaijani conflict over Nagorno Karabakh and addressed the heavy consequences of the humanitarian situation brought about by the conflict.This was the first UN document to admit that,because of the Armenian-Azerbaijani Nagorno Karabakh conflict,the humanitarian situation in Azerbaijan sharply deteriorated and the number of refugees and displaced persons exceeded one million.The 7 September 2006 98th plenary session of the 61st UN General Assembly passed a resolution titled «The Situation in the Occupied Territories of Azerbaijan» (no.60/285).It addresses the situation that formed because of fires caused by Armenian occupiers in Karabakh and adjacent areas (document A/60/L.60/Rev.2).The phrase «occupied territories of Azerbaijan» was both in the title and in the text of this resolution.[21] The name of the resolution speaks volumes as it recognizes the fact of the occupation of Azerbaijani territories.The expression 17 Elkhan Suleymanov/Vurgun Suleymanov «the region of Nagorno Karabakh of the Azerbaijani Republic» was also used in the resolution called «The situation in the occupied territories of Azerbaijan» (document A/62/L.42),which was adopted on 14 March 2008 by the 62nd UN General Assembly.This resolution deserves special mention because it reaffirms continued respect and support for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Republic of Azerbaijan within its internationally recognized borders,and it demands the immediate,complete,and unconditional withdrawal of all Armenian forces from all the occupied territories of the Republic of Azerbaijan.It also reaffirms that no state can recognize the situation resulting from the occupation of the territories of the republic as lawful or render aid or assistance in maintaining that situation.[22] The resolution again affirmed continued respect and support for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the republic within its internationally recognized borders; and demanded the immediate,complete,and unconditional withdrawal of all Armenian forces from all the occupied territories of the republic.The document also recognizes the necessity of providing normal,secure,and equal conditions of life for the Armenian and Azerbaijani communities in Nagorno Karabakh.This will allow an effective democratic system of self-governance in the Republic of Azerbaijan.The document especially notes that that no state can recognize as lawful the situation resulting from the occupation of territories of the Republic of Azerbaijan or render aid or assistance in maintaining this situation.This is not a one-off resolution.Article 8 of the resolution asks the UN Secretary General to present a comprehensive report on its imple-mentation.In addition,article 9 envisages including the 63rd session of the General Assembly,«The Situation on the Occupied Territories of Azerbaijan,» on the agenda.Along with these resolutions at the initiative of GUAM countries and despite all moves and measures by Armenia and its patrons,the UN General Assembly decided to place on the agenda of its 61st session the topic «On protracted conflicts in GUAM space and their impact on in-ternational peace,security and development» on frozen conflicts in the Former Soviet Union (FSU).[23] Later the topic was put on the agenda of the 62nd session of the General Assembly,then on the 63rd and 64th,and again on the 65th.18 Invasion of Azerbaijani Lands by Armenia and Heavy Consequences of Occupation The following conclusions can be drawn from the aforementioned official documents of the UN Security Council and General Assembly:• Nagorno Karabakh is recognized as a region of Azerbaijan.UN documents unequivocally confirm that the Nagorno Karabakh region belongs to Azerbaijan.• The fact of the occupation of Azerbaijani territories is recognized.• Following the eviction of the Azerbaijani population because of ethnic cleansing,the people living in Nagorno Karabakh are recognized not as nonexistent «Nagorno Karabakh people,» but as «Armenians in Azerbaijan’s Nagorno Karabakh region.» • The sovereignty,territorial integrity,inviolability of interna-tional borders,and impermissibility of gaining territories using force are confirmed.• Immediate,complete,and unconditional withdrawal of the oc-cupying forces from all the occupied districts of Azerbaijan is demanded.• The inalienable right of the people evicted from the occupied territories of the Azerbaijani Republic to return to their homes is confirmed,and the requirement is made for creating the necessary conditions for this,including comprehensive rehabilitation of the areas damaged by the intrusion.• The necessity of ensuring normal,safe,and equal life for the Armenian and Azerbaijani communities in the Nagorno Kara-bakh region of the Azerbaijani Republic is noted.• It is especially noted that no state shall recognize as lawful the situation resulting from the occupation of the territories of the Republic of Azerbaijan or render aid or assistance in maintain-ing this situation.COUNCIL OF EUROPE The Council of Europe has passed several very important decisions and resolutions concerning the settlement of the Armenian-Azerbai-jani conflict over Nagorno Karabakh.Based on the 10 April 1997 report by special rapporteur Seitlinger,[24] the Parliamentary As-sembly of the Council of Europe passed Resolution 1119,«On Con-19 Elkhan Suleymanov/Vurgun Suleymanov flicts in Transcaucasia,» on 22 April 1997.Concerning the conflicts in Abkhazia and Nagorno Karabakh,the assembly noted,Even though these two conflicts are different in nature,the Assem-bly stresses that their political settlement must be negotiated by all parties involved,drawing in particular on the following principles,which are based upon the 1975 Helsinki Final Act and the 1990 Paris Charter:inviolability of borders; guaranteed security for all peoples in the areas concerned,particularly through multinational peacekeeping forces; extensive autonomy status for Abkhazia and Nagorno Karabakh to be negotiated by all the parties concerned; right of return of refugees and displaced persons and their reintegra-tion respecting human rights.[25] The Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe (PACE)special rapporteur David Atkinson’s report on 29 November 2004 (document 10364)noted that «an important part of Azerbaijan is still under occupation by the Armenian forces.» His report especially noted that «Azerbaijan’s borders were recognized internationally when it was recognized as an independent state in 1992.Azerbaijan’s territory included the Nagorno Karabakh region» (b.5,section 3).[26] Based on this report,PACE passed Resolution 1416 (2005),«The conflict over the Nagorno Karabakh region dealt with by the OSCE Minsk Conference.» In the resolution,the PACE assembly noted with regret that the conflict over Nagorno Karabakh remained unsolved; hundreds of thousands of people were still displaced and live in miserable conditions; considerable parts of the territory of Azerbaijan were still occupied by the Armenian forces; and separatist forces were still in control of the Nagorno Karabakh region—as they are today.The assembly expressed its concern that the military action and the widespread ethnic hostilities that preceded it led to large-scale ethnic expulsion and the creation of monoethnic areas,which resembles ethnic cleansing.The assembly reaffirmed that independence and secession of a regional territory from a state may be achieved only through a lawful and peaceful process based on the democratic support of the inhabitants of that territory and not in the wake of an armed conflict leading to 20 Invasion of Azerbaijani Lands by Armenia and Heavy Consequences of Occupation ethnic expulsion and the de facto annexation of that territory to another state.It reiterated that the occupation of the foreign territory by a member state constitutes a grave violation of that state’s obligations as a member of the Council of Europe and reaffirms the right of displaced persons from the area of the conflict to return to their homes safely and with dignity.The assembly also mentioned Resolutions 822 (1993),853 (1993),874 (1993),and 884 (1993)of the UN Security Council,urging the parties concerned to comply with them,in particular by refraining from armed hostilities and by withdrawing military forces from occupied territories.It also asked the PACE bureau to create an ad hoc committee comprising,among others,the heads of the Minsk Conference countries’ national delegations.[27] PACE’s Resolution 1416 is of crucial importance,because PACE showed in its decision that Armenia is a country occupying Azerbaijani territory.In effect,it accused Armenia of aggression against Azerbai-jan and thus rejected Armenia’s claim that the sides to the conflict are only Nagorno Karabakh separatists and Azerbaijan.The official docu-ments of the Council of Europe have repeatedly stated that the Arme-nian armed forces have occupied Azerbaijani territories.As part of this process,on 9 January 2006 at another meeting of the subcommittee on the Nagorno Karabakh issue in Strasbourg,the report by the late Lord Russell-Johnston again contained the facts of the occupation of Azerbaijani territories,the separatist nature of the Nagorno Karabakh regime,the expulsion of one million Azerbaijanis,and so on.However,because of the Armenian delegation’s nonconstructive stance,the sub-committee’s work based on PACE Resolution 1416 ended after Lord Russell-Johnston’s death.Although PACE decided in 2011 to resume the subcommittee’s work,Armenia refused to take part in its work and continues to boycott it.At its summer session in 2008,PACE again displayed its interest in Azerbaijan’s territorial integrity.On 6 June 2008,based on the report «The Functioning of Democratic Institutions in Azerbaijan,» [28] special rapporteurs Andres Herkel and Evgenia Jivkova prepared Resolution 1614 with the same title.It was passed on 24 July 2008.Article 25.1 of the resolution states that the assembly «considers that sustainable democratic development will be extremely difficult in Azerbaijan as long 21 Elkhan Suleymanov/Vurgun Suleymanov as the country’s territorial integrity has not been restored.» Article 25.2 of PACE Resolution 1614 says that the assembly «takes note of the United Nations General Assembly Resolution ‘On the situation in the occupied territories of Azerbaijan,’ adopted on 14 March 2008.» [29] As mentioned above,the 14 March 2008 resolution of the UN General Assembly expressed serious concern that the armed conflict in and around the Nagorno Karabakh region continues to endanger international peace and security,reaffirmed Azerbaijan’s territorial integrity,expressed support for its internationally recognized borders,and demanded the immediate withdrawal of Armenian forces from the occupied territories.[22] Thus,PACE confirmed its support for the UN General Assembly resolution «On the situation in the occupied territories of Azerbaijan,» adopted on 14 March 2008; confirmed that the Nagorno Karabakh region belongs to Azerbaijan; and demanded withdrawal of the Armenian armed forces from the occupied territories of Azerbaijan.ORGANIZATION OF THE ISLAMIC CONFERENCE The Organization of the Islamic Conference has always con-demned the Armenian aggression against Azerbaijan,described Ar-menia as an aggressor in its decision,called on UN sanctions against Armenia,and demanded immediate,unconditional,and complete withdrawal of the Armenian armed forces from all the occupied Azerbaijani territories.The Organization of the Islamic Conference (OIC,currently the Organization of Islamic Cooperation)is one of the most impor-tant international,interstate,regional organizations in the world and comprises the biggest Muslim governments.In fact,in terms of member states,OIC is the second interstate organization in the world after the United Nations.Currently OIC has fifty-seven mem-ber states from four continents—Asia,Europe,Africa,and South America,with a total population of 1.5 billion people.The special role of the OIC in the contemporary system of international relations is reflected in the agreement on cooperation between the OIC and the UN.The OIC has published numerous decisions and resolutions con-cerning the Armenian aggression against Azerbaijan,including those 22 Invasion of Azerbaijani Lands by Armenia and Heavy Consequences of Occupation made at meetings of heads of states and governments (summits)and foreign ministers.The OIC’s position concerning the Armenian aggression against Azerbaijan was revealed in a number of documents adopted by the top body of the OIC—the summits of the heads of states and governments of the member countries.These includey the final communique of the 7th Islamic Summit Conference (Session of Fraternity and Revival)in Casablanca,Kingdom of Morocco,13-15 December 1994 [30]; • the documents of the 8th Islamic Summit Conference (Session of Dignity,Dialogue,Participation)in Tehran,Islamic Re-public of Iran,9-11 December 1997 [31]; • the final communique of the 9th Islamic Summit Conference in Doha,State of Qatar,12-13 November 2000 [32]; • the final communique of the 10th Islamic Summit Conference (Session of Knowledge and Morality for the Progress of Um-mah)in Putrajaya,Malaysia,16-17 October 2003 (Article 33)[33]; • the final communique of the third Extraordinary Session of the Islamic Summit Conference,«Meeting the Challenges of the 21st Century,Solidarity in Action,» in Makkah Al Mukar-ramah (Mecca),7-8 December 2005 [34]; and • the final communique of the 11th Islamic Summit Conference (Session of Muslim Ummah in the 21st Century)in Dakar,Re-public of Senegal,13-14 March 2008 (article 61)[35].In addition,the 9th Islamic Summit Conference (Doha,State of Qatar)adopted Resolution 21/9-P (IS),«On Aggression of the Re-public of Armenia Against the Azerbaijani Republic»; Resolution 21/9-E (IS),«On Rendering Economic Assistance to the Azerbaijani Republic»; and Resolution 25/9-C,«On the Damage and Destruction of Islamic Historical and Cultural Monuments on the Occupied Ter-ritories of Azerbaijan as a Result of the Aggression of the Republic of Armenia Against the Azerbaijani Republic.» The 10th Islamic Summit Conference (Putrajaya,Malaysia)adopted Resolution 12/I0-P (IS),«On Aggression of the Republic of Armenia 23 Elkhan Suleymanov/Vurgun Suleymanov Against the Azerbaijani Republic»; Resolution 21/10-E (IS),«On Rendering Economic Assistance to the Azerbaijani Republic»; and Resolution (j),«On the Damage and Destruction of Islamic Historical and Cultural Monuments on the Occupied Territories of Azerbaijan as a Result of the Aggression of the Republic of Armenia Against the Azer-baijani Republic.» Among the resolutions on cultural and social issues,the 11th Islamic Summit Conference (Dakar,Republic of Senegal)adopted Resolution 10/11-P(IS),«On Aggression of the Republic of Armenia Against the Azerbaijani Republic»; the section «On Rendering Economic Assistance to the Azerbaijani Republic» in Resolution 2/11-E (İS); «On Activities Related to Rendering Economic Assistance to OIC Member States and Non-Member States and Muslim Communities»; and Resolution 2/11-C (İS),«On Protecting Holy Islamic Sites,» among the resolutions on cultural and social issues.In addition,provisions concerning the Armenian aggression against Azerbaijan have been reflected in various documents,including final communiques,declarations,and numerous resolutions adopted by the OIC Foreign Ministers Council.At the 11th Islamic Summit Conference in Dakar on 13-14 March 2008,the second and current charter of OIC was adopted.It consists of eighteen chapters and thirty-nine articles.Because of Azerbaijan’s efforts,point 4 of article 1 in chapter 1 confirmed that the member states unequivocally support the right of the countries under occupation to restore their territorial integrity.This will play a crucial role in strengthening the legal basis for the future direction of Azerbaijan’s foreign policy.In addition to the various documents adopted at the summits of the OIC member states,the organization’s position concerning the Arme-nian aggression against Azerbaijan was also reflected in many docu-ments adopted by the OIC Foreign Ministers Council,including final communiques,declarations,and numerous resolutions.They include • Article 15 of the final communique of the fifth extraordinary ses-sion of the OIC Foreign Ministers Council in Istanbul on 17-18 June 1992 24 Invasion of Azerbaijani Lands by Armenia and Heavy Consequences of Occupation • Articles 64,65,66,67,68,69,and 70 of the final communi-que’s section,«On the conflict

Azerbaijani Republic» of Resolu-tion 2/37,«On protecting holy Islamic sites,» of the 37th session of the OIC Foreign Ministers Council in Dushanbe,Tajikistan,on 18-20 May 2010.The OIC decisions and resolutions concerning the Armenian ag-gression against Azerbaijan can be classified as 1.resolutions «On the Conflict Between Armenia and Azer-baijan» and «On the Aggression of the Republic of Armenia Against the Azerbaijani Republic»; 2.resolutions «On Rendering Economic Assistance to the Azerbai-jani Republic»; and 3.resolutions «On the Damage and Destruction of Islamic Histori-cal and Cultural Monuments on the Occupied territories of Azer-baijan as a Result of the Aggression of the Republic of Armenia Against the Azerbaijani Republic.» From the content of the OIC decisions and resolutions concerning the Armenian aggression against Azerbaijan,the following conclusions can be drawn:First,OIC confirms that Armenia has occupied the Azerbaijani territories (for example,see article 8 of the final communique of the 7th summit of the OIC in Casablanca on 13-15 December 1994; article 61 of the final communique of the 9th summit of the OIC in Doha,Qatar,on 12-13 November 2000; article 33 of the final communique of the 10th summit of the OIC in Malaysia on 16-17 October 2003; article 61 of the final communique of the 11th summit of the OIC in Dakar,Senegal,on 13-14 March 2008; and others).Second,OIC strongly condemns Armenia’s aggression against the Azerbaijani Republic and demands an end to this aggression.In addition,28 Invasion of Azerbaijani Lands by Armenia and Heavy Consequences of Occupation it demands an immediate,complete,and unconditional with drawal of Armenian armed forces from the occupied Azerbaijani territories.Third,OIC recognizes Armenia as an aggressor and asks the UN Security Council to recognize the fact of aggression against Azerbaijan and to take appropriate steps to ensure compliance with the decisions made by the UN Security Council under chapter 7 of the UN Charter İKT.The violation of contemporary international legal norms and prin-ciples by Armenia makes this country liable under international law.In this case,it is legal for the UN Security Council to take international enforcement measures against Armenia in line with the UN Charter.Fourth,the OIC’s recognition of Armenia as the aggressor state means that the Republic of Armenia is a direct participant in the con-flict over Nagorno Karabakh.This fact was also reflected later in the 2 December 2008 Moscow Declaration.It is very important that this fact is reflected in international legal documents; it proves the groundless-ness of the Armenian concept of the conflict being between Azerbaijan and the Nagorno Karabakh,between the center and a region.Fifth,OIC deems the actions committed by the Armenian armed forces against the Azerbaijani population on the occupied territories to be a crime against humanity.This provides the legal grounds for bringing to responsibility high-ranking officials of Armenia who were involved in the crimes against the Azerbaijani population on Azerbai-jan’s territory,including the genocide committed against civilians in the town of Khojali.Sixth,OIC defines the main principles for peaceful and fair settle-ment of the conflict:territorial integrity and the inviolability of interna-tionally recognized borders.Seventh,OIC considers it necessary that Armenia stop illegal eco-nomic activities,exploitation of natural resources in Azerbaijan’s oc-cupied territories,and the practice of destroying cultural and historical monuments in Azerbaijan,including Islamic monuments.Eighth,OIC has decided that its member states take coordinated steps toward achieving the above objective.With its decisions,OIC notes the need to demonstrate solidarity with the Azerbaijani people within the framework of other international organizations as well.For instance,article 61 of the communique of OIC’s ninth summit notes 29 Elkhan Suleymanov/Vurgun Suleymanov that OIC agreed it needs to bolster its support for the UN General As-sembly draft resolution «On the situation on Azerbaijan’s occupied ter-ritories,» which was put forward at Azerbaijan’s initiative.Consequently,we can conclude that,with its decisions and resolu-tions,OIC gives a just legal assessment of the Armenian-Azerbaijani conflict over Nagorno Karabakh and defines the international legal framework for settling the conflict.ORGANIZATION FOR SECURITY AND COOPERATION IN EUROPE (OSCE)The Armenian aggression against Azerbaijan is one of the issues on which the OSCE has focused its attention.It has undertaken a mediation mission for resolving the conflict and has taken steps to make headway in this direction.In February 1992,the first OSCE mission visited Azer-baijan to prepare a report on the conflict,which was presented at the session of the Committee of Senior Officials (CSO)in Prague,Czech Republic,in February.The report reaffirmed Nagorno Karabakh as part of the territory of Azerbaijan.The CSO also declared that the conflict must be resolved through peaceful means.The OSCE Council of Foreign Ministers discussed the situation on 24 March 1992 and decided to call a peace conference on Nagorno Karabakh with guarantees from the CSO.On that day,the OSCE Minsk Group was formed to resolve the Nagorno Karabakh conflict peacefully through negotiations.The conference was to include participants from Armenia,Azerbaijan,Belarus,the Czech and Slovak Federal Republic,France,Germany,Italy,the Russian Federation,Sweden,Turkey,and the United States.In May 1992,the CSO made decisions regarding the organization of the conference and conditions for holding the session as well as the powers of the chairperson.The Minsk Group set up to or-ganize the Minsk Conference was to take part in settling the conflict.A final document on the settlement of the conflict was also to be adopted in Minsk.[36] The Council of Ministers expressed its deep concern about the continuing escalation of the armed conflict in and around Nagorno Karabakh that was increasing the sufferings and loss of life of the inhabitants.They held an extensive discussion of ways and means 30 Invasion of Azerbaijani Lands by Armenia and Heavy Consequences of Occupation to end the conflict,bearing in mind its implications for regional and international security.They called on all the parties to exercise restraint.The ministers also reiterated in strong terms a call for an immediate and effective cease-fire,including an active commitment of responsible local commanders to implement it.They issued an appeal for reestablishment of conditions for trust and constructive dialogue,including the cessation of economic and political constraints.The ministers reviewed the ongoing action within the OSCE frame-work and all decisions made by the Committee of Senior Officials.They expressed their appreciation for the activities of the OSCE chairman-in-office,undertaken and stressed their willingness to extend all possible assistance to him whenever needed.They welcomed the complementary efforts made by the European Community and its member states,by the member states of the Commonwealth of Independent States,by the mem-bers of the North Atlantic Co-operation Council,and in particular by the United Nations Secretary General.They requested that the chairman-in-office of the OSCE keep in close contact with the United Nations in this respect and to arrange for regular exchanges of information.The ministers agreed that the OSCE must play a major role in pro-moting a peace process relating to the conflict.They also agreed that the situation in and around Nagorno Karabakh requires further OSCE action.They mandated that the chairman-in-office,Mr.Jiri Dienstbier,visit the region shortly to contribute in the establishment and main-tenance of an effective cease-fire,as well as in the establishment of a framework for an overall peaceful settlement.They also expressed their firm conviction that a conference on Nagorno Karabakh under the auspices of the OSCE would provide an ongoing forum for negotiations toward a peaceful settlement of the crisis based on the principles,com-mitments,and provisions of the OSCE.The ministers therefore requested that the chairman-in-office con-vene such a conference as soon as possible.This conference,which will take place in Minsk,will have participants from Armenia,Azerbaijan,Belarus,the Czech and the Slovak Federal Republic,France,Germany,Italy,Russian Federation,Sweden,Turkey and the United States.The chairperson of the conference will invite elected and other representa-tives of Nagorno Karabakh as interested parties after consultation with 31 Elkhan Suleymanov/Vurgun Suleymanov the states participating in the conference.The chairperson-in-office will appoint the chairperson of the conference under the auspices of the OSCE.The ministers urged all OSCE participating states and all concerned parties to take necessary steps to ensure that humanitarian assistance is provided to all those in need through rapid and effective means,including safe corridors under international control.The ministers noted the commitment of Armenia and Azerbaijan to support the mission of the chairperson-in-office to the region as well as other actions on which the council agreed,and they appealed to these two countries to pursue actively this commitment to reach a lasting,peaceful solution.[36] Another summit of OSCE member states was held in Budapest in 1994.The participants also discussed the Armenian-Azerbaijani con-flict over Nagorno Karabakh and decided to include the documents adopted on this issue in an appropriate section.The Regional Issues section included «Intensification of OSCE action in relation to the Na-gorno Karabakh conflict,» which talked about the Nagorno Karabakh conflict.This section welcomed the cease-fire between the sides and tasked the then-chairman-in-office to name the co-chairs of the Minsk Conference.The document said,Deploring the continuation of the conflict and the human tragedy involved,the participating States welcomed the confirmation by the parties to the conflict of the cease-fire agreed on 12 May 1994 through the mediation of the Russian Federation in co-operation with the OSCE Minsk Group.They confirmed their commitment to the relevant resolutions of the United Nations Security Council and welcomed the political support given by the Security Council to the OSCE’s efforts towards a peaceful settlement of the conflict.To this end,they called on the parties to the conflict to enter into intensified substantive talks,including direct contacts.In this context,they pledged to redouble the efforts and assistance by the OSCE.They strongly endorsed the mediation efforts of the OSCE Minsk Group and expressed appreciation for the crucial contribution of the Russian Federation and the efforts by other individual members of the Minsk Group.They agreed to harmonize these into a single coordinated effort within the framework of the OSCE.To this end,they have directed the chairman-in-office,in 32 Invasion of Azerbaijani Lands by Armenia and Heavy Consequences of Occupation consultation with the participating States and acting as soon as possible,to name co-chairmen of the Minsk Conference to ensure a common and agreed basis for negotiations and to realize full co-ordination in all mediation and negotiation activities.The co-chairmen,guided in all of their negotiating efforts by OSCE principles and an agreed mandate,will jointly chair meetings of the Minsk Group and jointly report to the chairman-in-office.They will regularly brief the Permanent Council on the progress of their work.As a first step in this effort,they directed the co-chairmen of the Minsk Conference to take immediate steps to promote,with the support and co-operation of the Russian Federation and other individual members of the Minsk Group,the continuation of the existing cease-fire and,drawing upon the progress already achieved in previous mediation activities,to conduct speedy negotiations for the conclusion of a political agreement on the cessation of the armed conflict,the implementation of which will eliminate major consequences of the conflict for all parties and permit the convening of the Minsk Conference.They further requested the co-chairmen of the Minsk Conference to continue working with the parties towards further implementation of confidence-building measures,particularly in the humanitarian field.They underlined the need for participating States to take action,both individually and within relevant international organizations,to provide humanitarian assistance to the people of the region with a special emphasis on alleviating the plight of refugees.[37] The document also stated that,in line with the view of the parties to the conflict,the conclusion of the agreement would make it possible to deploy multinational peacekeeping forces as an essential element for the implementation of the agreement itself.They declared their politi-cal will to provide,with an appropriate resolution from the United Na-tions Security Council,a multinational OSCE peacekeeping force for the cessation of the armed conflict.They requested that the chairman-in-office quickly develop a plan for the establishment,composition,and operations of such a force,organized based on chapter 3 of the Hel-sinki Document 1992 and in a manner consistent with the charter of the United Nations.To this end,the chairperson-in-office will be assisted by the co-chair persons of the Minsk Conference and by the Minsk Group and be sup-33 Elkhan Suleymanov/Vurgun Suleymanov ported by the Secretary General.After appropriate consultations,he or she will also establish a high-level planning group in Vienna to make recommendations on,among other things,the size and characteristics of the force,command and control,logistics,allocation of units and resources,rules of engagement,and arrangements with contributing states.He or she will also seek the support of the United Nations based on its stated readiness to provide technical advice and expertise as well as continuing political support from the United Nations Security Coun-cil for the possible deployment of an OSCE peacekeeping force.Based on such preparatory work and the relevant provisions of chapter 3 of the Helsinki Document 1992,and after agreement and a formal request by the parties to the chairperson-in-office through the co-chairperson of the Minsk Conference,the Permanent Council will make a decision on the establishment of the OSCE peacekeeping operation.[37] The OSCE summit advised the Minsk Conference to continue the current cease-fire with the help of the Minsk Group and to step up ef-forts for taking suitable measures toward signing a peace treaty.It also envisaged sending a multinational peacekeeping force to the conflict zone after the treaty is signed.One of the main results of the Budapest Summit was the establish-ment of the institution of Minsk Group co-chairs.The decision to form a peacekeeper mission from military forces of different countries cur-tailed Russia’s desire to solve the issue unilaterally.Another summit of OSCE member states was held in Lisbon in 1996.The main parameters for the settlement of the Armenian-Azerbaijani conflict over Nagorno Karabakh were reflected in the statement of the chairman-in-office of the OSCE.The statement said,No progress has been achieved in the last two years to resolve the Nagorno Karabakh conflict and the issue of the territorial integrity of the Republic of Azerbaijan.I regret that the efforts of the Co-Chairmen of the Minsk Conference to reconcile the views of the parties on the principles for a settlement have been unsuccessful.Three principles that should form part of the settlement of the Nagorno Karabakh conflict were recommended by the co-chairmen of the Minsk Group.These prin-ciples are supported by all member States of the Minsk Group.They are:Territorial integrity of the Republic of Armenia and the Republic of 34 Invasion of Azerbaijani Lands by Armenia and Heavy Consequences of Occupation Azerbaijan; • Legal status of Nagorno Karabakh defined in an agreement based on self-determination which confers on Nagorno Karabakh the highest degree of self-rule within Azerbaijan; • Guaranteed security for Nagorno Karabakh and its whole popu-lation,including mutual obligations to ensure compliance by all the Parties with the provisions of the settlement.I regret that one participating State could not accept this.These principles have the support of all other participating States.[38] Therefore,as an international organization,OSCE confirmed that the conflict can be settled only on the conditions of Azerbaijan’s territorial integrity,keeping Nagorno Karabakh part of Azerbaijan,and ensuring the safety of the Nagorno Karabakh population (both the Armenian and Azerbaijani communities).This was the first time Armenia had incurred serious resentment from the international community and found itself isolated.With this decision,OSCE made its position on the conflict over Nagorno Karabakh clear.The OSCE Istanbul summit was held on 19 November 1999.Articles 20 and 21 of the summit’s declaration were completely devoted to the Armenian-Azerbaijani conflict over Nagorno Karabakh.The declara-tion said,We received the report of the Co-Chairmen of the OSCE Minsk Group on the evolving situation and recent developments connected with the Nagorno Karabakh conflict and commend their efforts.We applaud in particular the intensified dialogue between the Presidents of Armenia and Azerbaijan,whose regular contacts have created opportunities to reinvigorate the process of finding a lasting and comprehensive solution to the problem.We firmly support this dialogue and encourage its continuation,with the hope of resuming negotiations within the OSCE Minsk Group.We also confirm that the OSCE and its Minsk Group,which remains the most appropri-35 Elkhan Suleymanov/Vurgun Suleymanov ate format for finding a solution,stand ready to further advance the peace process and its future implementation,including by providing all necessary assistance to the parties.[39] The Astana summit of the OSCE,which took place on 2-3 December 2010,adopted a declaration,«Towards a Security Community.» During the summit,OSCE Minsk Group co-chair countries’ heads of delega-tions and the presidents of Azerbaijan and Armenia made the following joint declaration:On the occasion of the OSCE Summit in Astana,Kazakhstan,the Heads of Delegation of the OSCE Minsk Group Co-Chair countries (President of the Russian Federation Dmitri Medvedev,Prime Minister of France Francois Fillon,and Secretary of State of the United States Hillary Rodham Clinton),President of Azerbaijan Ilham Aliyev,and President of Armenia Serzh Sargsyan agreed that the time has come for more decisive efforts to resolve the Nagorno Karabakh conflict.In this context,they recalled the joint statements of the Presidents of Azerbaijan and Armenia,with the President of the Russian Federation,on November 2,2008,in Moscow,and on October 27,2010,in Astrakhan.They further agreed that a peaceful,negotiated settlement will bring stability and security and that it is the only way to bring real reconciliation to the peoples of the region.[40] The Presidents of Armenia and Azerbaijan reaffirmed their commitment to seek a final settlement of the Nagorno Karabakh conflict,based upon:the principles and norms of international law; the United Nations Charter; the Helsinki Final Act; as well as the state-ments of Presidents Medvedev,Sarkozy,and Obama,at L’Aquila on July 10,2009 [see reference 4],and at Muskoka on June 26,2010 [see reference 5].The three OSCE co-chair countries pledged their support for the Presidents of Azerbaijan and Armenia as they make the necessary decisions to reach a peaceful settlement.They urged the leaders of Armenia and Azerbaijan to focus with renewed energy on the issues that still remain in the Basic Principles,and instructed their 36 Invasion of Azerbaijani Lands by Armenia and Heavy Consequences of Occupation Co-Chairs to continue to work with the parties to the conflict to assist in these efforts.In order to create a better atmosphere for the negotia-tions,they called for additional steps to strengthen the cease-fire and carry out confidence-building measures in all fields.As can be seen from the objective of the document,it is largely general in nature.The OSCE deals with settlements of conflicts and has made in-tense efforts on the path toward obtaining real results,so its activi-ties must be valued highly.Although the OSCE’s efforts have so far not yielded a real peace,those efforts play a major role in keeping the conflict over Nagorno Karabakh in the attention of the interna-tional community.In addition,as opposed to other international or-ganizations and with the consent of both sides,the OSCE is directly tackling the settlement of the Nagorno Karabakh conflict.Perhaps the OSCE is trying to adopt a «neutral» position in the conflict for this reason.However,the lack of differentiation between the aggres-sor and the victim of aggression prolongs the conflict rather than resolving it.The following conclusions can be drawn from documents of the OSCE and especially from documents adopted at OSCE summits:• Nagorno Karabakh is the territory of the Azerbaijani Republic; this fact is admitted and confirmed.• The territorial integrity of the Azerbaijani Republic is supported.• Nagorno Karabakh’s legal status has to be self-determined exclu-sively as a highly autonomous part of Azerbaijan.• The security of Nagorno Karabakh and all its people must be en-sured,including mutual commitments by all sides to comply with the provisions of the settlement.EUROPEAN UNION This economic and political bloc of twenty-seven European coun-tries is one of the biggest organizations influencing the geopolitical situation today.The 1993 Maastricht Treaty,which aimed at regional integration,turned the European Community into the European Union.37 Elkhan Suleymanov/Vurgun Suleymanov (We will call it the European Union throughout.)Because the South Caucasus is close to the borders of the European Union,the events unfolding there are bound to concern the European Union.As an actor in international law,the European Union has openly stated its position regarding the Armenian-Azerbaijani conflict over Na-gorno Karabakh.The European Union made its first declaration on this conflict on 22 May 1992.It expressed its serious concern over the escalation of the clashes in the Nagorno Karabakh region and recalled that,since both the Armenian and the Azerbaijani governments had committed them-selves to OSCE principles and obligations,all their peoples are entitled to the same level of protection,and their fundamental rights have to be completely restored within the framework of the internationally recog-nized borders.The European Union called on the sides to exercise pa-tience,to make a constructive contribution to the OSCE process,and to work toward swiftly holding the OSCE Peace Conference on Nagorno Karabakh.The European Union adopted another declaration concerning the Nagorno Karabakh conflict on 18 June 1992.In it,the organization re-stated its concern over the continuing military operations and called again on Armenia and Azerbaijan to respect human rights in line with the commitments of the OSCE member states and to create the condi-tions necessary for the swift organization of the Minsk conference as the best hope for restoring peace in the region.The European Union made another declaration on 7 April 1993.It expressed concern over the deepening of the conflict,regretted that «military operations spilled over to Kalbajar and Fuzuly districts,» and called on «Armenia to use its influence on the Nagorno Karabakh armed formations for the withdrawal from the territories of Azerbaijan and stopping the hostilities on them.» New operations conducted by the occupational forces of Armenia in the frontline zone forced the organization to pass new resolutions on 24 June and 3 September 1993.It condemned Armenia’s military attacks against Azerbaijan and expressed concern over the increase in the number of refugees.The European Union said it supported the efforts of the OSCE Minsk Group to establish peace in the region and 38 Invasion of Azerbaijani Lands by Armenia and Heavy Consequences of Occupation called on the sides to create good conditions for implementing the pro-cess.The organization demanded that both sides respect UN resolutions and noted the need to withdraw armed forces from Kalbajar,Agdam,Fuzuly,and Jabrail Districts.The resolution also contained a demand that Armenia not render assistance to local Armenian forces that attack Azerbaijani territories.On 9 November 1993,the European Union passed another resolution on the Nagorno Karabakh conflict.It expressed concern over the escalation of the military operations and said that the increased number of refugees would heighten the tension in the region.The declaration confirmed that,in line with OSCE principles,the European Union attached great importance to Azerbaijan’s territorial integrity and sovereignty.The resolution said the EU was especially concerned about tens of thousands of civilians who have to flee to avoid military clashes and said that refugees increase the risk of making the problem international and threaten to destabilize the entire region.Several communiques were issued on behalf of the chairperson of the European Union in 1994,in which the organization again stated support for Azerbaijan’s territorial integrity and called on the sides to resolve the conflict peacefully and to comply with relevant resolutions of the UN Security Council.Therefore,in its declarations on the Nagorno Karabakh conflict,the European Union has a cautious stance,does not differentiate between the aggressor and the victim of aggression,and claims that Nagorno Karabakh Armenians carried out the military offensive.These docu-ments also do not contain a specific position on the occupation of the territories of Azerbaijan by Armenia and do not speak about the true causes of the conflict.One of the main events when the European Union stated its position on the Armenian-Azerbaijani conflict over Nagorno Karabakh occurred in 2003.The EU suggested that,in return for opening communications,five of the occupied Azerbaijani districts be returned.The proposal was discussed at length and is still topical,which shows that the European Union is serious about developing ties with the region and playing an active part in settling the conflict.At the same time,the official position of the European Union on a 39 Elkhan Suleymanov/Vurgun Suleymanov peaceful settlement of the conflict was reflected in the resolution of the European Parliament of 20 May 2010 on the need for an EU strategy for the South Caucasus.[41] In the resolution,the EU noted its respect for the principles of sovereignty and territorial integrity in its relations with the Southern Caucasian states,yet article 2 emphasizes that retaining the status quo in the conflicts in the region is unacceptable and unsustain-able,since it bears the constant risk of an escalation of tensions and the resumption of armed hostilities.Article 5 states that it is unacceptable for external actors to introduce conditions for the respect of the sover-eignty and territorial integrity of the South Caucasus states.Thus,in its resolution,the European Parliament unequivocally supported within its internationally recognized borders the state sovereignty and territorial integrity of the South Caucasus countries,including the Republic of Azerbaijan,and deemed conditions that may damage this unacceptable.Articles 6-11 of the resolution are about the peaceful settlement of the Nagorno Karabakh conflict.Articles 6-7 welcome continued negotiations between the presidents of Azerbaijan and Armenia,the signature of the bilateral Moscow declaration,efforts by the OSCE Minsk Group,and the declaration by the president of co-chairing countries at the July 2009 G8 summit.In article 8,the European Union said it is seriously concerned that hundreds of thousands of refugees and internally displaced people who fled their homes during or in connection with the Nagorno Karabakh war remained displaced and had been denied rights,including the right to return,the right to personal security,and property rights.The European Union calls on all the parties to recognize these rights unambiguously and unconditionally,realize them promptly,and imple-ment a prompt solution to this problem that respects the principles of international law; it also demands the withdrawal of Armenian forces from all the occupied territories of Azerbaijan.Article 10 of the resolu-tion again states the important position according to which Nagorno Karabakh,including all the occupied Azerbaijani lands around Nago-rno Karabakh,should rapidly be abandoned.It also notes that an inter-im status for Nagorno Karabakh could be a solution until the final status is determined and could create a transitional framework for peaceful 40 Invasion of Azerbaijani Lands by Armenia and Heavy Consequences of Occupation coexistence and cooperation between the Armenian and the Azerbaijani populations in the region.This resolution made the European Parliament’s position regarding regional issues very clear,including those on the settlement of the Na-gorno Karabakh conflict.Undoubtedly,the articles influence other top bodies of the European Union as well as the leaders of the EU member countries to form a policy for authoritative organization on the Nagorno Karabakh problem.It must be noted that the chairman of the European Commission,Jose Manuel Barrozo—at the joint press conference after his meeting with the president of the Azerbaijani Republic,Ilham Aliyev,and at his speech at Baku State University during the visit to Baku in January of 2011—spoke about the conflict over Nagorno Karabakh and noted that it posed an obstacle to peace and stability in the region.He also said that the European Union unconditionally supports the territorial integrity of Azerbaijan and wants the restoration of its territorial integrity.NORTH ATLANTIC TREATY ORGANIZATION (NATO)A fair and appropriate assessment of the Armenian-Azerbaijani conflict over Nagorno Karabakh can be found in the documents of the NATO political and military bloc.NATO has adopted a number of deci-sions and resolutions concerning the conflict.The 2006 Riga Summit of NATO members expressed its view on the conflicts in post-Soviet countries in the 43rd point of the final communique.The document sup-ports the territorial integrity and sovereignty of Azerbaijan,Armenia,Georgia,and Moldova.[42] This is crucial.The US Deputy Secretary of State for Europe and Eurasia,Daniel Fried,said,«This is the first declaration by NATO on this issue and this is an important signal for the countries in the region.» The summit of the heads of states participating in the North Atlantic Council in Bucharest in April 2008 reflected NATO’s position.Article 43 of the 3 April 2008 Bucharest Summit Declaration says,«We are concerned with the persistence of regional conflicts in the South Cauca-sus and the Republic of Moldova.Our nations support the territorial in-tegrity,independence and sovereignty of Armenia,Azerbaijan,Georgia and the Republic of Moldova.We will continue to support the efforts 41 Elkhan Suleymanov/Vurgun Suleymanov towards a peaceful settlement of these regional conflicts,taking into ac-count these principles.» [43] Compared to the Riga document,the Bucharest decision contains an important addendum.It defines the principles for resolving the regional conflicts in the South Caucasus and Moldova,including the territorial in-tegrity,independence,and sovereignty of Azerbaijan and Armenia.With regard to that conflict,we should consider that Azerbaijan officially lays no claims to Armenian territory.On the contrary,it has occupied Azerbai-jani territories,violating territorial integrity.Therefore,the true meaning of article 43 of the NATO Bucharest Summit Declaration is support for the territorial integrity of Azerbaijan and resolution of the conflict over Nagorno Karabakh solely within the territorial integrity of Azerbaijan.NATO confirmed the same position in article 35 of the final communique adopted at the meeting of the North Atlantic Council foreign ministers held at NATO headquarters,Brussels,on December 3,2008 [44],and in article 58 of the Strasbourg / Kehl Summit Declaration,issued by the heads of states and governments participating in the meeting of the North Atlantic Council on 4 April 2009.The resolution states that NATO continues to support the territorial integrity,independence,and sovereignty of the South Caucasian countries,and Moldova and will continue to back measures aimed at peaceful resolution of these regional conflicts.[45] A summit of the heads of NATO member states took place in Lisbon on 19-20 November 2010,where Azerbaijan’s territorial integrity was once again supported.Article 35 of the Lisbon Summit Declaration sup-ports the territorial integrity,independence,and sovereignty of Arme-nia,Azerbaijan,Georgia,and Moldova,and backs the measures aimed at peaceful solutions for regional conflicts based on these principles.[46] The former special representative of the NATO Secretary General for the South Caucasus and Central Asian countries,Robert Simmons,noted that NATO is interested in the settlement of regional conflicts and supports political negotiations to this end.He said that NATO’s Lisbon Summit supported solving the conflicts in the South Caucasus within the framework of their territorial integrity.[47] It’s very interesting that NATO’s decision supports Azerbaijan’s ter-ritorial integrity unconditionally and does not mention the principle of 42 Invasion of Azerbaijani Lands by Armenia and Heavy Consequences of Occupation self-determination among the principles applicable to settling the con-flict over Nagorno Karabakh.It sees the solution to the Armenian-Azer-baijani conflict based on the principles of territorial integrity,indepen-dence,and sovereignty,and supports the measures aimed at peaceful settlement of regional conflicts based these principles.Documents adopted by NATO are another proof that this international,military-political organization recognizes the territorial integrity of Azerbaijan and supports the resolution of the conflict within the framework of the territorial integrity of Azerbaijan.Then-NATO Secretary General Jaap de Hoop Scheffer has confirmed this position.At a press conference after his meeting with the Azerbaijani president on 29 April 2009,he said the twenty-eight NATO member countries believe that the solution to the Nagorno Karabakh problem «must be found on the basis of compliance with the principles of sovereignty and territorial integrity.» [48] He also said that,«although NATO does not directly participate in the solution of the conflict over Nagorno Karabakh,it believes that in its settlement the principle of territorial integrity should not be cast in doubt.» [49] The following conclusion can be drawn:the decisions made by NATO give a just,international,legal assessment of the Armenian-Azerbaijani conflict and define principles that form the international legal basis for settling the conflict:territorial integrity,independence,and sovereignty.Therefore,the territorial integrity of Azerbaijan is recognized and supported by the most authoritative interstate and international organi-zations.This means that,in accordance with the current international law,Armenia’s occupation of Azerbaijani territories is blatant proof of its aggression against Azerbaijan.An aggression of one country against another is the gravest crime in international law and makes the aggres-sor country bear international legal liability.43 3 BIRTH OF A HUMANITARIAN EMERGENCY IN THE WAKE OF THE OCCUPATION OF AZERBAIJANI TERRITORIES BY ARMENIA A fifth of the territories of Azerbaijan,including the former Nagorno Karabakh Autonomous Region (NKAR)and seven adjacent districts (Lachin,Kalbajar,Agdam,Fuzuly,Jabrail,Gubadli,and Zangilan),were occupied in the wake of the military aggression by Armenian armed forces against Azerbaijan in 1988-1994.In addition,a number of residential areas in districts of Azerbaijan bordering Armenia and the seven districts bordering the occupied territories were occupied.Generally,the total area of the Azerbaijani districts that were not part of the NKAR but were occupied after the armed aggression of Arme-nia is four times as big as the Nagorno Karabakh region.The norms expressed in numerous international covenants on human rights were seriously violated,including all the pro-visions of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights; the In-ternational Covenant on Civil and Political Rights; the Inter-national Covenant on Economic,Social and Cultural Rights; the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination; the Convention Against Torture and 44 Invasion of Azerbaijani Lands by Armenia and Heavy Consequences of Occupation Other Cruel,Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment; and the Convention on the Rights of the Child.Moreover,during this armed ag-gression,the norms of international humanitarian law were also violated,including the provisions of the Hague Convention of 18 October 1907 on the Laws and Customs of War on Land (IV Convention); the Gene-va Convention of 12 August 1949 on the Protection of Civilian Persons in the Times of War; the Geneva Convention of 12 August 1949 on the Treatment of Prisoners of War (POWs); the Additional Protocol (1977)to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949 on the Protection of Victims of International Armed Conflicts; and UN Resolution 3318 (29),dated 14 December 1974,“On the Protection of Women and Children in Armed Conflicts.” The armed aggression of Armenia against Azerbaijan was accompa-nied with gross violation of human rights,and its criminal acts against local Azerbaijani populations fall into the category of crimes against humanity.During the Armenian-Azerbaijani conflict over Nagorno Karabakh,the Armenian armed forces killed more than twenty thou-sand people,over fifty thousand were wounded and crippled,thousands of people went missing,and civilians were lynched,killed in masses,taken hostage,and forced to work.Prisoners of war and hostages were subjected to torture and other inhumane treatment,while the wounded and the ill could not get first aid.Now most of the POWs and hostages are kept in secrecy from the International Red Cross in the Republic of Armenia and the occupied territories.One of the most terrible crimes against the Azerbaijani people was committed in the town of Khojali.The Khojali tragedy is a bloody event in the history of humanity comparable to the Khatyn and Lidice geno-cides.On the night of 25 February 1992,Armenian armed forces and armed gangs in Nagorno Karabakh seized the town of Khojali,which is between the towns of Khankandi and Asgaran,and committed acts of genocide against the Azerbaijani people.Crimes in the town of Kho-jali were committed with the direct involvement of the personnel and machinery of the 366th motor-rifle regiment of the former USSR.The second battalion of the 366th regiment,under the command of Maj.Sey-ran Mushegovich Ohanyan (now the Armenian defense minister); the third battalion under the command of Yevgeniy Nabokikhin; the first 45 Elkhan Suleymanov/Vurgun Suleymanov battalion,under Chief of Staff Valeriy Isayevich Chitchyan; and more than fifty Armenian officers from the regiment were among those who committed the crimes.Before the Armenian forces stormed Khojali,they opened fire with artillery guns and other military hardware on the evening of 25 February.This caused fires,and the town was ablaze at 5:00 a.m.on 26 February.Under these circumstances,about 2,500 civilians hoped to leave the town and reach the center of the Azerbaijani-populated Agdam District.But they couldn’t.As they attempted to flee,they were caught in ambushes set by Armenian armed men and brutally massacred.When Khojali was occupied,613 civilians—including 63 children,106 women,and 70 elderly people—were killed with cruelty and torture:they were beheaded,their eyes were blinded,and the wombs of pregnant women were pierced with bayonet.In this bloody massacre,1,275 civil-ians were taken captive,150 went missing,and 487—including 76 young children—were crippled.All the members of eight families were killed,25 children lost both parents,130 children lost one of their parents,and 56 civilians were tortured to death.The town of Khojali was razed to the ground.Part of the population was caught in ambushes and killed when they attempted to flee the violence.According to the Russian-based human rights watchdog Memorial,200 dead bodies of Azerbaijanis were taken from Khojali to Agdam within four days,and tens of these bodies were found desecrated.A total of 181 (130 male and 51 female,including children)corpses underwent judiciary medical examination in Agdam.It found that 151 died from bullet wounds,20 died from shrapnel wounds,and 10 were killed with blunt instruments.Memorial also noted a case in which the skin of a skull had been stripped off.Memorial reported,Those who were fleeing were caught in the Armenian ambushes and shot down.In any case some of them could reach Agdam,while the others,mainly women and children (their number cannot be veri-fied)lost their way in the mountains and were frozen to death.part of the captives were shot down.200 dead bodies were brought to Agdam within four days.Signs of violence could be seen in tens 46 Invasion of Azerbaijani Lands by Armenia and Heavy Consequences of Occupation of such dead bodies.Doctors in a sanitary train of Agdam District counted four corpses with their skulls skinned off.One dead body was beheaded.It was identified in the sanitary train that the skull of a living man was skinned off.[50] It should be noted that Serzh Sarkisyan,who became the Armenian president in 2008,was one of the organizers of this attack against the civilian population.British journalist Tomas de Waal wrote,“When an Armenian military commander asked Serzh Sarkisyan to speak about the seizure of Khojali,he answered cautiously:we prefer not to speak loudly about it.” He went on to say that Sarkisyan spoke about what happened more accurately and strictly:“I think that what really matters is different.Before Khojali the Azerbaijanis thought that they could have a joke with us and the Armenians were incapable of touching civilians.We managed to break this stereotype.” [51] Acts against humanity continued in the occupied territories of Azer-baijan well beyond the former Nagorno Karabakh Autonomous Region; the human rights of hundreds of thousands of civilians in the districts of Lachin,Kalbajar,Agdam,Fuzuly,Jabrail,Zangilan,and were brutally violated in a predetermined way,and they became internally displaced persons (IDPs).Thousands of people were taken captive or went missing when the Nagorno Karabakh region and adjacent territories came under occu-pation.Captives and POWs are under the protection of international humanitarian law,which prohibits repressive violence against them and requires the safety of hostages and captives.According to the State Commission of the Republic of Azerbaijan on Captives,Hostages and Missing Persons,among the civilians and POWs were cases of expo-sure to inhumane treatment,different types of violence,physical and psychological torture,killing,and medical experiments.Hostages and POWs died from either torture or intolerable conditions.Those who were freed have lifelong disabilities.The commission also reported that,as of 1 January 2011,the number of hostages,POWs,and missing persons was 4,049,including 3,273 military people and 771 civilians.Five persons could not be verified either as military or civilian.Among the civilians,47 were underage 47 Elkhan Suleymanov/Vurgun Suleymanov children (including 17 underage girls),247 were women,and 347 were elderly (including 149 women).A total of 1,399 people have been freed from captivity up to now,including 343 women and 1,056 men.At the same time,170 of them are children (including 85 underage girls)and 289 are elderly (including 112 elderly women).Based on incoming in-formation,the commission established that 553 people,including 104 women and 448 men,were killed or died due to various reasons while captive.Of these,137 are known by names,while 74 remain unidenti-fied.[52] Besides the aforementioned,Armenia pursued a policy of ethnic cleansing against the Azerbaijanis in the occupied territories and turned them into a monoethnic zone.Ethnic Azerbaijanis were expelled from the occupied territories and became IDPs.After the former NKAR was occupied,its ethnic Azerbaijani population was forced to flee.The same developments then occurred in the other seven districts of Azerbaijan.Thus,after Armenian occupation,71,000 Azerbaijani citizens in Lachin District,74,000 in Kalbajar District,165,600 in Agdam District,146,000 in Fuzuly District,66,000 in Jabrail District,37,900 in Gubadli District,and 39,500 in Zangilan District became IDPs.In all,more than 660,000 civilians living in the occupied territories of Azerbaijan (the NKAR and the seven districts)became IDPs.In addition,more than 100,000 Azerbaijani nationals fled the areas bordering Armenia and the occupation zone to other parts of the coun-try.In addition,as mentioned above,more than 250,000 ethnic Azer-baijanis were deported from the territory of the current Republic of Ar-menia in late 1988 and early 1989 and settled in Azerbaijan as refugees.Thus,thousands of people were killed or wounded,taken captive or went missing; civilians were subjected to severe psychological stress; and more than a million ethnic Azerbaijanis were forced out of their motherland and their homes and became refugees and IDPs because of the deportation of the ethnic Azerbaijanis from Armenia,the occupation of a fifth of Azerbaijan’s territories,and ethnic cleansing in the occupied territories.These people have temporary accommodation in more than 1,600 settlements in sixty-two towns and districts all over Azerbaijan.Moreover,health deteriorated and infant mortality rose among the populations from the districts occupied by Armenia due to bad living 48 Invasion of Azerbaijani Lands by Armenia and Heavy Consequences of Occupation conditions.The birth rate fell drastically,and the longevity rate sud-denly dropped in all the occupied districts in 1989-1998 to between 11.2 and 22.6 per one thousand people in all the districts.In the territories populated by the residents of Jabrail,Gubadli,Zangilan,and Agdam in the mentioned years was between 16.9 and 22.6.De-mographic indicators in all the occupied districts were below the nationwide average.The main reasons for the decrease were the dif-ficult living conditions in the mountains and foothills,the Armenian use of military aggression and inhumane treatment against civilians,and the shock and psychologically stressed of torture and ethnic cleansing.One of the most painful problems for refugees and IDPs is their lack of employment.According to the State Committee on Refugees and IDPs of the Republic of Azerbaijan,there were 301,359 able-bodied refugees and IDPs as of 1999,and 196,380 of them,or 65.2 percent,were unemployed.As of 1999,74,000 IDPs were settled in tent towns with poor conditions; 99,000 in settlements with fixed houses; 17,500 in social buildings,such as schools,kindergartens,and hostels; 20,200 in apartments of relatives; and the rest in seized apartments,unfinished buildings,farms,railway carriages,or simply at roadsides.The health of families in conditions without heating,electricity,and sanitation is threatened.In summary,more than one million Azerbaijani citizens have become refugees and IDPs; 20,000 people have been killed; 50,000 have been disabled; and about 5,000 have become captives or have gone miss-ing since the aggression of Armenia.In addition,the longevity rate in the occupied territories fell to 22 to 26 births per one thousand people,which has adversely affected the demographic situation in Azerbaijan.A humanitarian emergency has taken shape in Azerbaijan because of Armenia’s armed aggression and ethnic cleansing.This fact is reflected in UN Security Council resolutions.Resolution 822 of 30 April 1993 expressed a deep concern over the displacement of a great number of civilians and a humanitarian emergency in the region.[11] In resolution 853 of 29 July 1993,the council again expressed its concern over the displacement of a great number of civilians and a humanitarian emergency in Azerbaijan.Again,that resolution reveals 49 Elkhan Suleymanov/Vurgun Suleymanov the situation in the region,stressing that the displacement of civilians was taking place in Azerbaijan.[12] Resolution 874 of 14 October 1993 also expressed serious concern over the sufferings of people due to aggression,the humanitarian emer-gency in the region,and the displacement of a great number of civilians in Azerbaijan.[13] In Resolution 884,dated 12 November 1993,the council expressed its serious concern over the displacement of a great number of civilians and the humanitarian emergency in Zangilan District,in the town of Horadiz,and along the southern border of Azerbaijan.[14] Resolution 48/114,dated 20 December 1993 and called “Humanitar-ian emergency to refugees and IDPs in Azerbaijan,” expressed serious concern over the displacement of a great number of civilians and the deteriorating humanitarian emergency in Azerbaijan.This resolution confirms that the number of refugees and IDPs in Azerbaijan had ex-ceeded one million people because of Armenia’s aggression.[20] Reso-lution 62/243 of 14 March 2008 states,“The situation in the occupied territories of Azerbaijan,” the UN Security Council noted the negative consequences of the Nagorno Karabakh conflict on the development and humanitarian situation in the South Caucasus.[22] The 11th Summit of the Organization of the Islamic Conference (OIC)in Dakar,Senegal,on 13-14 March 2008,adopted Resolution 10/11-P (IS),“On the Aggression of the Republic of Armenia Against the Repub-lic of Azerbaijan.” This document says that the OIC “is deeply concerned over the fact that over one million Azerbaijanis have become refugees and IDPs following the aggression of Armenia and this big humanitar-ian problem is severe.” Article 21 of this resolution says that the OIC “expresses concern over the severity of the humanitarian problems due to the presence of over a million refugees and IDPs in the territory of the Republic of Azerbaijan.” [53] Thus,the humanitarian emergency after Armenia’s armed aggres-sion against Azerbaijan has been identified in resolutions of influential international organizations.51 4 DAMAGES TO AZERBAIJANI HISTORICAL AND CULTURAL MONUMENTS FOLLOWING THE ARMENIAN OCCUPATION During the occupation of Azerbaijani territories,Armenian armed units barbarically destroyed national and cultural monuments of the Azerbaijani people and inflicted damages on the Azerbaijani cultural heritage—an integral part of the world culture.This destruction and vandalism was a grave violation of provisions of the Hague Conven-tion for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict (1954); the Paris Convention for Prevention of Illicit Traffic in Cultural Property (1970); the European Convention on the Protec-tion of the Archaeological Heritage (1992); and the UNECSO Con-vention Concerning the Protection of the World Cultural and Natural Heritage (1972).For example,the first human dwellings,such as the well-known caves of Azix and Taglar,and the burial mounds of Garakopak,Uzarliktapa,in the occupied territory are now used for military purposes,and any-thing of historical value has been destroyed intentionally.Along with the burial mounds in Khojali,Agdam,Agdara,Fuzuly,and Jabrail Districts,52 Invasion of Azerbaijani Lands by Armenia and Heavy Consequences of Occupation cemeteries,sepulchers,gravestones,mosques,temples,and monuments that belonged to Caucasian Albania and to other cultural heritages of Azerbaijan were destroyed.The armed forces of the occupying state destroyed the mosques of Ashagi,Yukhari,Govharaga,Kocharli,Mardinli,and Juma • the museum houses of genius composer Uzeyir Hajibayov and the founder of professional vocal art,Bulbul • The Khurshud Banu Natavan’s palace complex • the estates of Firudin bay Kocharli and the Zohrabbayovs • the home of poet,artist,and scientist Mir Movsun Navvab • the majority of dwellings containing peculiarities of oriental ar-chitecture • the ancient cemetery • the sepulcher of the great Azerbaijani poet and a vizier of the Karabakh khan,Mirza Panah Vaqif • the territory of Shusha’s historical-architectural reserve • The Panah Khan’s estate • the Juma mosque in Agdam • the palaces of Hamza Sultan and Soltan Ahmad • mosques,sanctuaries,temples and stone statues • ancient graves and burial mounds • dwelling houses with historical importance in Lachin District In addition,culture monuments were removed to Yerevan.And the destruction of the Azerbaijani people’s material culture across the oc-cupied territories continues.The occupiers conduct wide-scale and un-professional archeological excavations that destroy burial mounds,and they take looted finds to Armenia.Thirteen monuments of world importance (6 architectural and 7 ar-cheological),292 of state importance (119 architectural and 173 archeo-logical),and 330 of local importance (270 architectural,22 archeologi-cal,23 parks,monumental,and memorial monuments,15 decorative art samples)remain in the ancient Azerbaijani lands of Nagorno Karabakh and adjacent regions occupied by Armenia.53 Elkhan Suleymanov/Vurgun Suleymanov Remaining in territories under occupation are 22 museums with over 40,000 exhibits; 927 libraries with 4.6 million books; 808 clubs; 4 theater and 2 concert facilities; 31 mosques; 9 historical palaces; 8 parks of culture and recreation; 4 picture galleries; 85 musical schools; 103,200 pieces of furniture; 5,640 musical instruments; 481 cinema units; 20 movie cameras; 423 videotape recorders; 5,920 items of national clothing; 40 loudspeakers; and 25 large and 40 small attractions.The Agdam Bread museum,the only one in the former USSR,was razed during the bombing of the town.About 13,000 valuable and rare exhibits of the world-famous Kalbajar museum of historical and re-gional studies and over 5,000 exhibits of the Lachin museum of histori-cal and regional studies were taken to Armenia.Eight museum,31 libraries,17 clubs,and 8 houses of culture were razed during the occupation of Shusha.Many exhibits were looted,in-cluding about 5,000 exhibits from the Shusha historical museum • about 1,000 exhibits from the Shusha branch of the Azerbaijani State Museum of Carpet and Popular Applied Art and the State Karabakh Historical Museum • over 300 exhibits from the museum house of composer Uzeyir Hajibayov,the founder of Azerbaijani professional music • more than 400 exhibits from the museum house of Bulbul,the founder of vocal art • more than 100 exhibits from the memorial museums of famous musician and artist Mir Movsum Navvab • more than 2,000 exhibits from the Agdam museum of historical and regional studies • more than 3,000 exhibits from the Gubadli museum of historical and regional studies • about 6,000 exhibits from the Zangilan museum of historical and regional studies The memorial museum of famous Azerbaijan musician Gurban Pirimov in the Agdam District and the museum of historical and regional studies of the districts of Jabrail,Fuzuly,and Khojali were destroyed as well.54 Invasion of Azerbaijani Lands by Armenia and Heavy Consequences of Occupation The memorial museum of the prominent Azerbaijani musician Gurban Pirimov in Agdam,and the Jabrail,Fuzuly,and Khojali museums of history and regional studies have been destroyed.Valuable items related to the history and culture of the Azerbaijani,such as paintings and sculptures,world-renowned Azerbaijani carpets,carpet products,memorial articles of prominent Azerbaijani personalities were also looted by Armenian aggressors.The Shusha,Lachin,and Gubadli art galleries,holding works of famous Azerbaijani artists and sculptors,were destroyed.Armenian aggressors took statues of the great Azerbaijan music figures Uzeyir Hajibayov and Bulbul,as well as of poet Khurshud Banu Natavan from Shusha to the territory of Armenia.Contrary to the norms of morality,these monuments were savagely shot and damaged.They were bought back to Baku with great difficulties and are now on display at the Museum of Fine Arts.Thus,the amount of humanitarian,cultural,and historical damages suffered by Azerbaijan is immeasurable.Armenian aggressors have im-pudently looted facilities that constituted the cultural heritage of Azer-baijan.It’s impossible to determine the price of these destroyed ancient,irreplaceable,valuable monuments of culture.Armenia’s military occupation of the Azerbaijani territories has led to a humanitarian emergency,to the destruction of numerous social and economic facilities,and to heavy damages to the national economy.The Azerbaijani’s historical,material,and cultural monuments also sus-tained heavy damages; it is impossible to determine the value of these losses and the cost of moral damages to the Azerbaijani people them-selves.55 5 DAMAGE TO THE ENVIRONMENT AND NATURAL RESOURCES IN THE OCCUPIED AZERBAIJANI TERRITORIES A total of 1.7 million hectares of Azerbaijani territories was occupied after the armed aggression of Armenia in 1988-1994.These are the mountainous parts of the Lesser Caucasus,which include large forested areas containing 25 percent of the forests in the country.Moreover,wildlife sanctuaries and rare species of fauna and flora are widespread there.More than 460 species of trees and bushes in this region,including 70 species,do not naturally grow in other parts of the world.Taxus baccata,Corylus colurna,Quercus araxi,Pterocarya pterocarpa,Platanus orientalis,Punica granatum,Vitis silvestris,ilex hyrcana Pojark,Buxus,Pinus eldarica,Diospyros lotus,Pyrus salicifolia,and other species in the occupied lands are on the brink of extinction.At the same time,four species of mammals,eight species of birds,one species of fish,three species of amphibians and reptiles,eight species of insects,and twenty-seven species of plants were under conservation by Azerbaijan in those territories.56 Invasion of Azerbaijani Lands by Armenia and Heavy Consequences of Occupation Protected wildlife areas totaled 890,000 hectares,and several pre-serves and protected areas were built to conserve the natural land-scape and the rare fauna and flora of the Lesser Caucasus in Azer-baijan in the years prior to the Nagorno Karabakh conflict.Armenia occupied 42,997 hectares of these lands.The invaluable and diverse trees and wildlife are currently being looted and ruined by Armenia in the Bastichay State Nature Preserve,the Garagol State Nature Preserve,the pre-Araz State Nature Protected Area,the Lachin Dis-trict State Nature Protected Area,the Gubadli District State Nature Protected Area,and the Dashalti State Nature Protected Area.For example,the 107-hectare Bastichay State Nature Protected Area,which was set up in 1974 to preserve Platanus orienta-lis in the Bastichay valley in the territory of Zangilan District in southwest Azerbaijan is under occupation.The Platanus orienta-lis forest ran along 12 kilometers of riverbank,and its nearly five-hundred-year-old trees are included in the Red Data Book of the Republic of Azerbaijan.Another example is the Lachin District State Nature Protected Area,which was set up in 1961.With a total area of 21,400 hectares,it was inhabited by Caucasian goats (400),roe deer (500),boars (400),partridges (800),and ptarmi-gans (2,500).However,Armenian occupants have destroyed the habitat of this wildlife.In all,247,352 hectares,including 13,197.5 hectares of forest,152 wildlife sanctuaries,and five geological objects,are in the oc-cupied territories occupied.Most of these very important natural areas have already been destroyed by the occupying country.For example,the Corylus colurna forests,covering an area of 968 hect-ares (included in the Red Data Book of the Republic of Azerbaijan)in Kalbajar District,are being felled and sold abroad.More than four thousand species of plants in the district,including about two hundred medical herbs,are being looted and exported by foreign companies in violation of international law.This leads to the extinc-tion of those species and the destruction of the region’s biodiversity.Armenia is currently pursuing a policy of ecocide against nature in Azerbaijan.The pulp and paper industry is flourishing in Armenia at the expense of forests in the occupied territories.In 1993 alone,206,600 57 Elkhan Suleymanov/Vurgun Suleymanov cubic meters of trees were transported to Armenia from the occu-pied territories.Irretrievable damage has also been inflicted on the fauna.The pro-tected area in Lachin District is being destroyed,and Armenians are fell-ing Quercus rubra in the Hacisamli forest there for sale abroad.Quer-cus araxi,Platanus orientalis,and Juglans regia trees in the Bastichay Protected Area,which are used to manufacture decorative furniture and parquet,are also being cut down.The 240-hectare Garagol Protected Area is under the threat of total destruction,with its 68 species of plants from 27 plant families.The 13,160-hectare forest area in Gubadli Dis-trict has been destroyed too.Armenians had carried 720,000 cubic me-ters of trees out of the occupied territories by 2005.The 114-meter-long,limestone Khan Cave,at 1,365 meters above sea level,was also under conservation before the conflict.According to information from different sources,they are being brutally destroyed and used for other purposes.The environmental balance is being shattered in many lakes in the Azerbaijani territories under occupation.Seven lakes containing fresh water—Boyuk Alagol,Kichik Alagol,Zalkhagol,Garagol,Janligol,and Isigli Garagol in the summer pasture areas of Kalbajar and Lachin Districts,and Garagol in Agdara District (in the Toragachay,which is a branch of the Tartar)—remain under occupation.There are up to 120 mineral water reserves of different composi-tions with medicinal significance in the occupied Azerbaijani terri-tories.Yukhari and Ashagi Istisu,Bagirsaq and Kesdak in Kalbajar District,Iligsu and Minkand in Lachin District,Turshsu and Sirlan in Shusha District,and other mineral waters should be especially noted.Istisu mineral water in Kalbajar District has a favorable gas and chemical composition and high temperature,with large natural reserves.These waters are good for the treatment of both inter-nal and external diseases.That’s why a large resort and a mineral water-filling factory were built over the Istisu spring in the 1980s.It produced eight hundred thousand liters of water a day.The Tur-shsu mineral water spring,seventeen kilometers from the town of Shusha,was used for the treatment of different internal diseases.This spring water was piped to Shusha as well.Overall,39.6 per-58 Invasion of Azerbaijani Lands by Armenia and Heavy Consequences of Occupation cent of the total geological reserves of mineral water in Azerbaijan are in the territories currently under occupation.The water supplies and irrigation systems in the districts near the Azerbaijani territories occupied by Armenian armed forces have also been disrupted,which negatively affects the soil and vegetation.Irriga-tion farming and water supplies to towns and villages are vital for Azer-baijan,which is considered a dry region.The Lesser Caucasus Moun-tains,with their many river networks,are very important in the formation of water reserves for Azerbaijan,but they are under occu-pation.All the branches originating from these mountains,especially the branches of the river Kura—Tartar,Hakari,Khachinchay,Kondalanchay,and oth-ers—used to bring ample water to the plains areas,and artificial lakes and irrigation canals were built on some of them.The Sarsang reservoir,which is 125 meters high and has a capacity of 560 million cubic meters of water,was built on the Tartar River in 1976 and is now held by Armenia.Before the occupation,the mains canals from that reservoir supplied water to 79,000 hectares of farm-land in the plains areas of Tartar,Agdam,Barda,Goranboy,and other districts.Now seven districts of Azerbaijan can no longer take water from the reservoir.Now an Azerbaijani population of 400,000 lives un-der the threat of the reservoir being shut down,because it has not been maintained.The Armenians release water from the reservoir in winter,flooding the land and destroying roads.In summer,when people and agriculture need water,they block it.This has hampered agricultural production; vegetation has gone dry,and serious ecological tension has emerged in the region.The 1,203-kilometer irrigation infrastructure and the water system in the Nagorno Karabakh region—comprising five water reservoirs with a total space of 674 million cubic meters,7,296 hydrotechnical facilities,36 pumping stations,and 26 irrigation systems—have been destroyed.A total of 120,000 hectares of land in five districts outside the occu-pied territories of Azerbaijan are left without water and sidelined from economic activity because of the destruction of the irrigation system,which is part of the integrated irrigation infrastructure of Azerbaijan.In all,more than a million hectares of land,including 127,700 hectares of 59 Elkhan Suleymanov/Vurgun Suleymanov irrigated land and 34,600 hectares of vineyards and fruit gardens,have become useless for farming.Armenia is intentionally polluting cross-border rivers flowing through the territory of Azerbaijan with poisonous substances,including the rivers Araz and Agstafa.It should also be mentioned that about 70 percent of river-water resources in Azerbaijan is in transit rivers.Regional covenants against the pollution of rivers make the significant contamination of rivers flowing through the territory of a third country a serious violation of international law.The reservoir built at the border on the Agstafa River,which is eco-nomically important for Azerbaijan’s western districts,is also at risk due to the destruction or occupation of Ashagi Askipara,Yukhari Askipara,Gushchu Ayrim,Barkhudarly,and other villages in Gazax District.The 72.3-kilometer-long irrigation canal from the Agstafa reservoir,which has a capacity of 120 million cubic meters,supplied water to the foot-hill farms and residential areas in Gazax,Agstafa,Tovuz,and Shamkir Districts.The richest reserves of natural resources of Azerbaijan are also in the territories occupied by Armenia.There are 155 mineral deposits,in-cluding 5 gold,6 mercury,2 copper,1 lead and zinc deposits; 19 facade stone and 10 stone deposits; 4 deposits if raw materials for cement; 13 deposits if different types of stone; 1 field for production of soda; 21 de-posits of pumice and volcanic ash; 10 clay deposits,9 sand and gravel deposits; 5 construction sand deposits; 9 gypsum and anhydride depos-its; 1 pearlite field; 1 obsidian field; 3 vermiculite deposits; 14 deposits of nonferrous metals (agate,jasper,onyx,pefritoid,etc.); 11 sweet un-derground water reservoirs; and 10 mineral waters in those territories.This was very important for the economic potential of Azerbaijan.The mentioned minerals were discovered in Gizilbulag,Mehmana,Damirli,Janyataq-gulyataq,Agdara,Shorbulaq,Shusha,Sirlan,Turshsu,Khojali,Zarinbakh,Agchay,Khankandi,Edis,Khojavand,Soyudlu,Agduzdag,Tutkhun,Agyataq,Levchay,Kilsali,Kesdak,Kechaldag,Jalli,Yukhari Istisu,Ashagi Istisu,Mozchay,Goturlu,Jilkaz,Narzanli,Ahmadli,Ho-jaz,Lachin,Novruzlu,Yukhari Akarachay,Gushchu,Minkand,Hajili,Khanlig,Gubadli,Vejnali,Bartaz,Ohchuchay,Zangilan,Sarifan,Tuluz,Garajali,Soltanli,Chakhmakhchay,Goyarchin-Veysalli,Minbashili,60 Invasion of Azerbaijani Lands by Armenia and Heavy Consequences of Occupation Agtapa,Jafarabad,Shahverdilar,Chakhmakhgaya,Dovlatyarli,Dilagar-di,Kurdmahmudlu,Guruchay,Shahbulaq,Gulabli,Chobandag,Boyah-madli,Shahbulaq,Agdam,Gargarchay,and Khachinchay.In these de-posits are proved reserves of 132,600 tons of gold,37,300 tons of lead,40,400 tons of zinc,189 million cubic meters of stone,1,526,000 tons of gypsum,and 1,968,000 cubic meters of underground fresh water.There are 18,432,000 cubic meters of facade stones,23,243,000 cubic meters of clay,57,965,000 tons of construction stone,7,805 cubic me-ters/day of mineral water,96,987,000 tons of sand and gravel,1,898,400 tons of mercury,4,473,000 cubic meters of pearlite,2,144,000 cubic meters of pumice,129,833,000 cubic meters of lime for soda produc-tion,and 147,108,000 tons of raw materials for cement production and other purposes.It is understood that the aggressor country established illegal contracts with several foreign companies and is exploiting the mineral resources of Azerbaijan in violation of international law.Armenia is pursuing a policy of barbarically exploiting and devastat-ing the mineral resources of the occupied territories.The minerals ex-tracted from two gold deposits,four mercury deposits,two chromium deposits,one lead-zinc deposit,one copper deposit,and one antimony deposit are being transported to processing companies in Armenia.An example of the illegal use of Azerbaijan’s mineral assets is a contract with the Canada-based First Dinesty Mines Company in the joint opera-tion and exploitation of the Soyudlu gold deposit in Kalbajar District.Armenia extracts more than thirteen tons of gold a year from that de-posit.And its occupying forces are illegally exploiting the Vajnali and Gizil Bulag gold deposits in Zangilan and Kalbajar Districts.In addition,Armenia heavily pollutes the natural water sources flowing through the occupied territories of Azerbaijan.The Ohchuchay and Agstafacay rivers,which are branches of the Kura and Araz,are heavily contaminated.The Armenian aggressors are also pursuing a “scorched earth” policy,in all the occupied territories.Armenia deliberately and regularly sets fire to the territories of Agdam,Fuzuly,Jabrail,Tartar,and Khojavand Districts in the contact line.Many covenants regulating state borders between countries envisage that a state is obliged to do everything possible to make sure a fire in its territory is extinguished before it 61 Elkhan Suleymanov/Vurgun Suleymanov jumps its border with the neighboring state.But the opposite is taking place.Armenia deliberately causes fires in the occupied Azerbaijani territories.Most fires are likely set for military purposes—to clean up the area to monitor the Azerbaijani army’s movements.Such deliberate fires have caused damage to the territories under Azerbaijan’s control.As a result,soil is eroded and the unique fauna and flora come under the risk of extinction.Fires intentionally set by Armenia have engulfed thousands of hect-ares of land in the occupied territories,have spread to other territories of Azerbaijan,and have caused irreversible damage to the environment.Some rare species of vegetation have been destroyed,and some farm-land has been made useless.The Armenian military burned 17,457 hect-ares of pasture only in the occupied villages of Novruzlu,Yusifjanli,Marzili,Bash Garvand,Kangarli,Jalik,Garadagli-Kangarlisi,Goytapa and Gulculuk and Uzundara,Yeddikhirman and Shahbulag mountains in Agdam District.Numbers of partridges,pheasants,and vipers,which are included in the Red Data Book and the Red List of the International Union for Conservation of Nature,died in the fires.[54] In all,96,000 hectares of pasture,hay,and green areas such as forests have burned,and the fertile upper layer of the soil has been made useless.According to preliminary calculations,the direct damage inflicted on the environ-ment because of the fires was more than 223 million US dollars (176 million Azerbaijani manats).[55] The Azerbaijani have officially informed the secretary-general of the Bern Convention on the Conservation of European Wildlife and Natu-ral Habitats,the executive secretary of the Convention on Biodiversity,the secretariat of the UN Convention on the Climate Change,and the president of the International Union for the Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources about criminal acts against the natural habitat and humanity in the territories occupied by Armenia,stressing the urgent need for action to eliminate the occupation and prevent criminal acts against wildlife.63 6 SOCIO-ECONOMIC IMPACT OF ARMENIA’S OCCUPATION OF AZERBAIJAN Besides humanitarian and environmental emergencies in the wake of the conflict and the occupation of a fifth of Azerbaijan’s territories,the industrial and agricultural infrastructure in those territories has been destroyed,causing much damage to the country’s economy.The industries once operating in the occupied territories were important for the Azerbaijani economy.Food,textile,and construction enterprises were the most developed.Strong agriculture,raw materials,and local natural reserves facilitated the development of these industries.The most developed industries in the occupied territories were butter and cheese for the local population,wine,and textiles.The Nagorno Karabakh Autonomous Region was the fourth among the economic regions of the former Azerbaijan Soviet Socialist Republic (after Absheron,Ganja-Gazakh,and the Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic)due to the type and level of development of its industries.The industrial potential of the occupied territories was concentrated in Nagorno Karabakh,as most of the industrial and construction enter-prises (137)were in the territories of that region.About 40 percent of all the industrial output and 18.7 percent of the fixed assets in the occupied districts were in this region,while 5 percent of the industrial output 64 Invasion of Azerbaijani Lands by Armenia and Heavy Consequences of Occupation and 41 percent of the fixed assets were in Fuzuly and Agdam Districts.These districts were second in industry and construction (51 percent of industrial output and 41 percent of fixed assets).Industry was poor-ly developed in the remaining five districts:Lachin,Kalbajar,Jabrail,Gubadli,and Zangilan.In 1988,2.7 percent of the overall industrial output of the Azerbaijan SSR and 3.4 percent of the fixed assets were generated in the occupied districts.The following are the shares of the occupied districts in different types of industry before the Nagorno Karabakh conflict in the Republic of Azerbaijan:wall materials,11 percent • construction limestone,7.8 • construction materials,3 percent • shoes,11 percent • meat,5 percent • canned food,6.9 percent • cow butter,25.2 percent • wines,35 percent • raw silk,13.5 percent • wool,19.3 percent • mineral water,15 percent Istisu and Turshsu mineral water bottling enterprises; marble and stone enterprises in Nagorno Karabakh and Agdam; high-quality Agdam wines,which were renowned in the Soviet Union; butter-and cheese-producing enterprises; weaving and shoe-making plants; the Karabakh Silk Group; and other facilities were operating in those territories.More than fifty new branches of the enterprises situated in Baku have re-mained in the occupied territories.In all,more than 183 industrial and 127 construction enterprises have remained in that region.Strong communication and transportation lines were also estab-lished in the region.As a result of the Armenian aggression,25,000 ki-lometers of roads,160 bridges with a total length of 3,984 meters,14.5 kilometers of electricity lines,2,500 transformers,2,300 kilometers of water lines,2,000 kilometers of gas pipes,240 kilometers of sew-65 Elkhan Suleymanov/Vurgun Suleymanov age lines,160 water reservoirs,more than 34 gas distribution facilities,and automatic telephone exchanges for 35,000 numbers have been de-stroyed.At the same time,four airports,the Baku-Agdam and Horadiz-Ordubad railways,the Baku-Stepanakert-Nakhchivan gas pipeline,and other lines of transportation and communication remain in the occupied territories.The territories under Armenian occupation were also Azerbaijan’s largest agricultural regions.The occupied parts of Lesser Caucasus,which have mountainous plains and foothills favorable to farming as well as pastures with good humidity,opened up immense opportunities for the development of plant growing and cattle breeding in the coun-try.Grain growing,food production,vine growing,tobacco cultivation,potato growing,cotton growing,and cattle and sheep breeding were important industries in agriculture.Vine growing,which has been developed since ancient times,in-creased after the 1970s.Large Soviet collective and state farms with new technology and wine-making plants were established to develop vine growing and viniculture.One of the developing industries in the region was tobacco cultivation.But many agricultural enterprises,in-cluding state and collective farms,economic unions,and agricultural firms,ceased operation after the attacks by Armenia.A total of 7,296 water facilities,36 pumping stations,26 irrigation systems,18 main irrigation facilities,1,200 kilometers of irrigation ca-nals,and 5,600 kilometers of farm systems have been disabled,and 127,700 hectares of quality arable land remains in the occupied ter-ritories.Hundreds of thousands of ethnic Azerbaijanis,who have become IDPs due to ethnic cleansing in the occupied territories,have been de-prived of agricultural products on their own native land.In addition,the plain areas temporarily populated by IDPs have different soil and climate conditions,so it’s very difficult for IDPs to cultivate their old products in new areas.It should be noted that 14.3 percent of grain,31.5 percent of grapes,14.5 percent of meat,17.1 percent of milk,19.3 percent of wool,and 17 percent of cotton in the Republic of Azerbaijan were produced in the occupied districts.These were ecologically pure and high-quality 66 Invasion of Azerbaijani Lands by Armenia and Heavy Consequences of Occupation agricultural products.Armenia’s aggression has inflicted damage on the highly developed cattle-breeding industry in these districts.Many investments were made in those territories,taxes were reduced,and household farms were de-veloped to eliminate socioeconomic backwardness.All these activities enabled the development of cattle breeding in the mountainous districts.The sudden occupation made it impossible to market the cattle herds.The cattle taken out of these districts in small numbers died on their way to market because of hunger and thirst.A total of 311 agricultural enterprises,including 145 newly estab-lished vine-growing and wine-making facilities with new technology (especially the Agdam horse farm,which bred Karabakh horses),135 collective farms,and 31 farm enterprises were destroyed following the occupation of the Azerbaijani territories.In addition,1,365 cars,3,425 farming tractors,trailers,and harvesters,7,296 water installations,62 water pumps and irrigation units,1,200 kilometers of farm irrigation canals,645,500 hectares of arable land,185,500 hectares of farming areas,and 40,000 hectares of young vine plantations have been ruined.Every year an average of 79,400 tons of grain,20,500 tons of cotton,324,300 tons of grapes,23,500 tons of potatoes,and other crops can’t be harvested,and more than 313,100 livestock—including 111,200 cows and buffalos,1,098,000 sheep and goats—have been stolen and taken out of the country.In addition,20,000 tons of meat,75,500 tons of milk,and 846 tons of annual cattle products were lost.About 70 percent of the summer pastures of Azerbaijan are now under occupation.Before the conflict,the Azerbaijani government had begun to develop the productive capacities of the mountainous regions,in-cluding Nagorno Karabakh.For this purpose,wide-scale construc-tion work started in that and other districts now under Armenian occupation.Construction entities were set up and new machinery and vehicles were brought to the region.Powerful enterprises pro-ducing construction materials,including a marble plant in Nagorno Karabakh,were built.All the logistics for these enterprises were devastated during the occpation,and planned projects could not be implemented.Much direct damage along the frontline has also been done.Most 67 Elkhan Suleymanov/Vurgun Suleymanov residential areas in the districts bordering Armenia have been devastated; civilians have fled their homes; and socieconomic,cultural,industrial,and agricultural enterprises have been ruined.In all,much damage has been inflicted on the Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic,Agstafa,Agjabadi,Gazakh,Tovuz,Gadabay,Tartar,and Beylagan Districts.In summary,more than 900 residential areas (towns,settlements,vil-lages,etc.); about 150,000 houses and flats with a total space of 9.1 million square meters; 4,366 social and cultural objects; 7,000 social buildings; 2,389 industrial and agricultural objects; 1,025 schools; 855 kindergartens; 4 sanatoriums; 798 healthcare facilities,including 695 hospitals; 927 libraries; 1,510 cultural entities; and 598 communica-tion facilities have been ruined in the Azerbaijani territories since the armed aggression of Armenia.Moreover,5,198 kilometers of roads,348 bridges,286 kilometers of railways,116 railway bridges,224 wa-ter reservoirs,7,568 kilometers of water lines,2,000 kilometers of gas pipes,and 76,940 kilometers of electricity lines have been destroyed.As can be seen,the occupation of Armenia has done much socioeco-nomic damage,has created a humanitarian emergency,has done irre-trievable damage to the historic and national artifacts of the Azerbaijani people,and has destroyed natural resources.69 7 TOTAL AMOUNT OF MATERIAL DAMAGE TO AZERBAIJAN AS A RESULT OF THE OCCUPATION BY ARMENIA Because of the armed aggression by Armenia and occupation of 20 percent of the territory of Azerbaijan,tens of thousands of Azerbaijanis died or became disabled.In addition,hundreds of thousands of citizens were evicted from their native lands and turned into forced migrants with no rights and freedoms.An emergency humanitarian situation emerged in Azerbaijan,and thousands of Azerbaijanis are still considered wounded.None of the consequences of the aggression failed to have an impact on the Azerbaijani families; every Azerbaijani family became a victim of the Nagorno Karabakh war.In these conditions,it is impossible to assess in any units the psychological and moral situation in Azerbaijan.Furthermore,because of the aggression,national and cultural monu-ments of the Azerbaijani people were destroyed,and the cultural heri-tage of Azerbaijan—part of the culture of the nations of the world— suffered irreparable losses.It is practically impossible to evaluate the value of these monuments and the scale of the moral damage to the Azerbaijani people because of this.Because of the criminal activities of Armenia in the occupied ter-70 Invasion of Azerbaijani Lands by Armenia and Heavy Consequences of Occupation ritories of Azerbaijan during the invasion and since,the natural re-sources of the region were plundered,fires were systematically set,and irreparable damage was done to the region’s flora and fauna,to biological diversity,and to the environment in general.At present it is impossible to assess comprehensively the damage done by the criminal activities of Armenia.The losses suffered by the Azerbaijani population can be divided into two categories:losses as direct results of the war and losses in the years after the war.The 25 October 1996 letter of the Azerbaijani permanent mission to the United Nations Secretary General showed that,according to preliminary and incomplete information,the overall damage to Azerbaijan because of the invasion of Armenia ran into tens of billions of US dollars.[2] For example,the section on Azerbaijan in Resolution 2/11-C (İS),called “On the Activities Related to Rendering Economic Assistance to OIC Member States and Non-Member States and Muslim Communities” and adopted at the 11th Islamic Summit Conference (Session of Muslim Ummah in the 21st Century)on 13-14 March 2008,states that “the overall economic damage to Azerbaijan in the territories occupied by Armenia is 60bn US dollars.” [56] Out of that 60 billion dollars of damage to Azerbaijan (in 1994 prices),more than 30 billion dollars are economic losses incurred because of the occupation of the former Nagorno Karabakh Autono-mous Region.It is enough to say that in Shusha District alone,which was part of the former Nagorno Karabakh Autonomous Region ad-ministrative area,calculations show the material damage to Azer-baijan to be approximately 4,257,474,000 dollars.[57] The damage dealt by the invaders to 248 historical monuments,including the grave of the Azerbaijani poet and statesman M.P.Vagif,the Dashalti State Nature Reserve,and the Khan Cave paleontological monu-ment was not included in this amount of material damage because it is impossible to quantify their value.(See appendix 1.)Just in seven occupied districts adjacent to the Nagorno Karabakh but not part of it,the direct material losses in 1994 prices stood at 28.066 billion dollars.The following figures show the direct material 71 Elkhan Suleymanov/Vurgun Suleymanov damage across districts in terms of US dollars (at 1994 prices):• Kalbajar District—$1,774,000,000 [58] • Agdam District—$6,100,107,000 [59] • Fuzuly District—$4,742,932,050 [60] • Gubadli District—$1,485,627,000 [61] • Jabrail District—$3,450,300,000 [62] • Zangilan District—$3,414,170,000 [63] • Lachin District—$7,099,526,500 [64] (See appendix 2.)In addition,because of the armed invasion,the frontline districts and districts on the border with Armenia suffered large,direct material losses.According to the 1994 prices,this damage was 1,400,233,284 US dollars.According to information supplied by district executive au-thorities,the material damage to the districts in terms of US dollars because of the occupation is as follows (in 1994 prices):• Tartar and Agdara Districts—799,295,100 [65] • Gazakh District—327,529,464 [66] • Tovuz District—189,873,420 [67] • Agjabadi District— 33,420,050 [68] • Agstafa District—1,998,950 [69] • Beylagan District—3,812,500 [70] • Gadabay District—44,303,800 [71] (See appendix 3.)The amounts shown do not reflect the material damage dealt to the Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic during the conflict.Ar-menia blocked this republic before the war; military attacks were made against the Autonomous Republic; and two settlements were and still are occupied.Because of the blockade,there were serious difficulties with supplying the Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic with consumer goods,natural gas,and oil products,and the Azerbaijani government spent quite a bit to tackle these problems.Therefore,because of the Armenian aggression,the Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic of Azerbaijan not only lost many of its people,but also incurred large material losses.How-72 Invasion of Azerbaijani Lands by Armenia and Heavy Consequences of Occupation ever,this damage is not reflected in this study.Hence,out of the 60 billion dollars (in 1994 prices)of material losses of Azerbaijan resulting from the armed invasion and occupation of Ar-menia,28.066 billion dollars were incurred in the seven currently oc-cupied districts adjacent to the former Nagorno Karabakh Autonomous Region and 1,400,233,284 US dollars in the frontline and border dis-tricts.Considering the amount of material damage to the Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic,this adds up to 29.466 billion dollars.Note that from 1994 to 2011,the US dollar was subject to infla-tion,and its international purchasing ability dropped several times over.Hence,while the direct material damage to Azerbaijan stood at 60 bil-lion US dollars,which is the international reserve currency,this amount has to be recalculated,taking into consideration the change in the pur-chasing ability of the dollar on the world markets from 1994 to 2011.The international price of gold is one indicator of the dollar’s pur-chasing ability.To use this measure,we must look at the price of the gold on the world market since 1994.Gold prices remained almost sta-ble from the second half of the twentieth century to the end of 2001; in 2001,one ounce fetched 276.50 dollars.However,from 2002 on,gold became more expensive,while the dollar lost its purchasing power; in 2011 the average price of one ounce of gold was around 1,500 dollars.Therefore,the international price of gold increased fivefold between 2002 and 2011,and with such inflation,the dollar’s purchasing power dropped accordingly.[72] Thus,because of the 1994 armed aggression and occupation by Armenia,Azerbaijan incurred 60 billion US dollars of material damage,which is more than 300 billion dollars,according to the 2011 prices.It must also be noted that the amount of material damage dealt to Azerbaijan has been increasing from year to year.Before the occupation,the former Nagorno Karabakh Autonomous Region produced about 15 percent of Azerbaijan’s gross domestic production.The other seven occupied districts produced about 10 percent of Azerbaijan’s GDP.Therefore,because of Armenia’s occupation of the Azerbaijani territories,Azerbaijan has been losing about 25 percent of its GDP every year.The following formula shows how the GDP of Azerbaijan prior to 73 Elkhan Suleymanov/Vurgun Suleymanov the occupation was calculated:T = A + O T stands for Azerbaijan’s full GDP,O for the GDP of the currently occupied territories,and A for the GDP of the non-occupied territories of Azerbaijan.Simple calculation shows O = 0.25 T,and thus we derive O = A / 3 Calculations show that Azerbaijan has been losing one-third of the GDP of its non-occupied territories.By substituting the GDP figures for the Azerbaijani Republic in the years 1995-2010,based on official reports of the State Committee for Statistics,we can calculate the lost GDP of the occupied territories,which are shown in the following table.Following the Armenian armed aggression and occupation,the amount of revenue lost by the Republic of Azerbaijan during 1995-2010 (in US dollars).Years GDP for occupied territories,A,million,in US dollars GDP lost in occupied territories,O,million,in US dollars 1995 2415,2 805,1 1996 3180,8 1060,3 1997 3960,7 1320,2 1998 4446,4 1482,1 1999 4583,7 1527,9 2000 5272,8 1757,6 2001 5707,7 1902,6 2002 6235,9 2078,6 2003 7276,0 2425,3 2004 8680,4 2893,5 2005 13238,7 4412,9 2006 20983,0 6994,3 2007 33050,3 11016,8 2008 46258,2 15419,4 74 Invasion of Azerbaijani Lands by Armenia and Heavy Consequences of Occupation *Figures in this column are from the official report from the Statis-tics Committee of the Azerbaijani Republic.[73] Evidently,because of Armenia’s aggression,from 1995 to 2010,Azerbaijan lost 86,702,000,000 US dollars in revenue.After the occu-pation of its territories by Armenia,Azerbaijan made serious efforts and carried out consistent and comprehensive measures for the elimination of the humanitarian emergency.As of May 2012,67 new settlements have been built for refugees and IDPs in various towns and districts of Azerbaijan,with over 100,000 IDPs resettled in new houses.A to-tal of 130 education,about 50 health,and dozens of communications and cultural facilities have been built and commissioned.The state also has been covering the costs of housing utilities under this category and paying subsidies to the residents.As of 13 May 2011,the government of Azerbaijan had spent 4.684 billion dollars (3.7 billion manats)on refugees and IDPs,according to the state committee for refugees and IDPs.Of these expenses,740 million dollars were contributed by inter-national aid organizations and 3.994 million dollars by the Azerbaijani State and the State Oil Fund.[74] After the occupation,the damage to the Azerbaijani natural resourc-es and ecology has been great.In the course of military operations and because of the occupation,the natural habitat of flora and fauna in the occupied territories is being destroyed.According to rough calculations by the Ecology and Natural Resources Ministry of the Azerbaijani Re-public,through 2010,the looting of natural resources in the occupied territories,the destruction of natural landscape,rare plant,and animal world,and the disturbance of the ecological balance dealt losses to Azerbaijan of over 40.15 billion dollars (31.72 billion manats).[55] Finally,considering that Azerbaijan was dealt 300 billion dol-lars in direct social and economic damages as a result of the armed aggression and occupation,it lost 86.702 billion dollars in revenue during 1995-2010; 4.684 billion were spent on the elimination of the 2009 43016,0 14338,7 2010 51799,9 17266,6 Total (for 1995-2010)86702,0 75 Elkhan Suleymanov/Vurgun Suleymanov humanitarian emergency; and the destruction and looting of Azerbai-jani natural resources dealt losses of 40.15 billion dollars.Calculating the overall damages to Azerbaijan,we can see that this amount is colos-sal; based on figures from early 2011,it is 431.5 billion dollars.Yet this amount does not include the full material damages caused by the occupation.When calculating the amount of the revenue Azerbaijan lost from 1995 to 2010,the rate of inflation of the US dollar at the world market over those years was not considered.Moreover,the amount of damages to natural resources in the occupied lands and to the ecology was calculated based on official figures available to Azerbaijan and,no doubt,these figures do not reflect the damages from Armenia’s criminal actions,which it is trying to hide from the world community.In addi-tion,unless the conflict is resolved and Azerbaijan regains its sover-eignty in the occupied lands,its revenue loss will continue to grow.Of course,the total mentioned above does not include damages to national and cultural monuments,which are impossible to compute.The total amount also does not include the moral damage inflicted on the Azerbaijani,including refugees and IDPs; special research is need-ed to calculate those damages.These calculations are just the first step.They do not include dam-ages unknown to Azerbaijan for obvious reasons.When these are taken into consideration,the cost will no doubt be enormous.77 8 AZERBAIJAN’S RIGHT TO RECEIVE COMPENSATION FOR DAMAGE RESULTING FROM THE OCCUPATION Specifying the amount of damages Azerbaijan suffered—and still suf-fers—because of the conflict and occupation is an important aspect of settling the conflict over Nagorno Karabakh.In addition,the problem of payment has several important practical implications.First,it requires determining the amount of damage suffered by Azerbaijan due to Armenia’s aggression.According to contemporary international law,the Azerbaijani Republic has the right to file a claim for damages and receive compensation.(The mechanism for exercising this right is another topic.)Second,to a certain extent,it stops any claims by Armenia against Azerbaijan.The Armenians who left Azerbaijan claim they left property worth 70 billion US dollars.And they add 30 billion more for moral damages.[75] The Refugees and International Law civil society net-work that operates in Armenia presented a report in December 2011 that claimed the direct material losses of the Armenian refugees who left Azerbaijan was 56 billion dollars.The report said that the Armenian refugees accounted for 7 to 8 percent of the population of Azerbaijan and could not take part in the privatization of land; they asked for ei-78 Invasion of Azerbaijani Lands by Armenia and Heavy Consequences of Occupation ther 8 percent of the territory of Azerbaijan or an equivalent compensa-tion at market prices.The report also claimed that Armenians must be paid compensation from the income of the privatized organizations in Azerbaijan,especially the state oil company.And it claimed that joint ventures and foreign companies producing and exporting oil and gas in Azerbaijan must pay compensation.The report also mentions the need to assess the amount of moral damage to the Armenian refugees.[76] Third,the emergence of the issue of paying for material and moral damages to Azerbaijan once more proves and strengthens the evidence in favor of Azerbaijan with regard to the Armenian-Azerbaijani conflict over Nagorno Karabakh.This is an important factor in the information and diplomacy war with Armenia.For the armed aggression against Azerbaijan and the occupation of its territories,Armenia is responsible in terms of international law.Ar-ticle 5 of Resolution 3314 (24),«Definition of Aggression,» adopted by the UN General Assembly on 14 December 1974 says that «an aggres-sive war is a crime against world peace and the act of aggression causes international liability.» [77] Like genocide,racial discrimination,ethnic cleansing,apartheid,and humanitarian catastrophe,the act of aggression is a violation of the UN Charter and other important international documents and is con-demned as an international crime.For this reason,aggression falls un-der the jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court under article 5 of the Rome Statute,along with the crimes of genocide,war crimes,and crimes against humanity.[78] Commitments of wrongful acts fit in a special category of obliga-tions for all countries.Going against them is in breach of the common interests of the international community.Therefore,these obligations are universal,and the states are entitled to bring to responsibility any state that breaches these commitments.Hence,the armed aggression of Armenia against Azerbaijan,the genocide committed in Khojali,and the ethnic cleansing in the occu-pied territories created an international legal liability for Armenia,not just to Azerbaijan,but to the entire international community.At the same time,Azerbaijan suffered specific material and moral damage because of the aggression and occupation,and as the occupying 79 Elkhan Suleymanov/Vurgun Suleymanov state,Armenia is responsible for them.As noted,because of Armenia’s aggression,20 percent of the Azerbaijani territory was occupied and about one million people became refugees and forced migrants,while the population,territory,economy,culture,environment,and flora and fauna of Azerbaijan suffered great losses.Again,the preliminary calcu-lations show that the overall amount of material damage to Azerbaijan because of the occupation is about 431.536 billion US dollars.It is clear that the material and moral damage dealt by Armenia on Azerbaijan has to be fully compensated.In line with international law,the responsible state has to compensate for the damage the other state suffered because of acts that are considered wrongful according to in-ternational bodies.In contemporary international law,there are certain forms of repara-tion of injury.These forms require full reparation and provide ways for implementing that reparation.This issue was clearly noted in the appendix to the 12 December 2001 Resolution 56/83,«Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts,» of the UN General Assem-bly.Article 28 of the document says that the state is responsible for the wrongful act,which involves legal consequences.According to article 31,the responsible state is under obligation to make full reparation for the injury caused by the act,and the «injury» includes any damage,whether material or moral,caused by the internationally wrongful act of a state.Article 34 defines the form of reparation for injury caused by the acts:«Full reparation for the injury caused by the internationally wrongful act shall take the form of restitution,compensation and satis-faction,either singly or in combination,in accordance with the provi-sions of this chapter.» [79] This provision was reaffirmed by Resolution 60/147,«Basic Principles and Guidelines on the Right to a Remedy and Reparation for Victims of Gross Violations of International Human Rights Law and Serious Violations of International Humanitarian Law,» adopted by the UN General Assembly on 16 December 2005.Article 18 of chapter 9,«Reparation for Harm Suffered,» of this resolution says that,in accordance with domestic law and international law,and taking into account individual circumstances,victims of gross violations of international human rights law and serious violations of international 80 Invasion of Azerbaijani Lands by Armenia and Heavy Consequences of Occupation humanitarian law should,as appropriate and proportional to the gravity of the violation and the circumstances of each case,be provided with full and effective reparation,as laid out in principles 19 to 23,which include the following forms:restitution,compensation,rehabilitation,satisfaction and guarantees of non-repetition.[80] It’s clear that just restoring the situation preceding the internation-ally wrongful act is not enough for complete reparation,because such acts include not only material but also moral damage.According to article 31 of Resolution 56/83 «Responsibility of States for Interna-tionally Wrongful Acts,» of the UN General Assembly,the responsible state is under obligation to make full reparation for the injury caused by such an act,and this injury includes any damage,whether material or moral.In addition,according to commentary on article 34 of the same resolution,full reparation may be achieved in particular cases only by the combination of different forms of reparation.This depends on the nature of the international wrongful act—on the type and extent of the injury that has been caused.The form of reparation also depends on the justified intent of the injured state.Article 35 of the resolution says that the state responsible for an in-ternationally wrongful act is under obligation to make restitution,that is,to reestablish the situation that existed before the wrongful act was committed,to the extent that restitution is not materially impossible and does not involve a burden out of all proportion to the benefit deriving from restitution instead of compensation.As a result of Armenian actions that were internationally wrongful acts,the payment of the compensation in the form of restitution means the return of all the occupied Azerbaijani territories,liberation of all Azerbaijanis kept in the Armenian captivity,restoration of their human rights,allowing them to return to their previous places of habitation,returning property,and so on.The restitution also includes the abolition of the decision by the Su-preme Council of Armenia to join Nagorno Karabakh to Armenia,as well as the declaration of Nagorno Karabakh as part of Armenia in Armenia’s Act of Independence and of other illegal laws and regulations.At the same time,compliance with the demand to stop economic activities in occupied Azerbaijani territories by foreign companies based on contracts with Ar-menia must also be one of the measures carried out within the restitution.81 Elkhan Suleymanov/Vurgun Suleymanov Compensation is financial payment for damages because of interna-tionally wrongful acts.According to a commentary on article 36 of the UN General Assembly’s resolution «Responsibility of States for Inter-nationally Wrongful Acts,» the state responsible for an internationally wrongful act is under obligation to compensate to the extent that such damage is not made good by restitution.The compensation covers any financially assessable damage; thus,compensation can be made when the damages are not repaid through restitution.Compensation must pro-vide full repayment of the damage done and of the various forms of reparation.Article 36 says that the amount of compensation is based on the value of the property—not at the time it was damaged but at the time compensation is paid.Compensation is an independent form of payment for damages or can be in addition to restitution.Restitution,despite its primacy as a matter of legal principle,is frequently unavailable or inadequate.It also can be ruled out if the injured state prefers compensation.The role of compensation is to fill in gaps to ensure full reparation for damage suf-fered.In general terms,damage encompasses the damage to the state and the damage to its citizens,organizations,and commercial organiza-tions.Therefore,the injured state is entitled to claim compensation for the damage to the health of its citizens.In addition to direct physical and material losses,moral and psychological damages—for example,the loss of relatives,suffering,insults,illegal detention of civilians,tor-ture,and crippling also require compensation.There can be questions regarding the impact of time on the com-pensation for internationally wrongful acts,affecting its volume and amount.Practice shows that even if a long time has passed,the right to compensation is not lost.On the other hand,the losses suffered are the benchmark for determining the amount of compensation.What matters most is the value of the property,compensation for the profits not made,and other costs.As a rule,the value of property misappropriated or damaged because of internationally wrongful acts is determined based on its fair market value.Regarding special property,such as cultural property,the valuation is more difficult.The value of a company is de-termined based on its balance sheet on the difference between its assets and liabilities.82 Invasion of Azerbaijani Lands by Armenia and Heavy Consequences of Occupation Compensating for environmental damage has its own peculiarities.It’s necessary to compensate for reasonable spending by the injured state to eliminate environmental fallout or to compensate for the de-creased value of the property.Furthermore,point 15 of the commen-tary on article 36 notes that «environmental damage will often extend beyond that which can be readily quantified in terms of clean-up costs or property devaluation.Damage to such environmental values (biodi-versity,amenity,etc.—sometimes referred to as ‘non-use values’)is,as a matter of principle,no less real and compensable than damage to property,though it may be difficult to quantify.» The formation and development of international legal norms regarding compensation occurred during the activities of the UN Security Council and the UN Compensation Commission as they resolved the issue of Kuwait’s compensation for damages during the Iraqi invasion.Article 16 of Resolution 687,adopted by the UN Security Council on 3 April 1991,states that Iraq is liable under international law for any direct loss and damage,including environmental damage and the depletion of natural resources,as a result of Iraq’s unlawful invasion and occupation of Kuwait.According to the resolution,the UN Compensation Commission showed various kinds of damage that were «environmental damage and the depletion of natural resources.» The trend is therefore toward increased responsibility for environmental damage,and this situation displays the mutual interest among the states in less damage to the environment.According to article 37 of «Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts,» the state responsible for an internationally wrongful act is obligated to give satisfaction for the injury caused by that act,insofar as it can’t be made good by restitution or compensation.Satisfaction may consist of an acknowledgement of the breach,an expression of regret,a formal apology,or another appropriate gesture.It must be noted that in the case of satisfaction,material payments are also possible,and such payments are in the form of reparation for moral damages.Satisfaction concerning the Armenian-Azerbaijani conflict over Nagorno Karabakh may be in the form of admission by Armenia of the aggression against Azerbaijan,of the occupation of Azerbaijani territories,of committing the Khojali genocide as well as an official 83 Elkhan Suleymanov/Vurgun Suleymanov apology to the Azerbaijani people.Punishment of people who through their actions caused internationally wrongful acts can be another form of satisfaction.When determining reparation for internationally wrongful acts,the most difficult issues originate from assessing the amount of damages and defining the rules for such an assessment.These rules differ depending on the nature of violated commitments,assessment of the conduct of the sides,and other factors.Analysis of modern practice reveals that in many cases the injury to the state is calculated by assessing expenditures for undoing the damage dealt because of the occupation of the state’s territory,damage of property of the state,pollution of the environment,including border rivers,and so on.International practice also gives the right of the injured state to re-ceive payments on the principal sum of the reparation for the dam-ages it suffered because of internationally wrongful acts.According to article 38 of «Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts,» interest on any principal sum due is payable when necessary in order to ensure full reparation.As the document shows,the interest rate and mode of calculation is set to achieve that result.Additionally,interest runs from the date when the principal sum should have been paid until the date the obligation to pay is fulfilled.Thus,the injured state has the right to receive interest payments on the principal sum of the reparation for the damages it suffered.For example,the UN Compensation Commission was set up in 1991 to create a comprehensive solution of the issue of the damage to Kuwait because of the armed aggression by Iraq.The UN Com-pensation Commission board noted the following in its decision on the interest rate:«1.The winning side’s claim is to get an interest at the rate necessary to make up for the opportunity cost of the inability to use the principal of the compensation and for the period starting from the moment the damage was done.3.The interest is to be paid after the principal of the compensation is paid off.» Based on the 1,550,871 claims filed by various individuals,corpo-rations,and governments,the UN Compensation Commission board determined the damage dealt to Kuwait because of the armed aggres-sion by Iraq to be 52,467,108,060 US dollars.[81] The commission 84 Invasion of Azerbaijani Lands by Armenia and Heavy Consequences of Occupation reported that as of 28 October 2010,it had paid 30.7 billion dollars as compensation.[82] Azerbaijan has the right to receive compensation for material and moral damage because of the internationally wrongful acts of Ar-menia,and there are appropriate international legal mechanisms for this.The right of Azerbaijan to receive appropriate compensation for the damage it suffered has also been reflected in decisions of inter-national organizations.For example,article 4 of Resolution 2/11-C (IS),«On protecting holy Islamic sites,» adopted at the 11th Islamic Summit Conference (Session of Muslim Ummah in the 21st Centu-ry)in Dakar,Republic of Senegal,on 13-14 March 2008,states that OIC «believes that Azerbaijan has the right to receive compensation for the damage it suffered and confirms that Armenia is completely liable for the payment of this com-pensation.» Provisions with the same meanings have been reflected in other OIC documents as well.For instance,article 22 of Resolution 10/11-P (IS),«On the aggres-sion of the Republic of Armenia against the Azerbaijani Republic,» notes that OIC «believes that Azerbaijan has the right for appropriate compensation for the damage suffered and that the obligation to pay adequate compensation for these damages rests with Armenia.» Hence,it is clear that the problem of paying material and moral damages to Azerbaijan is an important aspect of tackling the conse-quences of Armenia’s aggression and of settling the Armenian-Azer-baijani conflict over Nagorno Karabakh.85 CONCLUSION We can draw the following conclusions by summing up the previ-ously described research and analyses.1.To realize its baseless territorial claims,Armenia carried out an armed invasion of Azerbaijan and occupied 20 percent of the Azerbaijani territory,including the former Nagorno Kara-bakh Autonomous Region and seven other districts.With its invasion of Azerbaijan,Armenia committed a crime against international peace.The crime of invasion is considered a crime against humanity,and for the armed invasion,Armenia bears international legal liability.2.During the armed invasion of Azerbaijan,Armenian armed forces killed more than twenty thousand people and wounded fifty thousand.Thousands of people went missing.Armenian forces carried out summary executions and mass killings of civilians,took people hostage,and used them for forced la-bor.Prisoners of war and hostages were subjected to torture and inhumane treatment,and the wounded and sick were de-nied medical aid.Consequently,during the aggression against Azerbaijan,Armenia blatantly violated international legal norms.3.On the night between 25 and 26 February 1992,Armenian armed forces committed the Khojali genocide.During the occu-pation of the town,613 civilian residents,including 63 children,106 women,and 70 elderly people,were killed with brutality 86 Invasion of Azerbaijani Lands by Armenia and Heavy Consequences of Occupation and torture.People had their heads cut and eyes gorged out,and pregnant women had their bellies stabbed with bayonets.During this horrible event,1,275 people were taken captive,150 people went missing,and 487 people were crippled.In this mass slaugh-ter,8 families were completely killed,25 children lost both par-ents,130 children lost one parent,and 56 people were tortured to death.The town of Khojali was destroyed—wiped off the face of the earth.The Khojali tragedy was preplanned by the official state bodies of Armenia and aimed at complete or partial killing of the ethnic Azerbaijani residents of the town.These crimes belong to the category of crimes against humanity as genocide.4.The 250,000 ethnic Azerbaijanis who lived in Armenia prior to the armed invasion of Azerbaijan were deported from their historical lands and settled in Azerbaijan as refugees.Arme-nia carried out ethnic cleansing on the territories it occupied and turned them into a monoethnic zone.From the occupied territories,more than 760,000 Azerbaijanis were expelled and became IDPs.As a result,more than one million Azerbaijan-is were expelled from their homes and became refugees and IDPs.People falling into this category were temporarily set-tled in sixty-two towns and districts of Azerbaijan.Thus,the deportation of the ethnic Azerbaijanis from Armenia and the Armenian armed invasion of Azerbaijan were accompanied by gross and mass violations of human rights,and an emergency humanitarian situation took place in Azerbaijan.5.As a result of the armed invasion and occupation,Azerbaijan suffered great material losses.In the occupied Azerbaijani ter-ritories,more than 900 settlements,about 150,000 buildings with an overall area of 9.1 million square meters,4,366 social and cultural facilities,7,000 public facilities,2,389 industrial and agricultural facilities,1,025 schools,855 nurseries,4 sani-tariums,798 clinics,927 libraries,1,510 cultural facilities,598 communications facilities,and other properties were destroyed.Because of the invasion,many national cultural monuments of the Azerbaijani people were destroyed,and unprecedented damage was 87 Elkhan Suleymanov/Vurgun Suleymanov done to the cultural heritage.Irreparable environmental damage was inflicted in the occupied territories of Azerbaijan; several very rare plants were decimated,cultivable land was rendered useless,and natural resources were illegally exploited and plundered.Azerbaijan suffered much damage because of the armed invasion.According to preliminary studies,the amount of material damage due to the invasion stood at 431.536 billion US dollars as of the beginning of 2011 and will continue to increase until the invasion is over.According to the international legal norms and practice for set-tling international armed conflicts,the invader pays reparation to the victim of invasion.Therefore,ending the occupation of the Azer-baijani territories and payment of reparation for the damage dealt to Azerbaijan by Armenia are topical issues.6.UN Security Council Resolutions 822 (1993),853 (1993),874 (1993),and 884 (1993); the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe Resolution 1416 (2005); the European Parliament Resolution «On a European Union strategy in the South Caucasus»; the Organization of the Islamic Conference (now Organization of Islamic Cooperation); OSCE; and other international organizations in numerous documents have con-firmed that the Azerbaijani territories were occupied,over one million Azerbaijani citizens became refugees,and a humani-tarian emergency emerged in Azerbaijan.In the documents of international organizations,the territorial integrity of Azerbai-jan within its internationally recognized borders was support-ed.In addition,the unconditional withdrawal of the Armenian armed forces from the occupied Nagorno Karabakh region of Azerbaijan and other districts as well as the exercising of the right of the refugees and IDPs to return to their motherland and to live safely was demanded.The international community has adopted various documents on the conflict,but has not done any practical work to implement the points in these documents.No sanctions have been imposed or pressure applied against Armenia.No difference was noted between the aggressor,which 88 Invasion of Azerbaijani Lands by Armenia and Heavy Consequences of Occupation is Armenia,and Azerbaijan,the victim of invasion.In addition,in many cases,international organizations prefer not to make state-ments like «the occupation of the Azerbaijani territory by Armenia» and «over one million Azerbaijanis have become refugees and IDPs because of the invasion and the ethnic cleansing policy of Armenia.» Undoubtedly,there is great concern among Azerbaijani citizens that the international community displays such indifference to the liberation of the occupied territories,to state sovereignty within the internationally recognized borders of Azerbaijan,to restoration of the rights of refugees and IDPs,and to the exercise of their right to return to their native land and safely live there.And their concern continues to grow.Why does the international community not want to impose sanctions against Armenia? Why does it ignore the crimes of invasion and ethnic cleansing carried out by Armenia? Why does the international commu-nity not demand unconditional withdrawal from the occupied territories in compliance with the imperative principles of international law and use the mechanisms specified for this purpose in the UN Charter,but instead calls for mutual give-and-take within the framework of negotia-tions between the Azerbaijani and Armenian presidents mediated by the OSCE Minsk Group? Had Azerbaijan occupied Armenia’s territories,would the international community treat Azerbaijan in the same way as it now does Armenia? The Azerbaijani public poses questions like these and seeks objective answers to them.It is possible that the reason the international community displays such an indifference to the armed invasion of Armenia,to its continued occupation of the Azerbaijani territories,and to mass and gross viola-tions of the rights of hundreds of thousands of citizens of Azerbaijan is that the aggressor,Armenia,is a Christian state and the victim of ag-gression,Azerbaijan,is a Muslim one.This opinion is currently gaining strength among the Azerbaijani public,and supporters of this opinion are growing in numbers.Such an attitude leads to the erosion of the confidence and trust of the Azerbaijani public in the international com-munity,especially developed Western countries.Therefore,the international community must take practical steps to eliminate the invasion,return the refugees and forced migrants to their lands,ensure their rights to live in security,and remove double standards.89 Elkhan
