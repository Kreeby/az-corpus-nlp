Azerbaijani Cuisine Ministry of Culture and Tourism Republic of Azerbaijan Azerbaijani Cuisine (A Collection of Reci pes of Azerbaijani Meals,Snacks and Drinks)The editors would like to thank:The Azerbaijan National Culinary Center,the Ministry of National Security,Copyright Agency,National Academy of Sci-ences of Azerbaijan,Baku State University,Azerbaijan State Economic University,Baku Slavic University and Azerbaijan University of Languages for their support and assistance in the collection of materials ,archives and other documents."Azerbaijani cuisine." Cookbook of Azerbaijani meals,snacks and drinks.152 pages.ISBN-978-9952-486-00-1 «INDIGO» print house The history of Azerbaijani cuisine dates back thousands of years.Accurate cuts of meat of be-zoar goats,used to this day for culinary purposes,are depicted in ancient petroglyph of Gobustan,the age of which are estimated by various scien-tists to be from 12 to 40 thousand years old.These paintings repeatedly indicate that in ancient times people were taught how to cook meals from various parts of the animal,going so far as to specifying the exact fragments of the meat used to prepare specific dishes.One of the turning points in the culinary his-tory of human civilization,the œsamovarB (tea kettle)was the first successful experience of mankind’s attempt to change the taste of liquid and broth through the balanced impact of water and air.One of the most ancient of these samovars was found during excavations in the city of Sheki,and is estimated to be about 3700 years old.A specimen of the world’s oldest butter,over 2,200 years old,can be found in the Ismailli region museum of local history,while the oldest butter churns,found in Nakhchivan and Agstafa regions,are dated to be more than 5000 years old.In the Shamakhi museum of ethnography and local history,fossils of wines aged 2400 years compliment one of the oldest distillery ma-chines of the VII-VIII centuries.Made from clay,these machines were designed for alcohol and aromatic ether oils and can be found in the Museum of Local History in Gabala.These ex-hibits illustrate the developmental process of ob-taining alcoholic beverages and essential oils for medicine and food.Azerbaijani cuisine arouse admiration of many notable historical figures including:the popular French writer and chef of the XIX cen-tury,Alexandre Dumas; the famous Italian trav-eler Marco Polo; the Venetian di plomat of the XV century Ambrosio Contarini; the German di plomat of the XVII century Adam Olearius,and XVIII century Turkish traveler Evliya Chelebi.The dishes belonging to Azerbaijani cui-sine were the subjects of culinary desires in XII-XIX centuries of such travelers as Abu Hamid al-Garnati of Granada (Spain),Abu Dulafa,Yakut al-Hamawi and Hamdallaha Qazwini from the Orient; Thomas Bannister,Jeffrey Deckett and Anthony Jenkinson from England; famous Russian researchers Varvara Bakunin,Fedor Korff,Ilya Berezin,and many others.Samples of Azerbaijani cuisine were even served to Russian tsars in the XV-XVI centuries (katlama,lavashana,etc).The great Azerbaijani culinary master Shirvan,who served as head chef and chief physician at the court of the Ottoman Sultan in the XV century,wrote an immense cookbook that has had a huge impact on Turkish cuisine.In search of culinary masterpieces from the Orient,British Prime Minister Winston Churchill received the Azerbaijani reci pe for dovga,and be-fore his election as U.S.president Sen.Barack Obama received the famous Azerbaijani reci pe for rose petal jam.The variety and flavours of Azerbaijani cui-sine also deeply impressed the partici pants of the œEurovision $ 2012B song contest held in Baku.It presented itself as the perfect culinary decora-tion of this European music festival.The famous Turkish chef Nedim Atilla,who visited Azer-baijan during the musical competition,expressed his admiration for our cooking in the Turkish newspaper œAksamB (from 10/02/2012).œThe various Azerbaijani main courses of plov,sarma,dolma,khash,bozbash,and chigirtma offer such exquisite choices… It is said that there are more than 30 varieties of dolma,and 100 varieties of plov.My duty is to tell you about the plovs I tried $ they are just fabulous.B Azerbaijani cuisine is abundant in meat,dairy products,poultry and fish as well as plant-based foods (vegetables,herbs,roots,grains).It is in-teresting to note that the abundance of salt in Azerbaijani cuisine owes itself to the mines of Nakhchivan and the lakes of the Absheron Peninsula.It is also noteworthy that spice is used spar-ingly in our cuisine,as the basic approach of Azerbaijani cooking is to preserve the natural taste of foodstuffs,which are so delicious by themselves,they do not need to be replaced with the taste of additional ingredients.Spices should emphasize the flavours of the product,amplify it,and not drown it.This feature of our meat products even spawned such epithets as "chichek kimi",which in the Azerbaijani language means "fragrant as a flower." Just as the French and Italian cuisines in Eu-rope,Azerbaijani cuisine generously enriched the cuisine of its neighboring nations.Azerbaijani cuisine is consistently borrowed and adapted by neighboring nations,has a special place in their diet,and after a time comes to be represented as their own.At present there are more than three thousand recorded reci pes and products,created in different regions of Azerbaijan.Therefore,the process of studying the history of the origin of our nation’s food reci pes is a permanent process.The historical,cultural and gastronomical value of Azerbaijani cuisine is unquestionable.We could provide an ample amount of hard ev-idence of this,but we do not want to bore the reader with numerous examples.This book presents only a small part of Azer-baijani cuisine,dishes that can be prepared even by the novice cook We hope that these reci pes will bring happi-ness and health to you and your family at home.So,bon appetite!

Onions-70 g Chickpeas-100 g Chestnuts-150g Albuhara (Dried Plum)-100 g Saffron-20 ml Salt,pepper,sumac-to taste Delicious,aromatic and nutritious,piti is cooked only in a chanag or a kyup (Turkic-a clay pot).For this reason,the dish is sometimes called chanag (clay pot).The recipe of piti has long ago crossed the Turkic frontiers.Its variants can now be seen in the Balkans,Ukraine,Moldova,Georgia and the countries of the Mediterranean Sea where it is known as chanakh or chanakhi and other various names.In Azerbaijan however,this dish is also simply known as piti.The etymology of the name of this dish comes from the Turkic word bitdi (in some dialects bitti),which means the end of the meal.A serving of this dish is so hearty that after the meal it is common to say "Bitdi”,signifying no further need for extra food.To prepare piti,the mutton (or veal)should be cut to medium sized pieces,and put into the chanag.Add a peeled or finely chopped onion along with pre-soaked chickpeas.Next,pour in 4 cups of water.The mixture shouldn’t be salted or peppered and the broth should be transparent.Put the piti first on high heat for a few times and remove the forming foam.After reducing the heat,cover the pot tightly and brew for 3 to 4 hours.30 minutes before the piti is finished cooking,add peeled chestnuts,dried plum and infusion of saffron (for 1 gram of saffron use 3 tablespoons of boiling water).Piti is usually eaten from a kyasa (deep bowl).It is actually two dishes made in one.Firstly,on the bottom of the kyasa,sprinkle salt,pepper and sumac to taste.Add crumbled bread and after-wards pour in the broth.This makes a hearty soup.Secondly,the contents leftover in the pot are then put into a deep dish with salt,pepper and sumac to taste,and there you have your second dish.Parcha-Bozbash Lamb or Beef (Brisket or Shoulder)-600 g Butter-60 g Chestnuts-100 g Fresh Quince-120 g or Dried-40 g Chickpeas-100 g Potatoes-300 g Onions-80

boil the meat and chickpeas together.Remov-ing the forming foam,add a finely chopped onion.After-wards,boil the peeled chestnuts and sliced quince in salted water and add it to the meat mixture along with the saffron infusion (for 1 gram of saffron use 3 tablespoons of boiling water).The dish is served with sprinkled,dried chopped mint.Peeled onions,sumac,fresh vegetables and pickled vegeta-bles are served separately with the dish.6 Azerbaijani Cuisine Kyufta-bozbash (Bozbash of Large Meatballs)Lamb (Boneless)-600 g Butter-60 g Rice (Arborio)-60 g Chickpeas-100 g Onions-80 g Fresh

meat-grinder.Add salt,pepper,dried mint and rice.Mix well and form balls big enough for 1-2 servings.Stuff 2 to 3 pieces of the washed and dried cherry-plum into the middle of each meatball.If any dried fruits are left over,you can add them into the soup later on.If you have bones,you can use them to make a soup,adding boiled chickpeas and half-cut potatoes.If you do not have bones or want a lighter meal,all the ingredients can be poured into roughly 1.5 liters of boiling water.Cook the mixture for 20-30 minutes or until the potatoes are ready.When taking the soup off the heat sprinkle with chopped dried mint.Serve with fresh herbs and pickled products.Sumac can be served separately and added to taste.This dish can also be prepared with veal or turkey meat.Azerbaijani Cuisine 7

After it's cooked this dish can be refrigerated for 2-3 days and can be served as a cold appetizer or in a heated state.It can be served with or without broth.After washing the meat and removing the film,cut it into large chunks and place in a kazan (large pan).Add enough water so that it covers the meat and bring it to a boil.Remove the foam that forms and cook for 1.5 hours until tender.The broth should be boiled down by half at the end of cooking.Peel and finely chop the onion along with the sheep’s tail fat and coriander.Remove the meat from the pan and strain the broth.Pour the broth and meat back into the pan,and add the onions and sheep tail fat.Add salt and pepper to taste.Simmer on low heat for 20 minutes.Remove from heat and add the chopped coriander.First,preheat the oven well.Proceed to rub the lamb with salt,inside and out,and fill the belly with slices of quince or apples.Sow the abdomen shut.Then,rub the outside of the lamb with vegetable oil and turmeric or plum extract.Lay the lamb on an oven pan,and add 4 cups of water.Bake for 7 hours at 180˚C.Serve whole.Alternatively,the lamb can also be wrapped in foil and braised for 6 hours.Make sure to let it brown.Lamb (with Bones)-600 g Onions-220 g Sheep Tail Fat-100 g Coriander-50 g Salt and Pepper-to taste 10 Azerbaijani Cuisine Boughlama Lamb (Hip)-600 g Small Beans-100 g Pumpkin-600 g Oil-60 g Onions-600 g Dried Cherry-Plums-230 g Sugar-10 g Coriander and Dill – 30 g each Cinnamon-1 g Salt and Pepper-to taste The word boughlama comes from the word "bough" (steam).The dish’s name translates from Turkic languages as “cooked in its own steam.” For this dish the meat is cut into pieces of 30-40 grams,salted and fried.Add chopped onion,water (broth),and pre-soaked cherry-plums and let cook in its own steam.Soak the small beans separately and cook until soft.Drain the beans and add them to the meat.Cut the pumpkin into pieces weighing 30-40 g,and add to the meat and beans.Sprinkle with a little sugar and cook until ready with the lid closed for 20-30 minutes.When serving,sprinkle with chopped herbs.Serve pepper and cinnamon separately.Azerbaijani Cuisine 11 Arzuman Kyuftasi Boneless Chicken-400 g Lamb or Beef-1 kg (Tenderloin)Onions-300 g Rice (Arborio)-50 g Dried Cherry-Plums or Albuhara-100 g 2 Chicken Eggs or 10 Quail eggs Chickpeas-100 g Sumac-5 g Dill-1 bunch Salt and Pepper-to taste The word arzuman derives from the Turkic word "Azman," which translates into "huge" or "enormous." This is fitting as the meatballs are larger than nor-mal and are made to feed the whole family.In addition,this is a celebratory dish.In Azerbaijan,this dish is most common in the Nakhchivan region.To prepare this dish,boil the eggs,cool them,and peel them (the chicken eggs should be cut in half,the quail eggs can be left whole).Soak the chickpeas for 8-10 hours in hot water and then boil in lightly salted water.Pass the meat and onions through a mincing machine (it’s recommended you do this twice)to make minced meat.Add washed rice,salt and pepper to taste,and mix well.Use all of the minced meat mixture to form one large meatball and place on a spread out piece of sterile gauze (30x30 cm).Make a pocket in the middle of the meatball for the turkey or chicken breast.Stuff various parts of the meatball with dried plums,or albuharu,and the eggs.Form the meatball again (it’s recommended to make it slightly elongated)and wrap it in the gauze.Place everything into a large pot,taking care not to alter the form of the meatball.Pour in the boiled chickpeas with the water in which it was cooked in,and add enough water to cover ¾ ths of the meatball.Cover with a lid and cook for an hour on low heat.Add salt to taste.Some of the water should evaporate but remain covering half the meatball (if the water boils away in the cooking process,add more).Serve as follows:put the meatball on a separate dish.Cut,it in half and sprinkle with chopped dill.Pour the broth in which the meatball was cooked in with the chickpeas into a bowl and serve separately.Sumac can be added to taste.You can serve the sliced meatballs in the bowl of broth,or separately on a plate.This beautiful,unusual,tasty,and filling dish is usually made for a large family or for a festive table.12 Azerbaijani Cuisine Reza Kyufta Lamb or Beef (Boneless)-600 g Onions-400 g Quince-150 g (in Season)Tomatoes-200 g Butter-70 g Turmeric-1 g Salt and Pepper-to taste Put the meat with two onions through a mincing machine.Add salt and pepper to taste,sprinkle some turmeric and mix well.Chop finely,or in rings,three onions and sauté in butter for 10 minutes in a pan.Afterwards,pour 2 cups of water into the pan and bring to a boil.Next,make meatballs roughly the size of walnuts from your minced meat mixture.Put them in the pan,and season with grated tomatoes.Cover and keep on low heat.After 30 minutes add sliced quince and cook until done.Add salt and pepper to taste.Azerbaijani Cuisine 13 Bozartma Lamb or Veal (Brisket,Ribs)-1 kg Butter-100 g Onions-200 g Herbs (Cilantro,Dill,Mint)– 1 bunch each Lemon-1 pc.Cucumbers-200 g Thyme-20 g Potatoes-300 g Dried Cherry-Plums or Plums-100 g Salt and Pepper-to taste In Turkic languages the word bozartma translates as “meat driven to the graying color when boiled." The verb bozartmag,which is in the name of this dish,has the root of boz,which is linked to the orig-inal translation of "the change in color of boiled meat." To prepare this dish,cut the meat into small pieces (4-5 pieces per serving)and finely chop the onion.Place them in a pan with butter and stir fry until pink.Pour 3 cups of water and add the cherry-plum or plum and simmer until tender.Add salt and pepper to taste.The water should evaporate and leave a thick sauce.Cut the potato in half,and add it to the pan.Sprinkle with thyme and cook until the potatoes become tender.Serve the dish by pouring the sauce in which it was cooked in over the finished product.The sarimsagli-gatig sauce (yogurt with garlic)is placed separately along with fresh cucumbers cut into 4 pieces.It’s also common to decorate the top of this dish with slices of lemon.Bozartma can also be prepared using chicken.In this case,the dish is called chicken bozartma,and in some places,chicken bozbash.14 Azerbaijani Cuisine Taskabab Lamb or Beef-1 kg Onions-400 g Turmeric-3 g or Thyme-10 g Sumac-to taste or Pomegranate-1 pc.Salt and pepper-to taste The word tas in the name of this dish refers to a large copper cookware,which is deeper than a pan.To prepare this dish,first cut the meat into small pieces.Slice the onion into wide rings,mix with sumac and salt,and layer into a pan.Pour in 1 cup of water.If the water boils away,add more.Without stirring,simmer on low heat until the meat is cooked.After the meat has finished cooking,sprinkle on some turmeric or thyme.For the sauce,you can use the thick liquid left over from the meat and onions on the bottom of the pan.Next,peel a fresh pome-granate,and sprinkle the finished product with pomegranate seeds.The dish can be served sepa-rately or as a garnish to plov.Azerbaijani Cuisine 15 Dolma Yarpag dolma Lamb (Medium Fat Content)or Beef-500 g Onions-150 g Cilantro,Dill,Mint-1 beam (If there is no Fresh Mint,use Dried)Sprig of Basil Rice (Arborio)-100 g Grape Vine Leaves (Fresh or Pickled)-200 g Sarimsagli Gatig (Yogurt with Garlic)or Gatig (Plain Yogurt)Salt,Pepper,Cinnamon-to taste Put the meat through a mincing machine with the onion,and add washed rice and finely chopped herbs.Add salt and pepper.Make sure everything is mixed thoroughly.If you have fresh grape leaves,(one of the meanings of yarpag in the Turkic lan-guage group is “leaf”)scald them with boiling water until tender.Pickled or salted leaves are ready for cooking.Wrap the minced meat mixture with the grape leaves,similar to the shape of an envelope,and tightly pack them into a pot.To make sure the leaves are packed tight and don’t unwrap while cooking,you can cover them in the pot with an in-verted plate.Add two cups of water,and cover with a lid.Cook on low heat for one hour until ready.If the water boils away,add another half a cup.To make sure the leaves on the bottom of the pan don’t burn,place a layer of bones (you can use ribs)or a layer of vine leaves.Dolma is served in a bowl,sprinkled with the juice in which it was cooked in and is usually eaten with gatig (plain yogurt),to which you can also add finely chopped garlic.When harvesting grape leaves for dolma:wrap the fresh leaves separately in paper and put them in a plastic bag or cellophane wrap in the freezer.Thaw and wash before use and afterwards drench in boiling water.Use young,thin and smooth leaves.Instead of grape leaves you can also use young mulberry,quince,sorrel,and wild grapes leaves.This however,gives the dish a different taste.Azerbaijani Cuisine 17 As ancient as the Turkic world,dolma can un-questionably be described as a culinary monu-ment in ethnic Turkic cuisine.This dish has had a strong impact on the cultures of various ethnici-ties,many of whom consider it their national dish.The Azerbaijani verb dolamag means "to be wrapped/wrapping," and has a direct relationship to the dish dolma,where meat is wrapped in leaves.A synonym of the verb is the word sarimag,depending on the region the dolma is from,can also be called sarma.In Turkic lan-guages dolma also means "filled up" while sarma means-"wrapped up." In Azerbaijan,dolma is primarily made from grape leaves.However leaves of certain herbs,vegetables,fruits and other trees are also used.Vegetables like tomatoes,eggplants,zucchinis,bell peppers,cucumbers,onions,and fruits like apples are also widely used to fill with meat.As for the leaves themselves-grapes,quince,lime,hornbeam tree,and cabbage leaves are all uti-lized in the making of this diverse dish.In addi-tion,different regions prepare the stuffing in various ways,adding herbs,tomatoes,dried mint,nuts,raisins,lemon juice,and various spices.(Dolma with Vine Leaves)Lamb or Beef (Boneless)-800 g Cabbage-1 kg Rice (Arborio)-100 g Onions-120 g Tomatoes-150 g or Tomato Paste-40 g Cilantro-1 bunch Wine Vinegar-40 g or Citric Acid-20 g Sugar-20 g or Mulberry Doshab-60 g

thoroughly.Blanch the cabbage in water and peel the leaves (three pieces per serving).Wrap the prepared minced meat stuffing,giving each leaf a square shape.Dolma should be spread in rows in the pan.Fill the pan to the top with water and cook for an hour.20 minutes before the dolma is cooked,pour in the sirke-shire sauce,which you can make from sugar and vinegar.When serving,sprinkle with the juices in which the dolma was cooked in along with some cinnamon.Serve the gatig (plain yogurt)or sarimsagli gatig sauce (yogurt with crushed garlic)separately,to be poured on top.18 Azerbaijani

cinnamon.Serve the gatig (plain yogurt)or sarimsagli gatig sauce (yogurt with crushed garlic)separately,to be poured on top.Azerbaijani Cuisine 19 Lamb,Beef or Veal-1 kg Onions-200 g Eggplant (Medium Size),Tomato and Sweet Pepper (Thin-skinned)-400 g Reyhan (Purple Basil)-1 bunch Cilantro-1 bunch Turmeric-5 g Salt and Pepper-to taste This dish is often called "Uch Baji" ("three sisters" in Azerbaijani),and refers to the number of main ingredients:tomatoes,peppers and eggplants.To prepare the eggplant,first crop the stalk and make a short longitudinal incision.Now soak it in boiling water,and let cool.For the tomatoes,slice the top of and remove a third of the pulp with a teaspoon.Finally the pepper should be sliced along the lid and removed of seeds.Mix salt and turmeric separately in a saucer.Mince the meat with the onions and fry them in butter,stirring constantly (be careful not to overcook,the meat should remain juicy).Then,add chopped basil,cilantro and tomato pulp.Mix lightly with salt and pepper.Coat the inside of the pepper,eggplant and tomato with the mixture of turmeric and salt made separately in a saucer,and fill each of them with the minced meat mixture.Put in a wide deep pan in one layer,and pour in half a cup of water.Cover with a lid and cook until the liquid evaporates.When serving,place one of each of the tomato,pepper and eggplant and pour over any remaining liquid.You can serve the dish with sarimsagli gatig (yogurt with garlic),or simply gatig (plain yogurt).The eggplants,peppers and tomatoes can be cooked together or separately.20 Azerbaijani Cuisine Badimjan,Pomidor,Biber Dolma (Dolma from Eggplants,Tomatoes and Peppers,Assorted)Azerbaijani Cuisine 21 Meat on Skewers (Kababs)The word shish in Azerbaijani translates as “skewer.” The word shishlik comes from the adjective,and is formed with the possessive "lik" in the end.Owing to this,the word shishlik comes to signify meat intended for stringing on metal skewers,to be cooked on burning coals,without flame.A more common and famous name for this dish is kabab.In Azerbaijan this deli-cious dish is served to quickly satisfy hungry guests.Traditionally the preparation of kabab is,and always has been,considered a male occupation.It is a symbol of a man’s hospitality.In a short time (some kebab masters manage to do so in only an hour)the cook has to kill a sheep (lamb),cut the carcass,make bastirma,build a fire,look after the coals to make sure there is no flame,string dozens of meat skewers,roast the meat,garnish it,and serve it in a presentable way.Kababs are made from various different products,including lamb,veal,goat,poultry,fish,and vegetables.A wide variety of sauces,condiments,and baked goods are served with the meal.The meat is roasted on a mangal (Turkic grill).The most important element of the term "gal" is its derivation from the verb galamag (to make and support a fire,collecting the glow-ing embers into a pile).Experienced craftsmen,called kababchi,utilize many ancient culinary secrets.First,the meat must be extremely fresh; and secondly,unsalted and fatty cuts from different parts of the car-cass must be prepared separately.Third,the heat from the coals should not be too strong; otherwise the meat is charred on the outside,but will remain too rare on the inside.Typically,kebab meat is most delicious when made from a female animal.And most importantly of all:shishlik should be prepared when one is in the best of moods! Azerbaijani Cuisine 23 Lamb (Loin or Hip Part)-1.3 kg Onions-250 g Tomatoes-400 g Parsley and Basil-40 g Scallion-150 g Sumac-10 g or Narsharab-20 g Pepper,Salt-to taste To make delicious tika-kabab,which literally trans-lates as “kabab of pieces,” cut the meat into pieces weighting between 50 and 60 grams (3-4 slices per serving).Rub with salt and pepper,string on a skewer,and grill over hot charcoals,making sure there is no open flame.Onions and scallions are usually served as a garnish to the kabab.Narsharab,sumac,salt and pepper can be served separately on the side,and the kabab is sprinkled with chopped fresh herbs.When serving kabab in the summer,tomatoes,eggplants,peppers and potatoes can similarly be roasted on a skewer and served as a side.24 Azerbaijani Cuisine Tika-Kabab (Skewers of Meat Pieces)Ich Kabab (Skewers of Offal)Liver,Lungs,Kidneys,and Intestines of One Sheep Sheep’s Tail Fat-60 g Parsley-One Bunch Sumac-2 g Pepper,Salt-to taste The word ich translated from Turkic languages means "insides." Natu-rally,this kabab is made from sheep innards (liver,lungs,kidneys,and thor-oughly cleaned intestines).After cleaning the innards,cut them into cubes weighing 30-40 g.Add salt and pepper.Next,cut the fat (sheep’s tail fat)into parts weighing roughly 10 g and string them on the skewer between the pieces of chopped liver.Watch out for flaming coals,usually as a result of dripping fat,as the open flame will burn the innards.To prevent this,sprinkle lightly salted water on the coals whenever and wherever you see open flames.When serving,garnish with chopped herbs or parsley and sumac.Azerbaijani Cuisine 25 Lamb-2 kg Onion-1 kg Vinegar-50g Thyme-10 g Salt and Pepper-to taste 26 Azerbaijani Cuisine Basturma Kabab (Skewers of Marinated Lamb)The word basturma has a Turkic origin and one of the meanings of the word basturmag means "to flavor",i.e.the process of flavoring or marinating (with vinegar,thyme,salt,pepper,onion)and keeping the meat in a tightly lidded saucepan.The second meaning of the word translates as “to press,” “to press down,” or “pressed.” To prepare this meal,first split the meat into pieces (4x4 cm).Finely chop the onion and mix with the meat.Salt and pepper to taste.When making the marinade,as specified above,add some diced sheep’s tail fat (from the rump)diced into cubes of 4x4 cm.Add the marinade to the meat,and put everything into an enamel bowl.Press down firmly to soften the meat and help it absorb the flavor of the onions.Afterwards,let sit in a cool place for 24hours.When stringing the meat on a skewer,make sure no onions remain.Place the skewers on a grill,and continuously rotate them so that the meat is cooked evenly.Be attentive as the meat is tender and cooks very quickly.As for the cubes of marinated sheep’s tail fat,prepare them on a separate skewer as the time of cooking is different.The fat should turn rosy when ready,similar to the color of fried potatoes.This aspect of the dish is also used in other varieties of kabab.Basturma kabab is usually served with sumac,fresh herbs,salad greens,tomatoes and chopped onions.Veal (Tenderloin)-2 kg Onions-250 g Vinegar-50g Thyme-10 g Salt and Pepper-to taste Dana basturma is the same as basturma,except made with veal.For this dish,the veal is cut into portions one cen-timeter thick.Finely chop the onion and add it to the prepared meat.Add thyme,salt and pepper and mix well.Cover and marinate in a cool place for 24 hours.When stringing together on a skewer make sure no onions are left on the meat,as it will burn quicker than the meat.Grill until meat is done.Azerbaijani Cuisine 27 Dana Basturma (Skewers of Marinated Veal)Lyula Kabab Lamb-1.3 kg Sheep’s Tail Fat-100 g Onions-250 g Scallions-150 g Sumac-20 g Salt and Pepper-to taste The name of this dish comes from the word lyula,which signifies a barrel or twisted object having a longitudinal hole in the middle.In ancient times paper wrapped in a roll,or a scroll,was also called lyula.First,mince the lamb meat,tail fat and onion two times through.Then add salt and pepper,and place in a cool place for 30 minutes.Wet your hands in salted water,and mold the meat on a skewer in the shapes of sausages.Put on the mangal,or grill,and cook for 10-15 minutes,constantly rotating the skewer.This form of kabab is served with lavash (thin pita bread),churek (bread),and with fresh herbs and onions.It is also sprinkled with sumac.Lyula kabab can also be made from beef,turkey,and fish (sturgeon family),but 300g of sheep’s tail fat for every 1.5 kg of meat must be added to the mixture.The method of preparation is the same.28 Azerbaijani Cuisine Lyula Kabab from Potatoes Potatoes-2 kg Eggs – 2 pcs Butter-120 g Onions-80 g Butter-40 g Sheep’s Tail Fat-200 g Salt and Pepper-to taste Wash and boil the potatoes in their skins.Peel,chop and mash the potatoes.Fry the onions and eggs in butter and mix in thoroughly with the mashed potatoes.Add salt and pepper.When placing on the skewers,form the potatoes into small sausage-like shapes and put them on the hot mangal.Grill on both sides for 3-5 minutes.Tursh Kabab In the Turkic language group the word tursh means "sour." The dish’s name comes from the sour taste the abgora gives it.To start,divide the meat into two parts.Cut one part into small pieces and boil in a small amount of water,and mince the other part.Mince the onion,garlic and parsley as well.Take half of this mixture and add it into the pot in which the meat is cooking.Add the second part of the mixture to the ground beef.Add pepper and salt,and mix thor-oughly.Form small meatballs from the minced meat and gently place them into the pot where the other meat is cooking.Pour in half a cup of abgora (the juice of unripe grapes)and if necessary add a little water.Cook on low heat until the meat is tender.You can replace the abgora with two lemons.In the summer,you can also add fried eggplants to the already cooked tursh kabab.Tursh kabab is often served with plov.Lamb-800 g Onions-300 g Parsley-6 beams Green garlic-100 g Abgora (The Juice of Unripe Grapes)-100 g Butter-200 g Eggplant-400 g Salt and Pepper-to taste Azerbaijani Cuisine 29 Gabirgha Kebab Lamb Ribs-2 kg Pepper,Salt-to taste Gabirga kabab in Turkic languages means "skewers of lamb ribs."

fragrant,delicate and amazingly delicious dish called plov.It is an integral part of Azerbaijani hospitality and the main dish of its national cuisine.It’s no wonder that among the people it is known as the crown,or “Shah,” of Azerbaijani cuisine,with people going insofar as calling it "ash," the word for food.The word ash in Turkic languages not only means food,but also "to cook" or "cooking." Ancient written sources,including the Orkhon-Yenisey monuments of the VII-XI centuries,and the famous Turkic epic "Kitabi Dede Gorgud," describe all dishes having been cooked in cone-shaped copper cauldrons as “ash”.Furthermore,the skilled chef who could feed a large number of people at once was called an ashchi.The names of many dishes come from the word ash,including khashil,khash,khamirashy,and lavash (a thin,flat bread)as well as gashyg (which means spoon).There are many different variations of plov in Eastern cuisine,ranging from complex dishes prepared by seasoned cooks to simple ones that even a bachelor will find easy to make.Even vegetarians and those following a strict diet can find the perfect variation of plov that fits their needs.Each nation has its own preference of plov set apart not only by taste,but also by the method of preparation.In Azerbaijani cuisine,where there are hundreds of different types of plov rice and side dishes,are mostly cooked separately so that the guest himself can choose what flavor combinations suit him best,and which of the "side dishes" appeal to him.In ancient times plov was traditionally eaten is only the hands,using four fingers.It is believed that in addition to taste,vision and smell,touching the meal itself greatly increases the feeling of pleasure from this amazing dish.For the preparation of almost all the variations of plov you would traditionally need a kazan (a large trapezoidal cauldron which becomes narrow towards the top),a medium-sized saucepan for the garnish (size also depends on the kind of plov being prepared),a small pot for heating oil/butter and other purposes,and a basin-shaped strainer for the rice.Syuzma Plov (Strained Rice)Rice (Arborio)-600 g Melted Butter-50-100 g Saffron-0.2 g Cumin-2 g Salt-to taste The name syuzma comes from the Turkic word for "strained." This is the pri-mary method used for the preparation of the rice.First,the saffron must be infused in a cup with one tablespoon of boiling water.The rice should be soaked in salted water the evening before you start cooking.Make sure you rinse it with cold water prior to beginning the cooking process.To cook the rice,put it in boiling salted water and cook for 5-7 minutes until soft.Next,you need to strain the rice to make sure it doesn’t stick together.When cooking plov you will need to make sure the rice does not burn on the bottom.To do this you will need to make something called gazmag (a type of crispy crust),which will cover the bottom of the kazan (pot)you will cook your plov in.Gazmag is very delicious and simultaneously prevents the rice from burning.There are two methods for making gazmag:• After adding half a tablespoon of oil to the bottom of the kazan,knead the dough as you usually would (using flour,water,an egg,and some salt),roll it out so it is about 3 mm thick and place it on the bottom of the pot.• Clean several medium-sized potatoes and slice them into circles 0.5 cm in thickness.In the kazan,add oil/butter and put on heat.Now form a layer of sliced potatoes on the bottom of the pot,making sure to add salt to taste be-forehand.Next,gently slide the rice into the kazan,taking care not to shake it or ram it into the sides.Sprinkle the rice with the saffron infusion (for 1 gram of saffron use 3 tablespoons of boiling water)and cumin,and cover tightly with a lid wrapped in a cotton cloth.Place a frying pan or iron baking sheet under the pot and simmer over low heat for 40 minutes.The rice is ready when it begins to separate and develops an amazing aroma.Next,pore the rice over with melted butter and let it sit on the heat for an-other 10-15 minutes.When ready,slide the plov onto an oval dish (in Azerbaijan this special dish is called a bulud)and take the gazmag out from the bottom of the pan.You can place it on a separate plate,or serve it on or around the rice.Azerbaijani Cuisine 51 Cut the meat into medium sized pieces and boil them.Add salt and pepper to taste and wrap them in cheesecloth.Then,finely chop the fennel.Pre-cook the broad beans in water until they become tender.In-fuse the saffron (for 1 gram of saffron use 3 tablespoons of boiling water).Soak the rice in salted water,rinse,and put in boiling water,cooking for 5-7 minutes until soft.3 minutes before the rice is ready,add the fennel and pre-cooked beans.Strain when ready.Make gazmag (look at the previous recipe for info),place it on the bottom of the pan,and cover with a layer of rice about 1-2 cm thick.Then,place the meat (fatty side down)in a pile and add in the rest of the rice.Drizzle the saffron infusion on top and cover tightly with a lid wrapped in cotton fabric.Put on low heat.After 40 minutes of cooking,add the melted but-ter and simmer for 10-15 minutes.Place the cooked rice and meat onto a plate and sprinkle pome-granate seeds on top.Shuyudlu Plov (Plov with Fennel)Rice (Arborio)-600 g Lamb or Veal (Brisket or Shoulder)-1 kg Fennel-2 bunches Broad Beans-150 g Saffron-0.2 g Melted Butter-50-100 g Pomegranate (Sweet-sour)-1.Salt

Salt and Pepper-to taste Plov borani is a dish widespread in the southern regions of Azerbaijan,where the type of pumpkin used in its making is called bora.Start by washing the pumpkin,removing the

3-4 minutes.Wash the rice,strain it and put it on top of the pumpkin.Add water,cover with a lid and put on low heat.Cook until ready.Plov borani is commonly eaten with smoked fish,separated from bone and cartilage.There is also another separate dish called bo-rani.Cooking meat that is spinning is called doner,but when the meat is made from a whole carcass,it is called buryan.The use of roasted meat is embedded in the traditions of Turkic cui-sine.Pre-cooked roast meat would traditionally be left for the winter and used to make a variety of dishes.The same process is used for buryan,(which later became burani,and then borani).During the hot seasons the dish is prepared with-out meat and instead uses pumpkins,beans,etc.Azerbaijani Cuisine 55 Shah Plov Rice (Arborio)-600 g Lamb

add the onion,salt and pepper to taste,and fry for another 20 minutes.Next sprinkle the meat with pomegranate seeds.Peel the potatoes and eggplant,and chop into big pieces.Wash the peppers and remove the seeds and partitions,cutting them into 8 pieces.Now wash the tomatoes and cut them into circles.In a separate skillet heat up the remaining sheep’s tail fat,and fry the po-tatoes,eggplants,peppers and tomatoes one by one until they are cooked.When serving,place the meat in the middle of the saj with the vegetables surrounding it on the sides.Di-vide the lavash (pita bread)into 4 pieces and put on top of the saj.Sajiki can also be cooked from poultry.Azerbaijani Cuisine 87 Flour\Dough dishes Kneading dough for hot dough dishes Flour-400 g Egg-1 Water-as Required Salt-to taste Pour the flour in a hill and making a groove in the middle.Add the egg and water to the indent and knead the dough.Divide it into small balls and roll them out very thin (1 mm),and let slightly harden.For arishta (noodles)the dough should be cut as follows:fold the sheet of dough a few times and cut into very thin slices (1-2 mm in width).Then,sprinkle with a little flour and let dry.These noodles can then be stored for several months.For yarpag (leaf-like)hangyal,cut the dough sheets into diamonds with sides of about 3-4 cm.For dyushbara or gurzu,use moist dough,cut the sheet into squares of about 2x2 cm and use them immediately without letting them dry.The size of the squares for gyurza should be bigger than those of dyushbara.Azerbaijani Cuisine 89 Gyurza Dough (Make,as Shown at the Beginning of This Section)Lamb or Beef (Boneless)-500 g Onions-200 g Sheep’s Tail Fat-100 g (For Those Who Want It)Dill-1 bunch Sarimsagli Gatig Sauce (Yogurt with Chopped Garlic)-to taste Salt and Pepper-to taste Experts have suggested that the name of this dish comes from the Turkic word gyurz (gyurza),which trans-lates as “oval.” One of the elements of Turkic architec-ture is called gyurz and implies an oval shape.There is also an ancient weapon called gyurz.To start,make minced meat with onions and sheep’s tail fat.Add salt and pepper to taste,and fry well to-gether.Roll the dough and,using a glass cup,cut it into small circles.On each circle place some of your cooked beef and close it up from both sides by making seams in the shape of a snake.Leave a small hole at one end of the seam.Next,cook the Gyurza in broth or salted water for 5-10 minutes (until the dumplings start to float to the surface of the water)and using a slotted spoon place them on a plate.Drizzle with sarimsagli gatig sauce or tomato sauce and sprinkle with dill.Alternatively,the gyurza can be placed into a bowl with 1-2 tablespoons of broth or melted butter.You can also fry the gyurza.90 Azerbaijani Cuisine Arishta Dough (Make,as Shown at the Beginning of This Section)Chicken-500 g Onions-100 g Coriander and Dill-1 beam Sirke-sarymsag Sauce (Vinegar with Garlic)-40 g or Abgora (Juice of Unripe Grapes)-60 g or Pomegranate Juice-60 g Salt and Pepper-to taste The root arish in Turkic languages means “parallel lines.” In this case,the noodles for this dish are cut into thin parallel lines.As a rule,arishta needs to be cooked in chicken broth.To make the chicken broth,cook the chicken in boiling water with a whole onion.Once cooked,strain the chicken broth.Next,roll the dough thinly and cut into noodles the length of 5 cm.Put them in the broth and cook,stirring occasionally so that the noodles do not stick together.Cook for 15-20 minutes until ready.Add salt and pepper to taste.Finely chop the fresh herbs and put them in the pot just before serving.This dish is usually served with Sirke-sarymsag sauce,pome-granate juice or abgora.Azerbaijani Cuisine 91 Khamirashi (Soup with Beans and Noodles)The name of this dish consists of two Turkic words:khamir (dough)and ash (food).The literal translation:"food from dough." Khamirashi should be cooked in beef broth.Make minced lamb and form it into meatballs about 3-4 cm in diameter.Boil the beans separately.Roll the dough to a thickness of 1 mm and cut into strips the length of 5 cm to make the noodles.In the broth,cook the meatballs first,then add in the noodles and the boiled beans.Right before the dish is done cooking,or be-fore serving,sprinkle some chopped herbs or dried mint.Separately,serve the Sirke-sarimsag sauce.Dough (Make,as Shown at the Beginning of This Section)Lamb or Beef (with Bones)-500 g Onions-150 g Vegetable Oil or Melted Butter-60 g Small White Beans-100 g Sirke-sarimsag Sauce (Vinegar with Garlic)-40 g Coriander,Dill-1 beam each Dried Mint-2 g Salt and Pepper-to taste 92 Azerbaijani Cuisine Dushbara Dough (Make,as Shown at the Beginning of This Section)Lamb or Beef (Boneless)-500 g Onions-150 g Sirke-sarimsag Sauce (Vinegar with Crushed Onion or Garlic-40 g)Dried Mint-20 g Salt and Pepper-to taste Translated from Turkic languages the words tosh and dash mean "filled up" and "spill out",respectively.The word berek means "food" (dishes made from dough).This explains the origin of the name of the dish,that is,when the water is at the point of reaching the top of the pot and spilling out after boiling,the dushbara should be added in.First,mince the meat together with onions and add salt to taste.Thinly roll out the dough and cut it into squares of 2x2 cm.Put a little meat in each square and fold from one corner to another,making a triangle.Then,connect the other two corners of the re-sulting triangle to each other,making small shell-shaped figures.Now boil 2 liters of salted water.When the water comes to a boil,add in all the dush-bara.When they float up to the top,the dish is ready.Dushbara is usually served sprinkled with dried mint.Add Sirke-sarimsag sauce to taste.One spoon should fit,on average,about 5-8 dushbara,but in rural areas of Absheron,experienced cooks can prepare dushbara in such small sizes that one spoonful can contain more than 20 pieces! Bets are a very common occurrence and sometimes the name of the dish is jokingly referred to as "dush beri",i.e."fall here," asking for as much as possible to fit onto the spoon.This dish can also be prepared with chicken or meat broth.Azerbaijani Cuisine 93 Umaj Flour-250 g Butter-80 g Eggs-2.Onions-80 g Dried Mint-20 g Saffron-0.1 g Salt and Pepper-to taste The name of this dish comes from the Turkic word ovmaj (ovmag),which means "to grind","to crush."

boil.Next,shake the flour mixture in a sieve to rid it of excess flour (otherwise the dish will be too thick).Add the umaj to the boiling broth,making sure to stir continu-ously.Before serving,pour in the saf-fron infusion (for 1 gram of saffron use 3 tablespoons of boiling water),and sprinkle with dried mint.94 Azerbaijani Cuisine Yarpag khangal Dough (Make,as Shown at the Beginning of This Section)Onions-250 g Butter-100 g Sarimsagli Gatig Sauce (Yogurt with Garlic)Salt and Pepper-to taste There is a suggestion that the word khangal is derived from two Turkic words:gan,mean-ing “to be filled”,“feeling good” and gal – “to be left.” Accordingly,the name of this dish translates as the act of being satisfied after a hearty and tasty meal.It is made out of a thinly rolled sheet (sheet in Turkic languages is yarpag,yaprak)of dough.To start,roll out the dough to a thickness of 2 mm and cut diamonds approximately 5-6 cm in size.Pour 2 liters of water into a pot and bring to a boil.Then,add salt to the water and throw in the dough pieces.Cook for 8-10 min-utes and strain.After straining the khangal quickly lay them out on plates and pore over with hot butter so they do not stick together.Khangal is served with different toppings,including giyma (roasted minced meat)and/or dry cheese (such as parmesan).It is also rec-ommended to pore over with sarimsagli gatig sauce (yogurt with crushed garlic).You can also sprinkle the dish with pomegranate seeds.Azerbaijani Cuisine 95 Tutm=j Dough (Make as Shown at the Beginning of This Section)Lamb (Boneless)-1 kg White Beans-350 g Onions-300 g (for Meat)Garlic-1-2 Head Dried Mint-10 g Salt and Pepper-to taste The name of this hearty dish comes from the Turkic verb tutmak (to keep,to leave).In this case the dish

that is baked from wheat flour.Baking churek uses wheat flour of the highest quality:1st grade; 2nd grade and wholemeal flour.For every 1 kg of flour,12 g of yeast,15-17 g of salt and 5 g of poppy seeds are used.Sometimes some of the water (500 mL)is substituted with whey (or buttermilk).The temperature of the dough should be 32 ° C.It should take about 1.5 to 2 hours for the dough to ferment and rise.After the dough rises,it is spread into round-shaped pieces and divided in a way that the finished product yields bread weighing 0.5 kg,0.8 kg or 1 kg.After letting the dough "rest" it is rolled into a round or oval shape,the top of which is rubbed with a mixture of egg and water (with a ratio of 1:1)and sprinkled with poppy seeds.The moisture content of churek varies with the type of flour used:with flour of the highest quality it is 42%; first-grade flour yields a moisture con-tent of 44%; while using second-grade flour yields a 45% moisture content.In terms of acidity,different uses of flour yield different results with degrees of 3,4 and 5 generated respectively (acidity is determined using 1 g of alkali,which is needed to neutralize the acid contained in 100 g of bread crumbs,and is expressed in degrees).is the source of life and an irreplaceable product.It is a symbol of friendship,vows and trust.From ancient times,the national breads of Azerbaijan include most famously lavash and yuha.In Turkic languages,lavash signifies a type of pita of various thicknesses.Yuha means "layering" (meaning to lay the dough on a saj)which is also another variation of a type of thin pita.Yayma means "rolling" (as in to roll out the dough on a saj)and is another type of thin bread.Since ancient times,as well as in the present,the variation in the types of bread is very high all throughout the country.There are both simple and more advanced national bread products.Simple bread products are made using yeast and freshwater dough with flour,yeast,salt and water,while the more advanced baked goods are made with dough with the addition of sugar,milk,eggs,butter,gatig (plain yogurt),honey,fruit puree,pumpkin puree,spices,and other products.The simple national bread products include churek,ajitmali,bazzamach,bozlamach,nazik (thin),lavash,yukha (delicate),kezdama (made in coal),kyoka,kyemba,kulava,kyullu komba,kyullama,sajappak,se-mani-churek (with sesame seeds),sangyak,sigirdili,khamrali,jad,jardali,kure churek and others.The ad-vanced bread products include begim-churek,gabagl-churek (churek with pumpkin),gatlama,goghal (bun),gozlu kyoka (pastry with nuts),saffron nazuk,pshi,syudchurek,fetir,chaychurek,ovma,shorgogal and many others Churek is baked out of dough in a tendir (furnace).Starting from ancient times,and still continuing on today,Azerbaijani people have been making tendir-churek in the comfort of their homes.The dough used for this bread is kneaded with the addition of home-made yeast (leaven)(khamirmaya).To do this,each time bread is baked a little piece of dough is left and placed in a small kyup (clay pot),or in a bowl of wood.It is then sprinkled with salt,so that the dough does not mold,and stored in a cool place for later use.When the need to bake bread arises,6 to 8 hours (sometimes a day)before baking,flour (about 1.5-2 kg)is added to the old dough and mixed with warm water to make a new watery mixture (adzhihamra).Then,about 8 to10 kg of flour is added to the soured dough along with salt and warm water,after which the dough is kneaded.The fermentation process,for the dough to rise,should take at least 1 hour.When the dough is suitable (rises),it is divided into round pieces weighing approximately 500-600 g.At the same time,the tendir is heated using wood or large branches of various forest trees.The walls of the tendir are first covered with black soot to protect it from the smoke,and after fully heated,becomes white.The re-sulting flameless,red-hot coals are collected in a pile in the middle of the bottom of the tendir.The walls of the tendir are also wiped with a damp cloth,which is wrapped around a long wooden stick.During the time it takes to heat the tendir,the dough balls should rise and become ready.The balls of dough are then rolled out using the hands to a thickness of 6 to 8 mm.Then,the top is rubbed with an egg and water mixture (with a ratio of 1:1)and sprinkled with poppy seeds,garachurek (Nigella seeds),or sesame seeds.Afterwards,holes are poked with a fork or wooden pin and the dough is stuck vertically to the walls of the tendir.Baking lasts about 10 to 12 minutes.After baking,Churek is removed from the walls of the tendir with a towel.Then,using a long stick with a hook on the end (Koga),the opposite side is hooked and held close over the bottom coals,until the bread becomes a light brownish-red color on top.Once the churek is baked,it is spread on a tablecloth to cool.For storage,churek is put into a large pot or rolled into cloth and kept in a large wooden bowl (tekhna).In rural areas tendir-churek is baked to last about 4 to 5 days.Azerbaijani Cuisine 105 Bread Fatir (Flat Bread)Wheat Flour-150 g Pressed Yeast-3 g Water-50 ml Vegetable Oil (For Lubricating the Sheets)-50 g Salt-one pinch Start by heating the water to a temperature of 35-40° C.Add the prepared yeast,salt,and flour,and knead the dough.Place the dough into any cookware and cover with a lid,letting it fer-ment (rise)in a room with a temperature of 35-40° C for 3-4 hours.When the dough rises and increases 1.5 times in volume,re-knead it once more.Next,form the dough into a thin,round or oval shape,and place in a pan pre-lubricated with oil.Bake for 10-15 minutes at a temperature of 200-220° C or over coals in a tendir.jyoka Translated from Turkic languages,the word kyoka means "chubby" or "plump".There is also a sugges-tion that the word kyoka comes from the Turkic word gyok (gok),which means “sky,” “clear,” or “bright.” Kyoka looks very similar to another pastry called gogal,and both of have come to represent the sun.Kyoka is much smaller in size than tendir-churek and is usually baked for children.There is no exact recipe but it is known that the dough is kneaded with milk and sugar (sometimes with cooked sheep’s tail fat)and yeast.When baking,the top is smeared with egg yolk mixed with infused saffron and sprinkled with poppy seeds.106 Azerbaijani Cuisine Lavash The etymology of the word lavash is connected with the Turkic word laksha (wheat flour).As a result of the metathesis of the letters in its name,the word transformed into lavash through the following means:laksha → lagsha → lavsha → lavash.This is a national kind of bread made from un-leavened or leavened (home-made hamirmaya)dough.Compared with other types of bread,lavash contains no crumb.First the leavened dough is kneaded,and fermented for about 1.5 hours.Next,the dough is formed into small balls and put to rest for 15-25 minutes.Then,it is rolled out thinly and baked on a saj or in a tendir for 3-5 minutes.In Nakhchivan,Ordubad,Sharur,Karabakh,and other regions lavash is baked in a tendir for the whole family and lasts about 2-3 months.This type of lavash resembles thin crackers and does not become moldy for 3 months.3-4 hours before eating they are sprinkled with water or gyulabom (tincture of rose petals),and wrapped in a towel.As a result,the lavash becomes soft and edible.Elapardi (Pancakes)Wheat Flour-500 g Milk-200 ml Water-200 ml Soda-5 g,Egg-1 pc.Sugar-100 g Vegetable Oil-100 g,Salt-one pinch.These thin pancakes are so light that they are called elapardi,which trans-lates from Turkic languages as “carried away by the wind." To start,mix the water with the milk,add the egg,salt,baking soda,sugar and flour and whisk until the batter is ready.In a cast-iron pan,pour in a little oil and heat up.Using a large spoon,pour in the batter in even portions and fry on both sides.Elapardi is usually eaten with honey and served hot.Azerbaijani Cuisine 107 108 Azerbaijani Cuisine Yukha (Thin Flat Bread)The word yukha translates as “thin" or "tender" from Turkic languages.Yukha is made from unleavened dough.After kneading,let the dough rest for 20-30 minutes.Then,re-knead the dough and cut it into small pieces,rolling them out into round shapes with a thickness of 1-3 mm.Finally,bake them on a hot saj.If during storage the yukha becomes stale,spray the surface with water or gyulabom (tincture of rose petals),wrap in a tea towel and leave for 40-50 minutes.Yukhais usually eaten with cheese,syuzma or shor (salted cottage cheese).Sometimes lyula-kebab (pg.28)is also served on the table wrapped in yukha.Azerbaijani Cuisine 109 Pastries Shekerbura Almonds or Hazelnuts-1 kg Sugar-1 kg Cardamom Seeds-8-10 pcs.Flour-2 kg Eggs (Yolks)-10 pcs.Sour Cream-800 g Butter-750 g Milk-200 ml Yeast-10 g Salt-1 pinch The ancient name of this sweet,whose appearance resembles and symbolizes the crescent,is derived from the Turkic word burek (pie,food)and the word sheker (sugar,sweet),and literally translates as "sweet pie." Start by soaking the yeast in 70 ml of milk,adding 1 tablespoon of sugar and mix it with the flour.Then,add the remaining milk and melted butter.Knead the dough and let sit in a warm place for 30 minutes.Grind the almonds or hazelnuts and cardamom,and mix it with the sugar.Now roll out the dough and cut it into round shapes (the size of a tea saucer).Place the sugar-stuffing on the dough,make a pattern of stitches and close up the circles.The top is usually decorated with further stitching patterns (for instance,in the shape of a Christmas tree).Now place them in a preheated oven.Bake at 180 ° C for 30-40 minutes.Stop baking before the surface turns golden brown.Azerbaijani Cuisine 111 Pakhlava Walnuts (Peeled)-1.5 kg Butter-500 g Eggs-2 Flour-800 g Sugar-1.5 kg Rose Petal Infusion-100 g Saffron-0.2 g Water or Milk-600 ml Khash-Khash (Poppy)-10 g Pistachios or Almonds-50 g Salt-1 pinch The title of this pastry comes from its appearance-a diamond,the symbol of fire,which is referred to as a pakhla in Azerbaijani carpet designs.This is one of the holiday sweets that are baked on Novruz Bayram (the festival which celebrates the arrival of Spring),in honor of the stars in the sky.There is also a theory that the word pakhlava comes from the word bakala (baglama),which in Turkic languages means “to bind” or “to layer,” i.e.layers of sweet dough that are bound to each other.Start by adding 2 egg yolks,100 g of softened butter and a pinch of salt to the flour and knead the dough.Now divide it into 10 equal parts.Peel the nuts (you can do this by dropping them into boiling water),dry them and grind,mixing the result with the sugar.Divide the sugar stuffing into 7 parts and thickly grease a baking pan with butter.Next,roll one part of the dough to a thin layer and put it on the baking pan,making sure the edges stick to the sides of the pan.Brush the first layer with butter and put on another layer of dough,again greasing the top with butter.Add a coat of walnut-sugar filling,then add another sheet of dough,and repeat these steps until you run out of dough.Make sure that between the last layers of dough (9 and 10),similar to layers 1 and 2,there is only butter.Carefully sculpt the edges,compacted by hand.Now you must infuse the saffron (for 2 g of saffron use 6 tablespoons of boiling water).Cut the compacted pakhlava into diamond shapes.Using a brush,coat the entire surface with the saffron tincture.Place white poppy seeds in the corners of the diamond and push half of a pistachio or almond into the middle.Bake in the oven at 180 ° C for one hour.Once the pan has warmed,pore over the pakhlava with the rest of the butter.Now make syrup out of sugar and water by boiling them together and adding in the tincture of rose petals,immediately pouring it over the finished baklava.When the pan has cooled,put the diamonds out onto a plate or in a pot.Pakhlava can be stored for 10-15 days.112 Azerbaijani Cuisine Shorgogal For the
