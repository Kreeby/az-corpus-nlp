Foreword
This is my second acguaintance with the 
crea  ve ac  vity of Ingilab Nadirli. I discovered 
the poet four years ago, when I read his poem 
“My World of Mugham”. The poem making a 
deep impression on me, I shared my views on the 
book with the readers in the press. 
In the manuscript of this book-“My World 
of aphorisms” wri  en by the prominent poet-
scien  st, public fi gure Ingilab Nadirli, aphorisms, 
edifying words, words of admonishment have 
found their refl ec  on. In the book aphorisms, 
wri  en in verses, which came down from his pen 
in diff erent years and edifying words have been 
collected. The word “aphorism” which is of Greek 
origin, expreses the meaning of “ A deep thought 
as to the form and essence, brief word, having 
deep contens, a word combina  on or a sentence. 
Not every person can write aphorism.The person, 
wri   ng aphorism, must posses great wit, wide 
world out-look, life experience and must know a 
number of sciences.
The author has presented aphorisms, gained 
6 7
Ingilab Nadirli MY WORLD of Aphorisms
as a result of generalized form of life lessons, 
taking places in the world, in the clear, completed, 
precise forms.
Each person, having read these aphorisms 
can fi nd himself/herself just here. The importance 
of these aphorisms lies just in this, the reader, 
taking lessons from these thoughts, having taking 
advantage these thoughts, should do favorable 
deeds for humanity. These aphorisms, possessing 
great vital power are nourished from the spring 
of wi   ness. 
The book consists of two parts. In the fi rst 
part of the book are created aphorisms, having 
turned to laws of life, which can be considered 
as life code of human beings which are gained 
as a result of life lessons which he/she learned 
in life. The young person, having cleared up the 
thoughts which he/she cognized in life, accepts 
them and as a result of this admonishing, 
edifying aphorisms, fi  ul for the upbringing of 
new genera  on, are created.
The person, having cognized the world, 
by crea  ng aphorisms becomes matured and 
developed himself, turns to a wi  y person:
    
I cognized the world, wrote aphorisms,
Found my own self in life lessons. 
A  er this, as it has been men  oned in the 
second part of the book, the very person educates 
and breeds up the other people, the society. In 
this part of the book, we see that this man, who 
has become matured, educated, who has gained 
much life experience, and who has become as 
a wi  y person, creates aphorisms, to educate 
the society. Each of these aphorisms have been 
taken from life. These aphorisms, created for the 
sake of educa  ng the people involves the whole 
society. 
The author, who has aimed at crea  ng an 
ideal person by the force of these aphorisms, 
we may say, that has achieved this goal. The 
aphorisms presented in the book, have been 
grounded on the mo  ves to challenge the people 
to do good for the sake of humanity.  I have never 
come across in the Azerbaijani literature such a 
big-volumed, completed a second book, having a 
plot consis  ng of aphorisms.
The poet, who has passed honored way of 
life, who has perfectly mastered a number of 
sciences, who loves his na  ve land, his people, 
toilsome labour, dispatches to the readers that in 
the essence of this love lies a truth.
The poet in a small descrip  on, consis  ng of 
each couplet as if with the brush of a painter has 
weaved up an ornament of a poem

Ingilab Nadirli MY WORLD of Aphorisms
If you value  me more than anything,
Any instant of life shall turn to history.
* * *
Don’t spare  me in life for nonsense,
A man is born to life only just once.
* * *
The life given by God is like fl ower,
Perish it with cigar, never.
The poet, by using the valuable treasure of 
word, by mysterious keys of his own fascina  ng 
word, has considered his purposeful debt to 
the people, his divine words, consis  ng of 
meaningful sayings in the concise form. Ingilab 
Nadirli, having wonderful imagina  on, poe  c 
inspira  on, is one of few poets, who has been able 
to put mathema  cal sign of equality between the 
language and poem, namely, between the things 
which belong to people and the individual, and 
has masterfully managed doing all this.
We should set the following examples of 
aphorisms to jus  fy the men  oned above.
A word is more valuable than precious stones,
Some  mes one word saves the fate of a man.
* * *
Science is in the world the precious thing,
It only makes the world migh  er, but nothing.
* * *
If form true words you build up your tomb 
It will make you always live in history, just for all.
* * *
If you stop in our world blood shed
You  shall live forever, all the wi  y have this said.
The majority of the aphorisms of Ingilab 
Nadirli have derived from the fi ght for human 
moral and human dignity. Generally, the coloring, 
fi  ul to the literary truth, is able to describe 
masterfully, all instances by poe  c mode of 
thinking. Ingilab Nadirli’s aphorisms, which have 
turned to the chronology of the  me, in which he 
lived, having gained world-wide importance is of 
great character - the character of all the mankind.
The scope of his poetry is very vast, rich and 
many-sided. As I.Nadirli has wri  en these poe  c 
specimens with inspira  on has gone far from 
the general rhetorics and just from this view 
point is diff erent from many other poets. In the 
aphorisms, the poet expresses love to humanity, 
to the mankind, to the mothers, to the na  ve 
land with self – belonging to him poe  c style.
The poet, who has turned his life for the 
scales of honor and for the desire for pardon, 
praises the moral atmosphere of his life, the 
mode of life with which he lived, in his poems:
10 11
Ingilab Nadirli MY WORLD of Aphorisms
If a child does not obey the mother,
His/her child won’t do it either.
* * *
 Examine just yourself only in this world,
 That the scales of honor shall tell true word.
* * *
 If you occupy the world, being brave,
 You’ll have in the end a room for grave.
The poet has wri  en a plenty of aphorisms, 
dealing with mother, mother-land, world, beauty, 
gracefulness, the love to the motherland, support 
for other peoples, respect for all religions are in 
his blood. In fact a poet must be just like this. As 
like the motherland, star  ng with border poles, 
the writer’s conscious life should also begin with 
the star  ng point of motherland, love for the 
whole land. The wi  y - scented fl owers of poetry 
of Ingilab Nadirli, having taken their colors from 
the fascina  ng beau  es of nature, have turned to 
the moral wealth of all the peoples of the world.
These perfume-scented specimens of poe  c 
aphorisms, having thousands of shades of colors 
make the readers think, causes to awoke feelings 
in them. The poet has got too many couplets fi lled 
with the feelings of love for na  ve land, dignity, 
gracefulness and beauty. In such poems there are 
tender, saint lines, as many as may be desired:
A man rises higher by a good name
His labor, his work, and his child, bring him fame
* * *
 Unless you fi nd a devoted wife,
 You cannot be happy, in your life.
* * *
 There is a saint dead-more than alive one
 There is a living dead, that can’t be alive, none.
Ingilab Nadirli who is calm –natured by 
character is stronger inside and at the same  me 
a very sensi  ve poet. When we get acquainted 
with his personal life and his crea  ve ac  vity, 
you can’t help admiring expression of his love 
for the whole mankind, his strong will. God has 
presented this lucky person not only physically 
perfec  on but also healthy spirits, passionate 
inspira  on, endless love of life. S  ll more- and 
more themes are awai  ng him. This man, being 
an experienced master of pen, at the same  me 
being energe  c and ac  ve artsman, is marching 
up the way to the peak of crea  ve ac  vity, 
without having a moment’s rest.
Dear readers, here comple  ng my words, 
I leave you face–to face with the world of 
aphorisms of Ingilab Nadirli.

Ingilab Nadirli MY WORLD of Aphorisms
Prologue
   
I lived a long life and suff ered much more.
I understood the life, and I tell you for,
I have seen the life sweet and bi  er,
Time is a doctor, treats you be  er.
The life has taught me, educated me,
How to love people, love my country.
I am a man and man is highest of all.
Though some  mes he rises, some  mes falls,
God Almighty has gi  ed him everything,
For he is a beauty, the nicest being.
Though the man is always the best of the best,
Life has given him a test a  er test.
The law of life is just how behave,
If you bow not the king, you’re a slave.
You’re too clever, but not a ruler,
Before ruling people wit is smaller.
Don’t rely on your health, on the sharpest wit,
Don’t thing you are strong, you are too swi  ,
Don’t forget what I say, bear in mind,
Clever men always have foes of all kind.
The life taught me this, -follow my track,
I learned them all over to give to you back.
Try them in life what I said to you,
Punish me what I said, unless is true.
I wanted to think of a good, ideal man,
To make him too true as much as I can
The lessons that taught me, my life again,
The ones I call back with pride, fame,
I thought it my honour to say them to you.
I emp  ed all my heart, and I relaxed too.
If you do all I said here, just you see
You’ll get to all doors with a fi  ul key.
I wanted to write true work of art,
 I found true men-able and smart.
I recollected all  my life and much I tried,
To write aphorisms I made up my mind.
Having learned sense of words, thinking of them too
My true, real world ı revealed to you!
Having seen injus  ce, I burned and I thought
The things you are reading, I just myself wrote.
I call this “aphorisms” which I wrote, I have done,
Devoted them to all people, to the daughter, to the son.

Ingilab Nadirli MY WORLD of Aphorisms
From the editor who is that man ?...
I considered the life of this very man,
Tried to describe him as well as I can.
Who is just  this person, do, listen please?, 
He has never found, life just at ease.
He was born as any-   a small child.
But he was clever and full of mind.
Alas, very early his father, he lost.
He grieved and mourned for his father most.
He got his energy from the mother,
He got inspira  on, with deed together.
Being li  le child he loved to toil,
He ploughed with ox, planted soil.
He got inspira  on from work, he did, 
To do honest labor ’s for him splendid.
In many hard  mes, he prayed his God 
God’s almighty, he never forgot
He was smart- looking in life, he lived
To learn mysteries of world – he believed
With passion in his heart, with power  in arm,
With sweat on forehead, with corn in the palm,
He worked all day long, but read at night,
Learned all the science, with  wit and might .
Labor brought him up, he became young,
He entered high school- clever, strong.
He was all in labor, always, every day,
I watched him in life, always, I may say.
He loved all sciences, deep in the heart,
He loved literature, also fi ne- art.
He began his fi rst work at city school,
His life just began from very nil.
There were not enough for the pupils rooms,
He had fi ve rooms built, for the school.
He was known as builder from very day,
Opened for future, a luckiest way.
With new good dreams, he rose to the top,
He rose to the skies, he would not stop.
He joined the army, on a bright noon,
In dreams he fl u to stars, to moon.
He served in the army and life he learned,
For two years he learned, good name he earned 
Came back to his land, with  the loving heart,
With too many dreams, to work to start.
Having mobilized all youths around,
Became a leader, easiness found,
He headed a kolkhoz, which lagged behind
Found novelty in work, in mind,
He held just new posts from day to day,
Jus  fi ed the trust, without delay.
He was sent to a district on the mountain,
As an able worker, as a captain.
There he laid town, laid streets,
156 157
Ingilab Nadirli MY WORLD of Aphorisms
He fought enemies, with his heavy deeds.
He laid broad ways through mountains,
He conquered mountains, le   behind him.
He gave to people just all the riches,
He did just all he can, people to please.
He did all the hard work, for people of own,
Very soon became eminent, known.
He got all the lessons in life, he lived,
In all the victories he got, he believed.
He did just hardest jobs, never got  red,
The work that he just did, himself admired.
With science, with labor in life he lived,
Then to the parliament he was just received.
There he supported, always true laws,
He learned in details, just every clause.
He put forth  sugges  ons, fi t for history
That people in life, should not be sorry.
Such is my hero, his life story!...
He was sent as a head to backward region,
Honest work and labor was his religion.
There were too many problems to solve,
He did them with hard work and with deepest love.
He went against myth, which  just used to be,
He saw just all the things, people did not see.
He answered with his deeds, what the words just said,
Un  l he did his work, never went to bed.
With science he approached the all, that he did,
The  me, history tested him in deed.
With science in life more he discovered,
Good reviews were wri  en which were never bad.
His work was too highly valued in the world.
His friends loved him too for valuable work
He learned much science every passing day,
He saw way of science to be rightest way.
All admired him for his talent, wit,
Interna  onal awards always he received.
He saw all the faces of life, he lived,
In honored name, in deed he believed.
In whirlpool of life, hardened as a man,
Held his name higher as much as he can.
He created top works,all his life long,
Wrote  masterpiece, to world to belong.
In diff erent genres wrote his works,
To praise what he did just fail my words.
Songs were composed to his sweet words,
He was devoted too, to the fi nest works.
He created aphorisms from lessons of life,
He reached his desire working day and night.
From just, true words he built up a tomb
He raised his voice to heavens, sky
This man just in life has passed great way
The way of service to mankind,  he has chosen,I may say
Injus  ce, slanders did not stop him
For he was courageous, had faith in him
158
Ingilab Nadirli
He fought injus  ce always and ever
He told right to the wrong, never.
So, he was a herald of always right,
And God assisted him always in fi ght.
Truth and jus  ce shall win, they do say,
His deeds  just  made him, happy day by day,
Honest job has ever been friend to him,
His toil, honest job always shall back him.
He has never known, his deed beforehand,
Not given easy job ever instead.
He has always managed any hardest job
Never said ”no” to job that he had to cope
He lived many lives, just in the one,
He held honor higher, but nothing and none
He valued highly moments of  me,
Not to use a good chance is a crime.
His way of life is a school just for all
The work that he has done is greater, not small.
His way of life is full of just true words
Each man must take lessons from u  ered true words
He created a school for all people, all na  ons,
For thousand years since the  me, since this day
He called the book as a school of educa  on
And was devoted to Mankind, I do say….

Those who bending down rose,
The way of fl a  ery always chose.

Epilogue
Life is a school just to teach us in the world,
My pen’s got inspiration from beauty of the word.
Just studied the life of an experienced man, 
With the force of true words, described him as I can.
With the eyes of honesty looked upon world every day,
I wished only my good words, to universe should lead way.
Life tested my life, proved to be a true man,
I devoted my life, to the justice, all I can.
In the fight for the good, thundered like lighetning,
With flame of my pen perished all wrong, I do think.
I am involved in the just, only word’s my treasure,
Decorated with the words, my life with pleasure.
All my deeds have become, just a sail in the ship
Got pleasure in poems, in true word, friendship.
All sides of my life, I have just seen with the eyes
With words I depicted life, away from all the lies
296
Ingilab Nadirli
I offer all these ones, as remedy for the ill,
All the words I’ve said, shall help you and live still.
Till the end of your life, till the very doom’s day.
They will help just all the men without any delay.
My aphorisms shall just charm every soul, every heart
No boundaries just exist for the good words, for the art.
They’ll stop just burglars from doing crime,
Everything will be valued, by the justice of time.
Good words as history shall live very, very long
For they teach the mankind, to the people they belong.
Unless I write them, I may also feel very bad,
I may often become ill, may feel myself very sad.
Good words are just honey, they’ll nouriush just your heart.
With the order of good words, new nation shall start.
With the gift of Mighty God, set up with words big oceans
That they shall reach all of us, all the people, all nations.
I have chosen best of them, from the word treasure,
To leave them as present, with much love, with pleasure!
With aphorisms I built 
  up a tomb
To remain for ever as 
  if in the home
With the pure words 
  I built a tower
To remain as a hero 
  always in power
I created aphorism from 
  life lessons which I took,
I reached my aim, having wri  en 
  for you  this book.
299
MY WORLD of Aphorisms
With my toil and with my pen, 
 I have laid for me just a way, 
With the beat of my great heart, 
 I have done all which a man may,
I’ve got my inspira  on from 
 my God  night and  day.
Created my world of word, 
 for created is treasure,
It can ever just be valued 
 with no money, with no measure.

lec  ve farm named a  er A.Bunyatov, the second, 
and the fi rst secretary of Aghjabady district Party 
Commi  ee, from 1976 up to 1988 he worked as 
the fi rst secretary of Kelbedjar district branch of 
Communist Party, and from 1994 up to 1999 he 
worked as the head of execu  ve power of Binaga-
di district of Baku city. 
He was elected the depute of Supreme Sovi-
et and also was elected the one of the fi rst mem-
bers of Milli Mejlis  of Azerbaijan.
Ingilab Nadirli is the person:
-Who set the plan of deporta  on of the Peo-
ple of Kelbadjor which was planned by prearme-
nian powers in the ruling bodies of Azerbaijan, up-
side down and received thankfulness by the fi rst 
secretary of the  me Heydar Aliyev. 
- During his work at the head of leading par-
ty organiza  on of the Kelbedjar district, by his 
ini  a  ve and ac  ve par  cipa  on in the period of 
two years,  absolutely free of charge, a vast, ab-
solutely unknown to the people territory on the 
mountain Lachin, where nobody lived  before, 
was opened up. On this territory a road was laid, 
thanks to which the indicated territory in the 
square of 50 hectares was put into agricultural 
use for the good of people. 
-Thanks to his ac  ve, selfl ess ac  vity, Kelbe-
jar district which was considered as a backward 
one, in a short period of  me occupied one of the 
leading places as to the economic indica  ons of 
the districts of the Azerbaijan Republic, and the 
district centre of Kelbedjar in conformity with 
the most advanced tendencies in architecture 
and city building tradi  ons by the  me, was prac-

-Since the beginning of Nagorno-Karabakh 
confl ict by the personal ini  a  ve of Ingilab Na-
dirov and under his supervision, without spend-
ing any state money means, roads leading from 
Kelbedjar district through the mountains Deli-
dagh and Murovdagh, accordingly to Lachin and 
Goygol (former Khanlar district), was laid, thanks 
to which, during the Armenian occupa  on of La-
chin and Kelbedjar districts, lives of thousands of  
peaceful people of these districts were rescued. 
In the memory of these people these roads for-
ever remained as the “salva  on roads” as a sign 
of thankfulness. 
In the period of  me between 1994-1999 
years Nadirov (Nadirli) I.A. worked as the head of 
the execu  ve power of Binagadi district of Baku

showed itself in draining the lake, called “Boyuk 
Shor” and adjoining it swampy territory.

cal recommenda  on in solving these problems 
which seemed unsolvable as to many well-known 
ecologists and hydrologists, but also headed all 
the work, carried out in this purpose, thanks to 
which on this land-site a favourable se  lement 
was built up and government consequently re-
ceived more than 400 billion dollars of  income. 
Besides this, two electric power sta  ons were 
put to exploita  on each of which produced 110 
thousand kilowa   electric energy per hour. These 
electric power sta  ons supply one fourth of the 
popula  on of Baku city with electric energy.

A monument
I don’t want a monument
Made of silver, copper or gold
Of which, to all, I have just told
My saint God has helped me to do,
So that, all my wishes came true.
All my power and energy are just God sent  
All that I’ve done to people turned to a good monument.
My saint God, I’ve gained victories just by your might
I’ve always been true to my people in all fight.
I have conquered mountain Lachin for the people as an eagle 
Made them happy, to the bloom brought life, for the people.
I’ve laid new city,-with my work of architecture with all might
Working too hard for my people selflessly day and night.
I have laid broadways on the top of high Murovdagh very wide
For the people made life very joyful, too bright.
My saint God made me able to keep people in Kelbedjar
They were planned to leave the land, to move to the other site.
I have curbed just “Boyuk shor”, saved Baku from smog
I have found a remedy to all harards with my might.
With my book of “My world1” I discovered a true world 
Having created masterpieces, honour fame I have found.
I shall live on as long as my works of art that just survive,
For which I’ve turned my life to a candle to my mind.
For centuries we struggled for freedom in our land
It is honour for me to say, I took my part in this fight.
Ingilab is just my name, I’ve tried just to rise,
With all my deeds, to all the peaks, as a leader, as a guide.

тарем Агджабединского райкома партии, а затем – пер-
вым секретарем Кельбаджарского райкома Компартии 
Азербайджана. За период работы Надирова (Надирли) 
И.А. на посту руководителя партийной организации 
Кельбаджарского района по его инициативе и актив-
ном участии в течение двух лет был освоен обширный, 
но ранее совершенно безлюдный участок местности на 
горе Лачин и туда проложена дорога, благодаря чему 
данная территория площадью более 50 гектаров была 
введена в сельскохозяйственный оборот на благо наро-
да. Благодаря активной, самоотверженной деятельно-
сти Надирова (Надирли) И.А. ранее отсталый Кельбад-
жарский район в короткий срок был выведен в число 
передовых по основным экономическим показателям, 
а районный центр Кельбаджар в соответствии с самы-
ми передовыми на тот период тенденциями в архитек-
туре и градостроительстве был фактически построен 
заново, получив в народе название «Новый Кельбад-
жар». С началом нагорно-карабахского конфликта по 
личной инициативе и под руководством Надирова 
(Надирли) И.А. без использования государственных 
средств были построены дороги из Кельбаджарского 
района через горы Делидаг и Муров соответственно в 
Лачинский и Гекгельский (бывший Ханларский) райо-
ны, благодаря чему впоследствии, во время оккупации 
Лачинского и Кельбаджарского районов армянскими 
вооружёнными формированиями, были спасены жиз-
ни примерно 100 тысяч мирных жителей этих районов, 
в благодарной памяти которых эти дороги навсегда 
остались «дорогами спасения». В период работы На-
дирова (Надирли) И.А. главой исполнительной власти 
Бинагадинского района г. Баку, в 1994-1999-х гг., по 
его инициативе и деятельном участии нашла решение 
такая ранее не решавшаяся в течение многих десяти-
летий проблема, как осушение озера Бёюк Шор ипри-
легающей к нему заболоченной местности. Надиров 
(Надирли) И.А. не только дал глубокое теоретическое 
обоснование и практические рекомендации по реше-
нию этой проблемы, казавшейся многим известным в 
области гидрологии и экологии специалистам вообще 
неразрешимой, но и осуществлял непосредственное 
руководство всеми проведёнными там работами, бла-
годаря чему на этой территории позднее был построен 
новый благоустроенный поселок, а государство в ито-
ге получило более 300 млн.долларов дохода. Много-
гранна научная деятельность Надирова (Надирли) И.А. 
Его труды широко известны научной общественности, 
используются в качестве учебных пособий в высших 
учебных заведениях республики, переведены на ряд 
иностранных языков. Государственным телевидени-
ем Азербайджанской Республики сняты три докумен-
тальных фильма, посвященных его научным работам 
по проблемам осушении и рекультивации озера Бёюк 
Шор и прилегающей территории, вошедших в золо-
той фонд азербайджанской теледокументалистики. 
Данная деятельность Надирова (Надирли) И.А. легла в 
основу его диссертации, отмеченной в Докладе ООН 
«О развитии человечества» 1996 г. Надиров (Надирли) 
И.А. является автором таких известных книг, нашедших 
заслуженное признание широкого круга читателей, как 
пьеса в стихах «Испытание» (2000 г.), сборники стихов 
«Жизнь как испытание» (2005 г.), и стихотворных афо-

ризмов «В подарок внукам» (2008 г.); поэмы «Мой мир 
мугама» (2009 г.) и «Мои басни (2013 г.).; сборник пу-
блицистических статей «Года, претворенные в жизнь». 
За свою литературную деятельность Надиров (Надир-
ли) И.А. удостоен таких престижных наград, как «Зо-
лотое перо» и «Азербайджанский флаг». На его стихи 
написаны десятки песен, а пьеса «Испытание» по рас-
поряжению президента Азербайджанской Республики 
господина Ильхама Алиева включена в «Антологию 
азербайджанской драматургии». Надиров (Надирли) 
И.А. избирался делегатом 28, 29, 31 и 32 съездов Ком-
мунистической партии Азербайджана, членом Ресизи-
онной Комиссии ЦК Компартии, был депутатом Вер-
ховного Совета Азербайджанской Республики 10-12 
созывов, в том числе членом первого состава Милли 
Меджлиса Азербайджанской Республики (1992-1995 
г.г.), является полковник-лейтенантом запаса. За мно-
голетнюю, большую и плодотворную работу на ответ-
ственных партийных и государственных постах Нади-
ров (Надирли) И.А. удостоен таких высоких в советский 
период наград, как ордена Октябрьской революции, 
«Знак Почета» и Трудового Красного Знамени, отме-
чен званием «Отличник сельского хозяйства СССР». 
За годы, прошедшие после восстановления государ-
ственной независимости Азербайджана, Надиров (На-
дирли) И.А. за большие заслуги в развитии экономики, 
литературы и науки тюркского мира избран почётным 
профессором Международной Акадамии Исследова-
ний Тюркского Мира и удостоен Золотой медали этой 
академии.Большой жизненный путь Надирова (Надир-
ли) И.А. нашёл широкое отражение в азербайджанской 
литературе. Так, известный поэт Джавад Джавадлы 
посвятил ему роман в стихах «Превыше вершин», ряд 
других авторов – публицистический сборник «Дни 
вместе с Кельбаджаром и Ингилабом», стихотворный 
литературно-художественный сборник «Следы из жиз-
ни» и публицистический книг Алирза Халафли «При-
шел к слову». Ингилаб Адиль оглы Надиров находится 
в расцвете творческих сил. Он является главой боль-
шой дружной семьи: у него любящая супруга, пятеро 
детей и восемь внуков. Сердечно поздравляем уважа-
емого академика Ингилаб Адиль оглы Надирова и же-
лаем ему крепкого здоровья.
