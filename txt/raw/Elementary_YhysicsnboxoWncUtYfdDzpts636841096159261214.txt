CHAPTER 1 
  
Kinematics 
 
 
§ 1.1. Mechanical motion.  Kinematic concepts    
 
Mechanics is a branch of physics treating the simple forms of 
motion of bodies in space and time. It is divided into kinematics, 
dynamics and statics. Kinematics is study the pure motion 
without regard to its cause. 
Mechanical motion of a body is the  change in its position 
with time relative to other bodies. Mechanical motion has mainly 
two  types; translational and rotatory. The simplest motion of a 
body is translational motion during which all points of a body 
move similarly, describing identical trajectories. The paths in a 
translational motion can be either straight lines or curves. Note, 
that in translational motion 
any straight line drawn in a  
body, remains parallel to 
itself ( Fig.1.1a) . The 
motions of the needle in a 
sewing machine and of the 
hood in a motor car are translational.                 Fig.1.1 
In rotary motion, all points of  the body move in circles, 
whose  centers  lie on the same straight line ( Fig.1.1b). This line 
is called  the rotational  axis.  Note, rotational  axis  in   the given 
reference frame may be  either in move or at rest.                                                      
 15 
 For example, an axis of   rotor of generator at electric  power  
station is at rest relative  the Earth, while an axis of  wheel of 
automobile is removing. 
To solve some problems in mechanics it is necessary to 
consider the body as a mass point. 
Point mass.. A body whose dimensions can be neglected 
under of the given problem is called a point mass . 
For instance, Earth can be considered like a mass point during 
the revolving around the Sun. 
The position of a body in space can be determined only with 
respect to other objects.  
To describe the  motion of   body it is necessary to locate the 
positions of several points of it.  This is done by various systems 
of coordinates. In rectangular coordinates of  position of point in  
space is indicated by giving its distances x, y and z from three  
perpendicular lines  
called  the   x  axis, 
 y  axis and z  axis  
respectively (Fig.1.2) 
A reference  body to  
which coordinates are  
fixed   and   mutually  
synchronized  clocks 
 form  so - called 
 reference frame.                                Fig.1.2 
Path of motion. A certain line which is described  by each 
point of the body during the motion is called the path of motion.. 
The path and graph of motion must be distinguished. So that, 
trajectory of body thrown vertically  is  linear; while graph of 
motion, i.e. dependence of vertical coordinate on the  time is 
parabolic. The trajectory of motion may depend on the choice of 
the reference frame. 
 Depending on the view of trajectory the translational motion 
of a body may be   rectilinear   or  curvelinear. 
 16 
If the trajectory is a straight line the motion of the point is 
referred to as rectilinear. If the path is a curve, the motion is said 
to be curvelinear. 
Distance. Distance is known as a scalar quantity equal the 
length of any part of trajectory. Distances passed by a body are 
added arithmetically. 
Displacement.   Suppose that a 
body has moved from point M to 
point  N (Fig.1.3) The length of 
segment MN  is  the  distance  
traveled.  The  vector  NM

 directed 
from the initial position to  the                                   
final one  is called  the  
displacement of the body.                                   Fig.1.3                                                        
The motion may be either uniform or nonuniform due to  
character of the velocity. First consider  the simplest form - 
uniform rectilinear motion. 
 
 
§1. 2. Uniform rectilinear motion 
 
A motion in which a body covers equal distances in  equal 
intervals of time is known as uniform motion. The velocity in 
uniform motion is numerically equal  the distance traveled per 
unit time.

equal to the area   of polygon between velocity graph and x  axis. 
Temporary dependences for (a) velocity, (b) displacement (c) 
and (d) coordinate and  (e) distance traveled are illustrated in 
(Fig.1.4).

 In Fig.1.4a  upper and downer graphs  correspond to the 
positive and negative directions of  x  axis  respectively. 
A component of displacement along any axis is the difference 
of final and original coordinates. For example, x-component of 
displacement is given by 
 
                                S 0xxx   .                                (1.2)

§1.3. Average   velocity  in  rectilinear motion 
 
Since the ratio of the distance to the corresponding time 
interval is different for various  sections  unlike the case of 
uniform motion,  the nonuniform motion is characterized by  
average velocity. If  the displacements  s1, ,  s2,...   .sn and time 
intervals t1, t2,.... tn  are known the average velocity of entire 
motion is given by the formula:

§1.4. Acceleration  in  rectilinear motion 
 
Acceleration is the rate at which velocity  changes with time. 
The change in velocity of a body is the difference between its 
final  f  and original velocities   0 . Thus

Magnitude of acceleration is 
equal to  tangent of the angle 
between  graph of velocity and axis 
of time. (Fig.1.5). 
 
a=tg 
 
Thus, the slope  of a speedtime  
graph  represents  acceleration. 
In SI unit of  acceleration is m/ sec 2 .                 Fig.1.5 
                                                                      
                                                                   
 
§ 1. 5. Kinematic  equations 
 
Consider the  special case of a motion that a body  is 
accelerated from rest., i.e. initial velocity    0 = 0.  For this 
motion the distance traveled  at  any given time can be given as

If the velocity of a body is increasing, the acceleration is 
positive ( a  0 ). If the velocity is decreasing, the acceleration is 
negative( a   0 ) . 
The  final velocity   can be expressed  by  
 
 atf        2 a sf       or      2 a x x f 0   ( 1.11 ) 
 
From  Eq. ( 1.9 )  for final velocity of the motion with initial 
velocity  0  we get a general expression 
 
    atf 0  .                             ( 1.12 )

Note,  that if the motion is decelerated  an acceleration in 
formulae ( 1.14 ) and ( 1.15  )   is negative( a   0 ) . At the end of 
decelerated motion the final velocity is zero.(  f  = 0 ).  Then for

 If we decrease the interval of time t, the point B will

§ 1.10.  Uniform  and  nonuniform   
circular  motions 
 
  A body moving on the circle  with  linear velocity constant 
in magnitude makes a uniform motion. In this motion the 
instantaneous speed is directed on the tangent of trajectory at any 
moment of time. In general the acceleration is defined as the rate 
of change of speed. (Fig.1.11).

is directed towards the center of circle. This acceleration refers to

get 
=2 f                                    ( 1. 55 ) 
 
relationship  between the linear and angular velocities is

where  r  is the radius of the circle. 
Note, that angular velocity is defined through the angle of rotation

the centripetal acceleration and angular velocity

If the velocity of  a body  circular motion changes in 
magnitude it will  have both normal and tangential  accelerations. 
Normal and tangential components of acceleration are 
perpendicular to each  other. The total acceleration is the vector 
sum of both accelerations ( Look at Fig.1.11b):

calculated as    
 =

Like linear acceleration the angular acceleration is the rate of 
change in angular velocity. 
 
 
§1. 11. Motion of a horizontally thrown body 
 
This motion is the composition of two independent ones: 
horizontal and vertical.  The motion of the x  projection is the 
motion with zero acceleration 
at a velocity   0. The motion 
of y projection is a free fall 
with an acceleration g under 
the action of the force of 
gravity with zero initial 
velocity.( Fig. 1.12 ) The X  
component remains constant 
and equal to  0.  But the  y 
component grows in 
proportion to time: gt y                              Fig.1.12

§ 1.12. Projectile motion 
 
  Let  us consider the motion of a body thrown upwards at an 
angle    to the horizontal ( Fig.1.13).

constant: 
 
     cos x 0 .                         ( 1.67 )    
         
The y  projection of  velocity varies with  time by the 
formula; 
   g ty 0 y   ,                         ( 1. 68)  
  
where    sin00 y  
From Eqs. ( 1.67 ) and ( 1.68 ) it is quite clear the described 
motion is composed of two independent motions; 
 a)  the horizontal motion with constant velocity ; 
 b) the vertical motion with constant acceleration. At the 
highest point A of the trajectory the velocity has only horizontal 
component, while vertical component reduces with passage of 
time until the body reaches the highest point and becomes zero. 
Hence, equating the expression ( 1.68 ) to zero we get the instant 
tA over which the body reaches the maximum height. 
 
g / sin   t 0A   .                             ( 1.69 )

the body reaches we get:

From formula (  1.71  ) it follows that the height increases 
with angle   and reaches its maximum value equal to  g2/20   at  
an  angle  = 90

From equation ( 1.75 ) the range for a particular initial 
velocity is    maximum when  sin 2 is maximum. The maximum 
value of sin 090 =1   if  2=90 , then  =45  for a maximum 
range at a given initial velocity. For a projectile with a given 
initial velocity, the maximum range is attained with a projection 
angle of  45. For angles above and below 45 the range is shorter 
and equal for equal differences from 45. 
Comparison (1.71) and (1.75) gives

CHAPTER  2 
    
 Dynamics. 
 
 
§2.1. Newtons  laws  of  motion.  
The concept of force 
 
Dynamics  is a branch of mechanics which  study the motion 
of bodies with regard to the reasons of motion. An object at rest 
will not move unless the forces acting on it are no longer in 
equilibrium. An object in motion will not slow down, speed up, or 
change its direction unless a force acts upon it. All changes in the 
motion of objects are due to forces. The five forces known to 
scientists are the gravitational, electric, magnetic, nuclear and 
weak interaction forces. 
Newton’s First Law. Newton’s first law of motion implies 
that there is no fundamental difference between an object at rest 
and one that is moving with uniform velocity. This law of motion 
states; an object continues  its state of rest or  uniform motion 
along a straight line,unless it is compelled upon by an 
unbalanced external force impressed upon it. This law means 
that it is the natural tendency of an object to resist a change in its 
motion. This tendency is called inertia of  a body.  Mass  of 
matter in any body is the quantitative measure of inertia.Mass is 
measured in kilograms kg 
Newton’s Second Law.   Consider a sitation when there is 
either a single applied force or two or more applied forces whose 
vector sum is not zero.  The second law of motion states: “ The 
effect of an applied force on a body is to cause it to accelerate 
 38 
in the direction of he force. The acceleration is  direct 
proportional to  the force and is inversely proportional to the 
mass of the body”. Newtons second law can be written in the 
form 
 
                   amF

   ,                                  ( 2. 1 ) 
 
where F

 is the net force applied on an object, a is the resultant 
acceleration of an object and m is the inertial mass of the object. 
The SI unit of force is newton N. A force of one newton will 
accelerate a 1  kg mass at the rate of 1ms2. 1N=kgms2 
Newton’s Third Law.  When any body exerts by force on the 
second body the second body also exerts by equal force in the 
opposite direction on the first body. 
Third law of motion is also known as the law of action and 
reaction.According to this law a single force can never exit.  
Action of any body on another is always accompained by a 
reaction of the second on the first. Third law of motion states: To 
every action (force) there is always an equal and opposite 
reaction 
 
                          F1 =F2 or    m1a1 = m2a2 .  ,            ( 2. 2 )  
 
where F1 is the force acting on the first body, F2 the force acting 
on the second body,  m1 and m2-the masses of the first and second 
bodies, respectively. Fig.2.1a shows that F1-force exerted by the 
table on hand and F2-force exerted by hand on table.  
Walking is a good example of Newtons third law of 
motion.As we attemt to push the earth away from us, the net force 
exerted on us is the reaction of the ground acting vertically 
upward as a result of our exertion on the ground vertically 
downward minus our weight. If the net force is positive we will be 
able to jump.The reaction of the Earth on our feet  propels us 
forward  Fig.2.1b. 
 39 
 
                                         Fig.2.1 
 
The third law of motion leads to the law of conservation of 
momentum. 
 
§ 2.2. Linear momentum. Impulse.  
Law of   conservation of  linear  momentum  
 
 Momentum of the mass point is a vector quantity, equal to the 
product of the mass and its velocity. 
 
p= m .                                        ( 2. 3 ) 
 
Direction of momentum is the same with the direction of 
velocity. A momentun of the system composed of n mass point is 
equal to the sum of momenta of all masses. 
Momentum is measured in kgms1. 
If the applied forces are constant then 
 
F= m 
t
0            or     Ft = p  p0 .     
     
 The quantity Ft is referred to impulse. Thus a change in 
momentum is equal to the impulse. Here F is the vector sum of 
 40 
internal  and external forces.  The sum of internal forces is equal 
to zero in accordance with the  Newton s third law.  Thus change 
in momentum per unit time is equal to the resultant external force. 
 
 
 p

Fext.   .                                    ( 2. 4 )     
 
Eq. ( 2.4 ) is known as principal equation of dynamics. 
If the system  is isolated, i.e. the system  is acted by no 
exterior force, then p= 0 or p=const.   This is law of conservation 
of momentum.. 
 
 
§ 2. 3. Elastic collision of  balls 
 
First, let us consider perfectly elastic collesion. We assume 
that two balls move along the same straight line along the line 
connecting their centres.  A ball of mass m1 moving with a 
velocity v 1 called the incident  approaches a second ball of mass 
m 2, moving with a velocity v 2 called the target.( Fig.2.2a ) After 
the collision let the velocities of the two balls be    1  and v 2. 
From the law of conservation of momentum it follows that

After rearranging Eqs. (2.5) and (2.6) may be written as (2.7) 
and (2.8) respectively 
 41

   2/222221211   mm  .               (2.8) 
 
 
Dividing Eq. ( 2. 8 ) by ( 2. 7 )  gives: 
 
 1    2 = 2   1                               (2.9) 
 
On the other hand when     21 mm   from ( 2. 5  ) we get: 
 1 +  2=  1  +   v 2                            (2.10) 
 
The sum of the last equations gives  2 =  1   while  their 
difference gives  1=  2  . Thus the balls interchange their  
velocities, the second ball acquires the velocity which the first ball 
had before the collision. If the second ball initially was at rest 
( 2=0) then  1 =0 i.e. the incident ball which was moving with 
velocity v1 comes to rest while the target ball that was at rest 
begins to move with a velocity v 1. Thus the incident ball transfers 
all its kinetic energy to the target ball. 
Relative velocity of the balls with respect to each other before 
collision and after collision has the same magnitude but it is 
reversed after collision. Solving ( 2.7 ) and ( 2.8 ) for   1  and  
 2  gives

 Let us examine these formulas:

 Consider some interesting cases: 
a)  2 = 0,  m1 = m2  In this case we get  1=0 and  1= 
 2,i.e., when one of the balls is at rest the velocity of moving one 
is transferred to another. 
b)   2 = 0,  Suppose m1  m2 In this case from Eq.( 2.12 ) 
we get   1=  1 and  2=2 1 . That is the incident ball keeps on 
moving without losing much energy while the target ball moves 
with a velocity double that of the incident ball. 
c)   2 = 0 Suppose  m 1  m 2  From Eq.( 2.6 ) we see that 
 1=  1 while  2=0  This means that small incident ball just 
bounces off in the opposite direction while the heavy target 
remains almost motionless. 
 
§ 2. 4. Inelastic collision of  balls 
 
In the  case of inelasticity, after collision the two bodies move 
together with a certain velocity  .( Fig.2.2b). 
 43 
 
                                        Fig.2.2 
 Suppose that a body of mass m 1   has a velosity  1  and a 
body of mass m2  has a velosity   2  before collision. 
According to the law of  conservation of momentum

Thus, from ( 2.14 ) we see that a decrease in mechanical energy 
causes the increase  in internal energy of a system of two bodies. 
 
§ 2. 5.  Jet   propulsion 
 
Consider an action of.a rocket   in result of conbustion of fuel. 
The gases heated up high temperature are thrown out from the  of 
rocket’s  tail with speed  .  A rocket and gases thrown out by its 
 44 
engine   are interracting.  In accordance with the conservation of 
momentum in the absence of external forces the vector sum  of 
momenta of interacting bodies remains constant. Untill starting  
into operation  momenta of both  rocket and fuel are equal to zero. 
Hence, the  vector sum of momentums of rocket and gases expired 
must be equal  zero  when engines are going into operation as 
well. 
 
M V

 + m

 = 0 
 
where  M  is the mass of rocket, V  is the rocket s velocity , 
 m is the mass of thrown out gases,      is the speed of the 
expiration of gases. 
Hence we get  
M V

= -  m

  
 
This formula is used for the calculation the rocket’s speed 
when a change in its mass  M is negligible. 
The gases being pulled out from tail of rocket act on it with a 
certain force , called jet force of draft. In order to find it we use 
the basic equation of dynamics ( 2. 4 ). We shall divide both sides 
by t. If taking into account that  M 


 V
 t
F  represents the jet 
force of draft and =

  is the  fuel charge per unit time . 
Hence it follows 
 
F =  v                                  ( 2. 15 ) 
 
Thus, jet force of draft is directly proportional to the fuel 
charge per  second and speed of gases; it is directed in opposite 
direction to the gas expiration. 
The stock of fuel is calculated by the formula  
 45 
 
M fuel =  t                               ( 2. 16 ) 
where t is the time. 
 
  
§ 2. 6.   Keplers  laws 
 
Kepler’s first law:  The orbits of the planets are ellipses one 
focus of which is located on the Sun (Fig.2.3 a ). 
Kepler’s second law: A planet moves so that the imaginary 
line between it and the Sun sweeps out equal areas in equal time 
intervals. 
In Fig.2.3b  two areas A and B are 
equal. In the equal intervals of time the 
planet can go from point 1 to 2 or from 
3 to 4. 
Third law:  A square of ratio of 
periods need to make a revolution 
around the Sun and ratio of average 
distances from the Sun are equal for 
any two planets. 
This result can be obtained by 
equating the centripetal force and the  
force of attraction between the Sun for 
any planet . For pair  of arbitrary 
planets we can write: 
 
                                                                       Fig..2.3

§ 2. 7. The Law of Universal Gravitation 
 
The force of gravity on the Earth’s surface gives an 
acceleration g=9.80 m/sec2 to all bodies. How to calculate the  
centripetal acceleration of Moon?. The Moon moves around 
the Earth on the circular orbit. Radius of orbits is appoximately 
equal  385000 km,and period of revolution T is 27.3  day    or 
2358720 sec. Then the speed of this motion is  
 
T/r 2  =1.02x10 3 .sec/m   
 
Consequently, ac.=  2/ r = 2.73x10  3 ms2  or ac   2.78x104            
g which is the same as ac   (1/3600)g . 
Thus, the acceleration of Moon directed toward the Earth is  
1/3600 part of acceleration on the surface of the Earth.A distance 
between Moon and Earth is 385000km.,which is greater  as 60 
times  than the  radius of Earth, equal to 6380 km. This means that 
Moon is far from the center of Earth by 60 time in comparison 
with the body on the Earth. Newton had a conclusion that 
gravitational force decreases as the inverse square of the distance 
from the Earths center.Kepler’s first law supported this 
conclusion,  since a force of this kind can only lead to a circular or 
elliptical motion. The weight mg of the body,which is the force of 
gravity uponit,is always proportional to its mass m. Newton s third 
law of motion requaires that,if the earth attracts body, the body 
 47 
also attracts the earth. If the earth s attraction for  an apple 
depends upon apple s mass, then the reaction force exerted by the 
apple on the earth depends upon the earth s mass.Hence the 
graviational force between two bodies is proportional to both of 
their masses.Thus, Newton summarized the above conclusions in 
a single form: Every body in the universe attracts every other 
body with a force proportional to both of their masses and 
inversely proportional to the square of the distance between 
them. 
Force of attraction between two objects is directed along the 
line connecting those objects ( Fig.2.4a). 
 
                                    Fig.2.4

According to ( 2. 19 )  the free fall acceleration is

G  and    is the Earths density. Hence it 
follows that g is directly proportional to the radius of the Earth up 
to the surface of latter. 
If a body with mass m will be at  the height h above Earth’s 
surface, then from  ( 2. 21 )  we  get 
 
g h=GME / R+h
2                         ( 2. 24 ) 
 
The dependences    ( 2. 23 )    and ( 2. 24 ) are demonstrated in 
Fig.2.4b 
 
§ 2.8. Variation  of acceleration due to gravity  
with latitude 
 
The body on the Earth s surface lying at latitude  moves 
with angular velocity .Now consider, how is the acceleration due 
to gravity depends on position of the body on the Earth s surface. 
 49 
As can be seen from Fig.2.4c  the resultant of two forces gives  the 
body a centripetal acceleration a=2 R. Then   
 
mgN=m2R                           ( 2. 25 ) 
 
Where R is the Earths radius, Nis the support s reactional 
force,   is the Earth s angular velocity. If  the support is taken 
and the body  is given the free fall possibility, then  it will move 
under action of force, determined with acceleration at equator:  
Feq=mgeq. Then the equation  ( 2. 25 )  takes  the form:  
mg  m2R = mgeq.     or     geq= g 2R 
 
where g is the l acceleration of free fall without regard to the 
Earth s rotation around  its axis. 
Similarly for another parallel circles corresponding to  
various angles     we get  
 
g = g  2r                             ( 2. 26 ) 
 
Since in Fig .2.4c   r =Rcos , then  
 
 g = g 2Rcos   or  g = g  42/ T2 cos .          ( 2. 27 )

Taking the Earth to be a uniform sphere, an observer at depth 
x below the surface is inside a sphere of radius R and thickness  x, 
so that the attraction due to this part of the Earths mass is zero.

From Eq.( 2. 29 ) can be seen that at the centre of the Earth 
(x=RE) gx=0. Hence as we go below the surf  ace of the earth, the 
value of g decreases. 
 
§ 2.10.   Cavendishs  experiment 
 
The value of the gravitational constant G is found 
experimentally by Cavendish. A light rod is suspended from its 
centre by means of fine quarts fibre as shown in (Fig.2.5). 
 Two identical balls each of mass  m are  suspended from the end 
of  the thread. When  heavy  balls  each  of mass M are  brought  
near them  on opposite sides of the small balls, they exert   forces  
of  attraction   on  the suspended  balls. Each of these forces has 
 51 
magnitude   G
Mm
r2
 .  where  r  is the distance between  the  
centres  of   the  balls  M  and  m.  These   forces                        
produced torque  which  causes   the  fibre  to  twist. The  twist  
produced in the fibre is proportional to 
the magnitude of the torque that is, 
 
=c                               (2. 30 ) 
 
where c is the torsion constant of the 
fibre which can be calculated by 
applying a known torque and    is the 
angle through which the fibre is twisted. 
   If  l   is the length of the rod then the 
magnitude of the torque due to

reflected from the small mirror attached to the fibre. The lamp and 
scale arrangement is used to measure the angle of twist accurately. 
    All the quantities in the above equation except G, are known. 
The value of G found from this experiment is  
 G=6.673x1011Nm2kg2.  
 
§2.11. The weight of  an object  
 
 52 
The force with which a body experiences the force of gravity 
acting on a support or a suspender is called the weight  of an 
object.  
The weight may be  distinguished from the force of gravity 
attraction and is the force acting on the connection. Naturally 
weight is the force of elasticity.The weight may be equal to the 
force of gravity, when 
 the body will be at rest relatively to the Earth, 
 the body will be in the inertial reference frames. 
 If the lift moves upward or downward with constant 
acceleration the weight observed in it will differ from that the 
force of gravity. Let R be the force of reaction and P be the weight 
of the body. Consider the motion of lift  for the following  cases: 
 1. Suppose, that the vectors of velocity v and acceleration a 
are directed downward opposite direction of z axis ( Fig.2.6a,. 
 
                                              Fig.2.6 
  Then 
 
RP=ma   or   R=m ga                    ( 2.33 ) 
 
2.Direction of velocity is downward, but acceleration is 
directed upwards ( Fig.2.6b, ;  
 
RP=ma  or  R=m g+a                       ( 2. 34 ) 
 
3. Both velocity and acceleration are directed upward 
 53 
 ( Fig.2.6c,  :  
RP=ma  or  R=m g+a                       ( 2.35 )  
 
4.Direction of    is upward  but  acceleration is directed  
downward ( Fig.2.6d  : 
  
RP = ma  or  R= mga                    ( 2. 36 ) 
 
Weight of  an object  P equals in magnitude and opposite in 
direction to the force of reaction R . 
5. Weight of an object upon its motion over convex and 
concave paths  ( Fig.2.7) are given by the formulas respectively; 
 
                    gmP ( 
r
2
) ,     )(g 
2
r
mP

  
Thus, if the body moves in non-inertial reference frames the 
weight differs from the force of gravity. An apparent weight is less 
 
                                       
Fig.2.7 
 
than the gravitational force on the body.When a=g then P is equal 
to zero. It is called the state of weightlessness. In this case motion 
is the free fall.The above described second and third cases are 
known as overload. Since the free falling acceleration  varies at 
different points of the Earths  surface the weight of the same body 
will be various at different points of the Earths surface. 
When a body is in horizontally accelerated motion its weight 
is  expressed by

§ 2.12.  Cosmic  velocities 
 
A body starting from any point with definite velocity revolves 
over circular trajectory around the Earth. The velocity of such 
motion is called first cosmic velocity and is directed horizontally.       
A cosmic  rocket moving over circular orbit nearly the Earth s 
surface is acted by two forces: centripetal and force of gravity. 
According the Newton s second law

The velocity with which a rocket may leave the gravitational 
field of Earth and become the  artificial planet is known as the 
second cosmic velocity  2 .  Expression for the second cosmic 
velocity we get in accordance with the law of conservation of 
energy. In this case a distance between artificial planet and Earth 
can be accepted equal to infinite . Thus

In this case trajectory is the parabola.  
If the velocity has the range      <   <    1 2  the trajectory 
represents  an ellipse which nearly focus is located at the centre of 
Earth. 
When velocity is greater than the second cosmic velocity 
   >   2  the trajectory  becomes hyperbola  
At least, if the    <   1  , then trajectory is the ellipse, farther 
focus which coincides with the centre of the Earth.  
 
§ 2.13. Elasticity. Force of elasticity 
  
Elasticity is defined as that property of matter by virtue of 
which it tends to return to its original shape or size after any 
change of shape or size. A force can deform the body, i.e. displace 
the components of its parts relative other. Then arrising the 
oppositional force equal in magnitude to deforming one is called a 
force of elasticity. These forces are due to interaction between 
particles and have nature of electricity. 
Strain.   A strain is given by the equation:  
 
=
Change of length



                    ( 2. 41 ) 
 
Stress is defined as the internal force per unit of cross  
sectional area on which the force acts. It tends to resist the 
 56 
external load. For the specimen under consideration stress is 
expressed as  
           =
F
S
                                        ( 2. 42 ) 
 
Stress is measured in  ( N/ m 2  ) or in Pa. 
Elastic limit. The maximum stress a substance will bear and 
yet return to its original shape or size when the load is removed is 
known as  its elastic limit. In Fig.2.8  OA represents the 
proportionality  limit of the specimen. The section AB is residence 
deformation. Magnitude of stress corresponding to point B is the 
elastic limit. Section CD indicate fluidity. Under stress closed to 
point K a specimen can be broken. 
In general, any change in shape or size is called a deformation.  
The following types of deformation are 
known: extension, compression, shear,  
bending and torsion. However, any 
deformation can ultimately be reduced to 
two simple types: extension and shear. 
Consider deformation of extension . The 
change  in length is expressed            
     Fig.2.8

where S the cross-sectional area of the specimen, E  is the 
Youngs  modulus and   0l  is the original length.                                            
Fig.2.8                               
Expression  ( 2.43 ) can be rewritten as  
 
F= k  0l                                     ( 2. 44 ) 
where

 Further substituting ( 2.43 ) and ( 2.44 ) into  ( 2. 42 ) we get 
 
 = E                                   ( 2. 45 ) 
 
Last expression is the Hooke s law, whicih states:  Up to the 
elastic limit, stresses are proportional to their corresponding 
strains.  
Mechanical stress produces also the transverse compression. 
Cross- sectional area of a body changes due to its  longitudinal 
changing. This sort of deformation is characterised by Poussin s

 = G                                       ( 2. 47 ) 
 
where     the tangent stress, G  modulus of shear and     
shear deformation . The relation among these quantitues and

§ 2.14.  Frictional  forces 
 
A forces  appearing in bodies contacting in direct are called 
frictional forces. Frictional forces are dividing in following kinds: 
1.external,2.internal,3.static, 4.sliding, 5.rolling 
 58 
1.  First consider the static friction. Suppose, that the body is 
not at rest on the surface of horizontal plane . If we slightly 
increase the external force F , then the body still does not move. 
This means, that static friction has increased together with F  as 
well. If we increase F still further the body will ultimately start to 
move along the plane. It means, that force of static friction has its 
maximum and this maximum is less than the applied external 
force F. Thus, static friction is equal and opposite to the external 
force. Static friction depends on the force of reaction, with which 
bodies in contact press against each other. If denote the coefficient 
of static friction by   0 we can write; 
 
Fs.f.=  0 N                              ( 2. 49 )  
 
where N is the force of reaction. 
Coefficient of static friction depends on the nature of material. 
2.  Now let consider the sliding friction. If the two bodies in 
contact are in motion relative to each other then the arising force 
of friction is called sliding. The external force needed for sliding 
of  the body on the plane is less than the force required to move 
the body on the plane. For the case of sliding friction  we have: 
 
F sl. f.=  1 N                              ( 2. 50 ) 
 
where 1 is the coefficient of sliding friction. Coefficient  1 
depends on the nature and quality of surfaces in contact and the 
velocity of motion. 
3.  To demonstrate the role of rolling fricion let us take the 
cylinder on the horizontal plane. It is not difficult to see that the 
external force required to shift the cylinder from the state of rest 
and to move is much smaller than that required for sliding this 
cylinder without rolling. Thus, rolling friction is much smaller 
than sliding frict ion.: Force of rolling friction is expressed as  
 
 59 
F R.f.=  2 
N
R
                            ( 2. 51 ) 
 
where R is the radius of the rolling body. Finally, note that relation 
among these coefficients of friction is as following: 
 
 2   1   0    
 
 
 
 
 
§ 2.15.  Motion over an inclined plane 
 
The plane is called inclined, which forms a certain angle  with 
the horizontal. To describe this motion we must decomposite the 
force of gravity in two components F1 and F2 as in Fig.2.9. 
 
F1=mgsin ; 
       F2=mgcos                    (2.52) 
 
where    is the angle of repose. Since  
F2 =N ( the force of planes surface 
reaction ) the frictional force                                   Fig.2.9                                                                        
                                                                              
Ffrict. = R=mgcos                         ( 2. 53 ) 
 
If the friction is absent then body left to itself would slide 
down the plane.In order to hold the body some other force should 
be applied to it. 
If a frictional force Ffrict.,  there is only  then moving to 
become of body in states of rest or  move depends on the ratio 
 60 
between forces F1 (directed downwards) and Ffrict.: there are some 
cases: 
a) If  F1  Ffrict.,, the body is at rest 
b) If  F1 =Ffrict. the body is in  uniform motion. 
c) If F1  Ffrict.  the body is in uniform  accelerated motion. 
 
a=g( sin      cos )                          ( 2. 54 ) 
 
Consider the following cases: 
1.  Force of tension  is equal  to zero. 
a) Accelerated  downward motion. 
 
a=g ( sin      cos )                         ( 2. 55 ) 
 
b) Decelerated  downward.motion 
 
a=g( cos       sin)                               ( 2. 56 ) 
 
2. Force of tension  differs from zero: 
a) Accelerated  upward motion 
 
ma=T  mgsin     mgcos                      ( 2.57 ) 
 
b) Accelerated  downward motion  
 
ma= mgsin    mgcos  T                      ( 2.58) 
 
c) Decelerated  upward motion 
 
ma= mgsin + mgcos   T                      ( 2.59 ) 
 
d) Decelerated  downward motion 
 
ma= T  mgsin   mgcos                       ( 2.60 )

CHAPTER  3 
   
 Statics 
 
 
§3.1. Rest and equilibrium 
 
 
Statics deals with the problems concerning the motion of 
bodies, from point of view of equilibrium conditions. To solve 
some of problems on engineering constructions such as bridges, 
inclined planes, we must know equilibrium conditions for forces. 
First  consider the difference between  rest and equilibrium;  
A body is said to be in state of rest when its velocity is zero 
                 Rest;       = 0  for  translational  motion, 
 ( 3. 1 ) 
                                = 0   for  rotational  motion. 
 
A body is said to be in a state of equilibrium when its 
acceleration is zero 
                 Equilibrium;   a = 0   for  translational  motion,  
( 3. 2 ) 
                                            = 0   for rotational  motion 
 
A body may be at rest without being in equilibrium or it may 
be in equilibrium without being at rest. 
 
 
 62 
3.2. First condition of equilibrium 
 
  We consider equilibrium condition for  a body without a fixed axis. 
a) The sum of all forces upward must be equal to the sum of 
the forces downward. 
     Writing this fact by an equation for five forces F1,  F2 ,  F3 , F4 , 
and  F5  applied on the body as shown in Fig. 3.1 
     F1y    + F2y  + F3y = F4y + F5y. 
 
Transposing gives 
 
     F1y + F2y + F3y   F4y  F5y = 0. 
 
Hence the equation may be 
written in the briefer form; 
 
 Fy=0 .                ( 3. 3 ) 
                                                    Fig.3.1 
b ) The sum of the forces to right must equal the sum of the 
forces to left 
                    F4x + F5x = F1x + F2x + F3x  . 
Transposing 
                    F4x+ F5x  F1x  F2x  F3x= 0     or 
 
                      Fx = 0                               ( 3. 4 ) 
 
In the case of motion in space we would take a third, or z-axis 
perpendicular to the X  and Y axes; it would then be necessary 
also that 
                       Fz = 0                                ( 3. 5 ) 
 
Thus,  conditions (3. 3), ( 3.4)  and (3.5) may be extended to 
any number of forces acting on a body. 
 
 63 
§3.3. Equilibrium of a body due to  action  
of three forces 
 
Lamis theorem;  When a body is held in equilibrium by three 
forces, each force is proportional to the sine of the angle between 
the other two forces: 
 
                      F1 :  F2 : F3  = sin   :  sin   :  sin  1 2 3    .   ( 3. 6 ) 
 
If a body is in equilibrium under the action of three forces 
1. The forces must be lie in a plane. 
2. The forces must meet in a point. The force polygon must be 
a closed triangle. 
 
 
§3.4. Torque  or  moment  of  force 
 
 The product of the magnitude of force  F and the distance      
from the axis to the line of action of 
the force is known as the torque or  
moment of force. The remembered 
distance is called the arm of force. 
Denoting the moment of force by  M, 
we can write 
 
            lFM

                     ( 3. 7 ) 
 
       It can be seen from Fig. 3.2  that                    Fig.3.2 
 l = r sin  and r is the position vector.   
Then we can write  
 
 
                                                 
 
 64 
       M  =rF   ;       M= rF  ;       M=
 sin
F
sin
F  
rl
             ( 3.8 ) 
 
 where  F=Fsin  is the component of F perpendicular to r and 
r= r sin is the component of r perpendicular to F.  If   angle  is 
equal to zero or , then no perpendicular component of F exists 
i.e., F=Fsin= 0, so the line of action of force F passes through 
the origin and the moment arm  r   about the origin is zero. In this 
case equations ( 3. 8  )  implie  that the torque M is zero. 
 
             
§3.5. Second condition of equilibrium.  
A body with a fixed axis 
 
We consider equilibrium condition for a body with a fixed axis. 
If a body does not rotate or rotates with a constant angular 
velocity. the body is said to be in 
rotational equilibrium. When a 
torque is applied to a body about an 
axis, it produces a rotation in it. So 
the second condition of equilibrium 
is stated as follows:  A body will be 
in rotational equilibrium only if the 
sum of all the external torques  acting                    Fig.3.3                              
on the body about any arbitrary axis is zero. 
 
0 M + ....  M M n21 

                         ( 3. 9 ) 
 
Consider two forces F1  and F2  applied to a body as shown in 
Fig.3.3.The force F1 produces counter clockwise torque   M1= 11lF   
while F2   produces anticlockwise torque M2 =  22 lF     about an 
axis through O along Z axis. For this body to be in rotational 
equilibrium                                              
 65 
M1 + M2 =  2211 F  llF   = 0  ;    2211 F llF         (3.10) 
 
This formula expresses the lever rule.  
Thus, for the equilibrium of a body with a fixed axis it is 
necessary that the product of the magnitude of the force and the 
distance between the axis and the line of action of force be the 
same for the two forces. 
 
 
§3.6. Addition of forces   
along the same straight   line 
 
If two forces  act along the same line, then resultant force is 
equal in magnitude to the sum or differencein dependence of 
their directions of the forces F1 and F2 are directed as a  larger 
force. 
 
     FR = F1 +F2             or           FR=F 1  F2      ( 3. 11 ) 
 
 
§3.7. Forces with  the same  and different points 
of application 
 
If the two forces were applied to the same point, their resultant  
force is defined with the rule of parallelogram. The resultant force 
is equal to the diagonal of parallelogram , which sides are the 
given forces. From  Fig.3.4a   it follows that  
                                              
 
F F F F FR   1

where         the angle between the forces F1 and F2.

If the  forces are perpendicular, i.e.   90, then

In  order to find the resultant of two forces shown as in 
Fig.3.4b  we must continue lines of action until they will meet at 
the same point. Then we may use the parallelogram rule.  
 
§3.8. Addition  of  parallel  and anti-parallel  
forces. Force couple 
 
 The resultant force  FR  is 
equal in magnitude to the sum of 
the forces  F1  and   F2  if we 
neglect the mass of the lever.  
From equilibrium condition for 
the lever we get  in  Fig.3.5 
                                                                      Fig.3.5

Thus, the resultant o two parallel forces is equal to the sum of 
the forces, has the same direction and is applied at a point dividing 
the distance between the points of application of forces in inverse 
proportion to the applied forces. 
 
 
 
The resultant of two anti-parallel forces is equal to the

vector sum of the forces, have the same direction as the larger  
force and is applied at a point dividing the distance between the 
points of application of  forces in inverse proportion to the forces 
of which it is composed ( Fig.3.6a )

Two equal and anti-parallel forces not laying on the same 
straight line is called the force couple.  When the  couple act on a 
free body then it will  produce a rotation about the axis, passing 
through  point, which is known as the centre of gravity. From the  
Fig. 3.6b    the resultant moment  M of couple is 
 68 
M = Fl , 
 
where distance   l =  AO + OB, O is the point, from which an axix  
passes. 
 
§3.9.  Decomposition of forces 
 
 In order to de-composite the force it is needed to know the 
direction or magnitude of components. From Fig. 3.7 it can be 
seen that

In case, when the given force is to 
be decomposited in two perpendicular 
components, i.e.     90 and sin 
= cos,  from equations ( 3. 16  ) we 
get: 
 
F =Fsin =Fcos      and    
 F = Fcos=Fsin   .        ( 3. 17 )                          Fig.3.7 
 
 
§3.10.  Center of mass 
 
Consider a particle having mass m. Its weight is acting 
towards the centre of the Earth. An extended object may be 
considered as composed of a large number of such small 
particles.(Fig.3.8a) Each constituent particle of the extended 
object is acted upon by a force directed toward the centre of the 
earth. Since the size of the extended object is very small as 
compared to that of the earth, the acceleration due to gravity may 
be taken as uniform over it. Therefore each particle of the object  
 69 
 
 
Fig.3.8 
 
experiences the same force and these forces on the various 
particles are parallel to each other and are in the same direction. 
Hence their resultant is given by their algebraic sum., is called the 
weight. The point through which the resultant Mg passes is called 
the centre of gravity.  
Since g is nearly uniform over the extended object, it can be 
concluded from W=Mg that the masses of the constituent particles 
can be replaced by the total mass of the object at its center of 
gravity in a uniform gravitational field. This point is also known 
as the centre of mass. It must be remembered that if the 
gravitational field is not uniform over the extended object or 
system of point masses, the centre of gravity and centre of mass 
will not coincide. The centre of gravity is called the point about 
which the sum of moments of the forces of gravity acting on all 
the particles of the body is equal to zero. The expression for the 
position  vector R of the centre of gravity has the form: 
                                      
R =

nn2211
m+mm


                 ( 3. 18 ) 
 
where   m1 ,  m2  ...m n  are the masses. and  r1  ,  r2 .....   r n are the 
position vectors of the particles. When the particles of the body 
are considered to be distributed along a straight line, for example 
x  axis we get the following expression for the position of the 
centre of gravity.

  .                ( 3. 19 ) 
 
 Here x1 , x 2 ... xn are the coordinates of the particles . 
In particular, in case of  two dimensions   for the system of two 
bodies  (Fig.3.8b) we can write: 
 
x
m x m x

 .        ( 3.20 ) 
 
 In these formulas masses are used instead of weights since the 
acceleration of the gravitational force cancels out. Then we can 
conclude that the point found has an objective significance that 
does not depend on the gravitational conditions of  
weightlessness. Thus we speak of the centre o inertia or centre of 
mass of a body instead of its centre of gravity. 
An accurate method for determination  the centre of mass of a 
flat plate is to suspend it in turn from points A, B, and C as shown 
in Fig.3.8c  so that it hangs freely in each case. If a plumb line is 
hung from the same support and lines are drawn to indicate the 
vertical position of the thread, then the point of intersection of the 
lines gives the centre of mass of the plate. The positions of the 
centre of mass of some familiar objects are given below:

§3.11. Types of equilibrium 
 
Equilibrium of a body is called stable if after a small 
displacement of a body from original position are appeared forces 
or moments of forces  returning the body to its original position. 
In the stable equilibrium the  potential energy  of a body is a 
minimum,  and for any overtoaching motion its center of mass  
raises upward( Fig 3.9 a )  
 
Fig.3.9 
 
 If the forces or moments of forces which return the body after 
very small shock to its  original position  are not appeared then the 
body will no longer stay nearly the original position and this 
equilibrium is called unstable. Its potential energy is a maximum, 
for any motion  its centre of mass falls down ( Fig.3.9 b ) 
If  the body is at rest on a horizontal support a displacement of 
the body does not disturb its equilibrium at all,  since the force 
exerted by the plane on the body and the force of gravity balance 
each other in any position of the body. Such an equilibrium is 
known as neutral, or indifferent equilibrium. Its potential energy 
is the same in all positions, and the height of its centre of mass 
remains unchanged (Fig.3.9 c). 
Criterion of stability.  A body will be in a condition of stable 
equilibrium provided the line of action of the resultant of the 
 72 
forces upon it falls within its base, and any motion tends to raise 
its center of mass.

From Fig. 3.10   it  follows, that

where P  the force of gravity,  PN  the perpendicular ( normal ) 
component of P to the inclined plane, s  the length of base of

§3.13. Pulleys 
 
Usually two types of pulleys 
are distinguished: fixed and 
moveable pulleys. The fixed 
pulley allows to change only the 
direction of the applied force as is 
shown in Fig. 3.11a. 
An acceleration of system of 
loads   can be calculated as

where   1m  and  2m  represent the sum of mass weighted on the 
left and right hand  sides of pulley respectively, g  is the 
acceleration due to gravity. 
The moveable pulley gives a gain in force. When a moveable 
pulley is at rest or in uniform rotation the sum of all the applied 
forces and the sum of all the torques is equal to zero. From 
Fig.3.11b   it follows  P=2F  and hence

CHAPTER  4 
 
Work, power and energy 
 
 
§4.1.  Work 
 
   When work is done, the force that does the work is the net 
force. If the force is applied to an object at an angle with the 
direction of motion, the net force is the 
component of the force that acts in the 
direction of motion  (Fig.4.1 )                                                          
Work is done  when an object 
moves  some distance due to an 
applied force. General expression for 
the work done is given as                                    Fig.4.1                      
 
W=Fs cos                                ( 4.1 ) 
 
Here    is the angle between vectors of  displcement and  
force. The product  scos   is the projection of  displcement in 
the direction of the force. Denoting this projection by  sF , we  get 
another expression for the work 
 
W= FsF                                   ( 4.2 ) 
 
When  directions of  force and displacement coincide, work is 
found  by the product of  magnitudes of the force F and 
displacement   s 
 
 75 
 W=Fs                                      ( 4.3 ) 
 
If the force and displacement are at right angle ( = 90 ) to 
each other, the work done  is zero ( W= 0 ). 
 The work of gravitational force is  calculated by

where  r1  and r2 are  position vectors and charcterise the 
initial and final positions of  moving object.  
If the distance between points increases the work is negative 
(W  0, r 2  r 1), and when move toward each other is positive. 
( W  0, r 2  r 1 ) . 
If the trajectory of the point mass  is closed  (r1 = r2) then the  
work done is  zero. 
When a mass m is removed from the Earths surface up to 
height  h  smaller than  the Earth s radius the work is defined by  
 
 W= mgh  .                              ( 4. 5 ) 
 
The work  done by the  frictional force  is calculated  by 
 
W=  RS   ,                           ( 4. 6 ) 
 
where  R  the force of reaction and  is the coefficient of friction. 
When a body moves upwards ower the inclined plane work  done 
is  opposed to the gravitational and frictional forces. In this case 
the work done is given by the formula: 
 
W=mgs ( sin  +  cos  )  ,                 ( 4. 7 ) 
 
where s is the length of the inclined plane. 
 76 
When a constant torque M acts through an angle  in 
rotational motion the work done is 
 
W= M   .                                ( 4. 8 )

The SI unit of work is the work done by the force of one 
newton over the displacement of  one meter. This unit is  known 
as a joule  J .   ( 1 J = 1 N x 1 m ) 
 
§4.2.  Power 
 
   The power is a physical quantity, equal the ratio of work 
done by the time  interval 
 
t
W
=P  .                           ( 4. 11 ) 
 
When power is constant the work is 
calculated as the area of rectangle                 
between the power graph and the time 
axis (Fig.4.2).                                                          Fig.4.2

Having put (4.3) into (4.11)  and taking into account  =s/t for 
power gives 
 
 F=P   .                           ( 4. 12 )  
 
If the directions of velocity and the force coincide, the power 
is equal to  the force multipiled by the velocity  of the point of 
application of the  force. In particular, for the power, developed by 
the motor of machine we have

where  f  - is the frequency, M=Fr  the torque, and r  is the 
radius of pulley. 
Power is measured in watts ( Wt ). A watt is one joule per 
second: 1 Wt = 1 J / (1 sec. ) 
 
 
 
§4.3.  Potential  and   kinetic energies 
 
 Energy is a physical quantity characterising the ability of a 
body to do work. When a body changes its state the energy 
changes as well. 
Energy is measured in the units of work, viz. in joules. In 
mechanics are considered two type of energy: potential and 
kinetic.   
Potential energy is determined only by the position of the 
body. A body lifted above the Earths surface has a potential 
energy, equal to the product of the force of gravity and the height 
to which it has been lifted. For the height very smaller as 
compared to  the Earths radius the  potential energy is expressed 
as  
 
 78 
EP =m g h .                             ( 4. 14 ) 
 
When the height h can be compared with the Earth s radus  
R E the acceleration due to gravity g depends on the distance. Then 
dependence of mg versus the h will have the form as illustrated in 
Fig.4.3a When g is constant the EP  is equal in magnitude to the 
area of polygon  shown in Fig.4.3b.

EP =k

2
 ,                           ( 4. 15 ) 
 
where x   is the change of length of the specimen and  k  is the 
coefficient of elasticity or spring constant. 
Kinetic energy.   Any moving body has a certain ability to do 
work, i.e. a certain energy due to its motion, which is called a 
kinetic energy. Consider as an exsample of an object of mass m 
resting on a frictionless surface. A constant force F acts on it 
through a displacement s  . The force will accelerate the object in 
accordance with Newton’s second law of motion F= ma. If we 
multiply both sides of this equation by  s  , the left side of the 
equation represents work  done on the mass.

Fs = mas                                ( 4. 16 ) 
 
The speed of an object starting from rest is given by  2 =2as  
(see 1.19) This expression can be rearranged to read  as = 2 /2

                           ( 4. 17 ) 
 
The expression  ( 4.17 ) relates the work done on the mass to 
its resulting speed. The right hand side of the equation states the 
amount of work mass m  moving with velocity   can do as it is 
brought to rest. The energy  the object has because of its velocity 
equals the work that was done to give the mass its velocity. Thus, 
the quantity  m  2 / 2 is called the kinetic energy E K of the object.

§4.4. Law of conservation  of mechanical energy 
 
The total mechanical energy of the body is the sum of its 
kinetic and potential energies. The law of conservation of energy 
states that the total energy of a system cannot change, unless work 
is done on the system. Within an isolated system energy can 
change from one form to another, but the total amount of energy 
always remains the same: 
 
.min,.max, pktotal EEE                         (4.20) 
.max,.min, pktotal EEE                         (4.21) 
 
 Energy can never be lost by a system. Let us consider the free 
falling motion of a body. In Fig.4.5a are given time dependencies 
of  kinetic an potential energies. The dependencies of these  
energies  versus the height are shown in Fig.4.5b.  It is seen that in 
both cases a decreasing in potential energy causes an equal 
increase in kinetic energy. 
 
                                          Fig.4.5 
 
As can be seen from Fig.4.5a  kinetic energy increases ,but 
potential energy decreases with time upon free fall.

Work, power and energy 
          
4.1. Work 
 
   When work is done, the force that does the work is the net 
force. If the force is applied to an object at an angle with the 
direction of motion, the net force is the component of the force 
that acts in the direction of motion ( Fig.4.1 ) Work is done  when 
an object moves some distance due to an applied force. The 
general expression for work is written in the form 
 
W=Fs cos                                ( 4.1 ) 
 
Here    is the angle between directions of the displacement 
and the force. The product  scos   is the projection of the 
displacement in the direction of the force. Denoting this projection 
by  s F , we  get another expression for work 
 
W= F s F                                   ( 4.2 ) 
 
When the directions of the force and displacement coincide  
, work is equal to the product of the magnitudes of the 
force F and displacement   s 
 
 W=Fs                                      ( 4.3 ) 
 
The work becomes negatively when vectors of force and 
displacement are  in opposite directions.  
If the force and displacement are at right angle ( = 90 ) to 
each other, the work done by the force is zero ( W= 0 ). 
 82 
Work one is related to the change in both kinetic and potential 
energies: 
                        ( 4.4 ) 
                 (4.5) 
Equation  (  ) expresses the  work- energy theorem. The net 
work done is equal to the change in kinetic energy. This theorem  
is applied to all kinds of forces. 
Equation (  ) is applied to the potential forces ( force of 
gravity, force of elasticity and Coulomb’s forces) only. 
Work done by forces of gravity and elasticity is independent 
on the  object’s path , therefore work done along the closed path is 
zero. Such force known as conservative forces.

For   downward motion:

Work done by the force of gravity is defined  by   
for both  uniform and accelerated (decelerated) motions. 
However work done by tractive force  is defined by  
   (upward motion) 
   (downward motion) 
 The work of gravitational force is  determined as

r1  and r2 are position vectors and characterize the initial and 
final positions of removing point.  
If the distance between points increases the work is negative 
(W  0, r 2  r 1), and when the points approach the work done is 
positive.( W  0, r 2  r 1 ) 
 83 
If the trajectory over which the point is removed is closed (r1 
= r2) the work is equal zero. 
 
The work  done by the  force  of friction is calculated as  
 
W=  NS                                ( 4. 7 ) 
where N  the force of reaction and  is the coefficient of friction. 
When a body moves upward on the inclined plane work  done is  
opposite to the gravitational and frictional forces. In this case the 
work done is expressed by the formula: 
 
W=  ( sin  +  cos  )                   ( 4. 8 ) 
 
where    is the length of the inclined plane. 
 
Example 4.1:  A 50 kg mass is uniformly  lifted  over the 
inclined plane,  with  60 cm  height, 2 m length and   
efficiency. What force was used? 
Given:  
             
                                          Find:   F 
             
              
Solution: Since for the inclined plane  a useful work  output is the 
work done by the force of gravity and work input is work done 
along the inclined plane then efficiency is given by 
 
     
  
Solving this formula for  F  gives 
 
      
 84 
Answer:    
 
When a constant torque M acts through an angle  in 
rotational motion the work done  is given as 
 
W= M                                   ( 4. 9 )

approaches to the equilibrium state  the    decrease and  
 
 
The ratio of useful work to the total work is called the 
mechanical efficiency 
 
          (4.11) 
 
 
The SI unit of work is the work done by the force of one 
newton over the displacement of  one meter. This unit is  known 
as a joule ( J ).    1 J = 1 N x 1 m 
 
 
 
 
 
4.2.  Power 
 
 85 
    Power is the rate of doing work. The average power is the 
work done divided by the time it takes to do the work, or work per 
unit time: 
                               ( 4. 12 ) 
 
When power is constant the work is calculated as the area of 
rectangle between the power graph and the time axis (Fig.4.3). 
When force is constant  we can take into consideration the 
formula W=Fs  and  the ration  S / t  represents  velocity  . Then 
instead of  ( 4. 12 ) we  get 
 
 F=P                             ( 4. 13 )  
 
If the directions of velocity and the force coincide, the power 
is equal to the force multiplied by the velocity of the point of 
application of the force. A useful power output due to  force of 
gravity is given by  
 
                             (4.14 ) 
If the  power input of a engine is N then its mechanical 
efficiency is calculated by

 86 
             
Solution:  A formula (4.15) is used; 
 
      
Solving  for  N gives 
      
Answer:  
 
 In particular, for the power, developed by the engine of 
machine we get  
 
M   2=P                          ( 4. 16 )  
 
where  is the frequency, M=Fr   the torque, and r is the radius 
of pulley. 
Power is measured in watts ( W ). A watt is one joule per 
second: 1 W = 1 J / 1 sec.  
 
Example 4.3: A  48 kg mass is lifted by the moveable pulley. 
What is the mechanical efficiency of pulley if the  a force of

4.3.  Potential  and   kinetic energies 
 
 Energy is a physical quantity characterizing the  property  of 
an object  to do work. When an  object changes its state the energy 
changes as well. 
Energy is measured in the units of work, viz. in joules. In 
mechanics are considered two type of energy: potential and 
kinetic energies. 
Potential energy is associated with location, or position, 
because a force is required and work is done in moving an object 
from one position to another. A body lifted above the Earths 
surface has a potential energy, equal to the product of the force of 
gravity and the height to which it has been lifted. For the height 
very smaller as compared to  the Earths radius the  potential 
energy is expressed as  
E P = mgh                             ( 4. 18 ) 
 
When the height h can be compared with the Earth s radius  
RE the acceleration due to gravity g depends on the distance. Then 
dependence of mg upon the h will have the form as illustrated in 
Fig.4.4 When g is constant the EP  is equal in magnitude to the 
area of polygon  shown in Fig.4.5. 
 88 
 Potential energy of elastic spring is determined by the 
formula 
                         ( 4. 19 ) 
 
where x  is the change of length of the specimen and k is the 
coefficient of elasticity ( or it is called spring constant ) 
Kinetic energy.   Any moving body has a certain  property  to 
do work, i.e. a certain energy due to its motion, which is called a 
kinetic energy. Consider as an example  an object of mass m 
resting on a frictionless surface. A constant force F acts on it 
through a displacement   s  . The force will accelerate the object in 
accordance with Newton’s second law  F=ma. If we multiply both 
sides of this equation by displacement  s  , the left  hand side of 
this  equation represents work  done  on an object. 
 
F s = mas                                ( 4. 20 ) 
 
The speed of an object starting from rest is  2 =2as   This 
expression can be rearranged to read  as  as = 2 /2 . Substituting 
into the equation Fs = mas,  gives 
F s = 
m  
2
2
                           ( 4. 21 ) 
The expression  ( 4.17 ) relates the work done on the mass to 
its resulting speed. The right hand side of the equation states that 
amount of work  done on  mass m  moving with velocity   can do 
as it is brought to rest. The energy  the object has because of its 
velocity equals the work that was done to give the mass its 
velocity. Thus, the quantity     is called the kinetic energy  
 of  an   object.

expressions 
                       (4.23) 
where  p-is the linear momentum. 
 
If the object starts moving with a certain initial velocity then 
the work  done  is defined by the difference  in  kinetic energies 
 
W=                         ( 4. 24 ) 
 
 
4.4. Law of conservation  of mechanical energy 
 
The total mechanical energy of the body is the sum of its 
kinetic and potential energies. 
 
                    (4.25) 
 
 The law of conservation of energy states that the total energy 
of a system cannot change, unless work is done on the system. 
Within an isolated system energy can change from one form to 
another, but the total amount of energy always remains the same. 
Energy can never be lost by a system. Let us consider the free 
falling motion of a body. In Fig.4.8 are given time dependencies 
of  kinetic an potential energies. The dependencies of these  
energies versus the height ar shown in Fig.4.9.  It is seen that in 
both cases a decreasing in potential energy causes an equal 
increase in kinetic energy. 
If an object  moves from one position to another the law of 
conservation of mechanical energy is written as

At the highest point ; therefore   
Hence, one may conclude that

Solution: We use Eq. (4.26) and since body’s second position is 
the Earth’s surface then . Second term in the right-hand

by 
 
Answer:  
     For an object of mass  m    suspended from the spring with 
constant  k   total mechanical energy is the sum of kinetic energy 
of an object and potential energy of spring.

is the sum of instantaneous values  of  kinetic and potential 
energies:

 Mechanical  oscillations 
 
 
§5.1. Principal   definitions 
 
Motion of bodies repeated exactly or approximately through 
equal time interval is called the mechanical oscillation. As an 
examples of mechanical oscillations the motion of  mathematical 
pendulum or a motion of the bob suspended from a spring may be 
considered. Oscillation process is characterized by  its  frequency 
 ( f ) and period (T). 
Period is called the minimum time interval through  which the 
motion of body is repeated. Period is measured in seconds. 
Frequency is the number of oscillations per unit time and is 
inversly proportional to the period.

§5.2. Harmonic oscillations 
 
The analytical description of oscillations is given by the 
dependence of displacement ( x ) as a function of time  x =f( t )  
(Fig.5.1) 
    The oscillations which are described by means of equation 
 
x= xm sin(  t+ 0 )              ( 5. 3 ) 
 
are called the harmonic oscillation. In 
(1.3) the x m  is  the maximum 
displacement from the position of 
equilibrium which  is called the 
amplitude. A quantity  (  t + 0  ) is 
called the phase, 0   the phase at the 
initial moment of time (t=0)  known as  
phase constant . 
Velocity of a body in harmonic 
oscillations is determined as

§5.3. Free oscillations  of a spring pendulum 
 
The oscillations appeared due to  internal forces are called free 
oscillations. For example, the motion of a  body is performed only  
under action of the force of elasticity is considered to be the free 
oscillation. Let consider the motion of the bob suspended from the 
spring ( Fig .5.2a ) An equation of its motion can be written as  
                            
ma = kx   ,    ( 5. 6 ) 
 
where k  is the 
coefficient of 
elasticity of spring, m 
 is the mass of the 
bob.  Frequency and 
period  of such 
motion are                                           Fig.5.2

If the mass of spring  m s   is small as compared to the  mass  m, 
but cannot be neglected then the equivalent mass of such 
oscillating system is equal to   m + ( 1/3) m s  and for period we 
get

§5.4. Mathematical   pendulum 
 
The body of small sizes suspended from  non-stretched thread 
which mass is smaller as compared to mass of the body is called  
the mathematical pendulum.  The oscillation becomes harmonic 
when the deflections from the position of equilibrium are small 
and the resultant of gravitational and elasticity forces directed 
towards the  equilibrium position appears. ( Fig.5.2b ). The period 
s dependence on the free falling acceleration has the form

§5.5.  Physical  and torsion pendulums 
 
 A real body doing an oscillations under action of its weight is 
called the physical pendulum. Such a body is shown in Fig..5.3a 
from which  can be seen that force of gravity acts to the center of 
gravity, located at a distnace b from point of support. The torque 
acting on the physical pendulum about the  point O is given by 
                                           
 = mgbsin    .                        ( 5. 16 )                                    
 
On the other, according to the Newton s second law for 
rotational motion the 
torkue is 
 
    = I    ,         (5.17 ) 
 
where I is the moment 
of inertia and  is the 
angular  acceleration.                             Fig.5.3 
Solving (5.16) and (5.17) for the period of physical pendulum 
we obtain

The point located at the distance  L = I / (mb)  from  point of 
support on the line, passing through the center of gravity  is called 
the rocking center. The rocking centre of specimen of length l is 
placed at  a distance L = l )3/2(   from the rotational axis.  
A comparison of formulas (5.11) and (5.18) shows that a period 
of mathematical pendulum of length L=I / mb is the same as a 
period of physical pendulum.. 
A torsional pendulum (Fig.5.3b) is a body which performs 
rotary- oscillatory motion under the action of a spring. Under a 
certain condition such motion can also be considered harmonic. 
The period of a torsional pendulum is given by the formula: 
 
T
I
K
 2                                  ( 5.19 ) 
 
where I  is the moment of inertia of the body about the axis of 
rotation, and K is the torsional rigidity, equal numerically to the 
torkue required to turn the body through unit angle. 
 
 
§5.6.  Energy conversions  in  oscillations 
 
When a pendulum performes oscillations a mutual conversion 
of kinetic and potential energies takes place. Consider the 
mathematical pendulum. When the motion is directed toward the 
position of equilibrium its velocity rises, i.e. the kinetic energy 
increases. Increment of kinetic energy is due to decreasing of 
potential energy as a result of reducing of the distance from the 
Earth’s surface. When motion of a spring pendulum is directed 
upward or updown from equilibrium position its potential energy 
increases. Energies of both pendulums reach maximum value at 
the equilibrium position. Kinetic and potential energies are  given 
by

§5.7. Addition of coinciding  and    perpendicular 
oscillations 
 
Suppose, displacements of two coinciding harmonic 
oscillations are given as  
x1 = xm 1 cos (  t+ 01 )  ,                     (5.22) 
 
x2 = xm 2 cos (  t + 02  )    .                  (5.23) 
 
The displacement  of resultant harmonic motion is  
 
x= xm cos (  t  +   )                          (5.24) 
 
 88 
where xm  refers to the amplitude of resultant oscillation,  -is 
the phase. The quantitues  xm  and    are given by the following 
formulas:

Two perpendicular oscillations  can be described by  
 
x= x mx (  x +  0 x ) ;     y = x my (  y  +  0y  )    . 
 
Consider the cases: 
  x =  y  =  .

slope is equal to  x my  / x mx

In this case the patticle s motion is occur also over the ellipse, but 
amplitudes may be  either equal or  unequal.  
  
§5.8. Damped  oscillations 
 
The really mechanical oscillations do not occur without energy 
loss. A certain part of mechanical energy is converted into the 
 89 
internal energy of atom s or molecules heat movement. 
Amplitude of oscillations decreases stage by stage and through  
any time interval is stopped. 
Free mechanical oscillations are  always damping. Equation of 
damped oscillations is expressed by 
 
ma =  kx + Ffric.     ,                        (5.27) 
 
where Ffric. is the  frictional force depending on the velocity as 
Ffric.=  r . Solution  of (5.27 ) gives 
 
x = xmcos(t+ )                          (5.28) 
 
where xm= xm0 e

The damping process is characterized by the logarithmic 
decrement of damping. This quantity is determined by the ratio of 
two seriesly amplitudes of oscillations, splitted with the time 
interval equal to the oscillation s period T and is

equation 
 = T    .                             (5.31) 
 
 
§5.9.  Forced oscillations 
 
The oscillations of a body under the action of periodic driving 
force are called the forced oscillations. 
An equation of forced oscillations has the form. 
 
ma=kx + Ffric. + F forced.   .             (5.32) 
 
The solution of ( 5.32  ) has the form  
 
x= mx  cos ( t +  0 )  ,                      (5.33)

 When the frequency of external driving force approaches the 
frequency of natural oscillations of the body, the  amplitude of the 
forced oscillations increases sharply. This phenomenon is called 
resonance.  
 Cyclic frequency  of forced oscillatios  upon resonance equals 
to 
 res =     0

CHAPTER  6 
    
Mechanical waves 
 
 
§6.1. Velocity   and  wavelength  of wave 
  
 A process of propagation of oscillation in space is called the 
wave. Mechanical waves propagate in elastic medium. In such 
medium there are forces of interaction, opposited any deformation 
among of particles. For example. pressure of gas to the valls of 
vessel provide up to resist the changing of volume. Mechanical 
waves are transversed and longitudinal. Waves which vibrations 
are occur perpendicular to the direction of propagation are called 
transversed waves. Transversed waves propagate in solids under 
action either of force of elasticity ( shear deformation ) or of 
forces of gravity and surface tension. Waves which wibrations are 
occur in the direction of propagation are called longitudinal 
waves.  Longitudinal waves can arrise in gases, liquids and also in 
solids. Harmonic oscillations of... in  the gas or liquid filled tube 
are transmitted by means of particles of matter due to force of 
elasticity, thus the longitudinal elastic wave propagates along the 
tube. It presents itself the system of compressions  and 
rarefactions changing periodically their positions. 
The propagation process  both  transversed and longitudinal 
waves is not accompanied by  the transfer of substance in 
direction of wave propagation. The mediums particles performe 
 93 
the oscillations relative the position of equilibrium in each point. 
However the propagation of waves is accompanied by energy 
transfer from one point of medium to another. 
A quantity numerically equal to the distance which any point of 
wave surface passes per unit time. is called velocity of wave 
propagation 
 =

Vector  of velocity is directed along the perpendicular to the 
wave surface. 
Wavelength. From the definition of velocity is resulted that 
wave length is the distance passed by the wave surface during time 
interval equal the period T 
 
=  T   .                                    (6.1) 
 
Since T=1/ f , then the ( 5.33 ) takes the form 
 
  =  f   .                                   (6.2) 
 
There is another definition of wave length: The distance 
between nearest one to another points oscillating with the identic 
phases is called wavelength. Phase changing   during period T 
is equal to 2 . Hence,

where A -  refers to the area of surface perpendicular  to the 
direction of propagation of wave. 
 
 
§6.3. Standing  or  stationary waves 
 
Consider a rubber cord which is clumped by one end. If wiggle 
its other end by holding it in hand we observe that the wave that 
was set up along the cord subsides after stopping  the motion of 
the hand.By  continuing the process  a different wiggling 
frequency waves will be arrise in both directions so the incident 
wave will  interferre with reflecting one. As a rule a perfect 
irregularity is appeared. But if the cord will be wiggled at a 
particular frequency f.. the cord even after the motion of the hand 
has been stopped, continues to oscillate as shown in Fig... a. In the 
present case we do not see any wave moving along the cord, but 
instead, the whole of it continues to oscillate in the loop, with its 
two ends being at rest and the central portion vibrating with 
maximum amplitude. A wave has been set up on the cord that 
keeps it oscillating in this fashion. These waves are known as 
stationary or standing waves because no wave moving on the cord 
is visible. Similarly as the wiggling frequency is further increased, 
stationary waves are set up at frequencies 2f1, 3 f1, .., etc.. then the 
cord oscillates in two and three loops correspondingly.The points 
N1 , N2 , N3 , always remain at rest and the points A1, A2, A3, 
oscillate with the maximum amplitude. Generally we can say that 
 96 
if the wiggling frequency is n1, stationary waves will be set up 
with the cord oscillating in  n  loops where n is an integer equal to 
1,2,3,...etc. The points on the cord which do not oscillate at all are 
known as nodes and the points which oscillate with the maximum 
amplitude are known as antinodes. 
Now consider a string of length L which is kept stretched by 
clamping its two ends so that the tension in the string is T. If the 
string is plucked at its middle point, two transverse waves will 
originate from the point.. One of them will move towards the left 
end of the string and the other towards its right end. When these 
wave reach the two clamped ends, they are reflected back thus 
giving rise to stationary waves. The string will vibrate with such a 
frequency so that nodes are formed at the new clamped ends and 
the middle point of the string becomes an antinode. Thus the 
string vibrates in one loop as shown in Fig.6.1a  It should be noted 
that the string was plucked from the position of the antinode. As 
the distance between two consecutive nodes is half the wavelength 
and 1.. is wavelength in this mode of vibration so 
 
1 = 2 l  .                                   ( 6.10 ) 
 
       
Fig.6.1 
 
If v is speed of either of the component waves, then from the 
equation 
 = f11      or     f1 =  / 2 l  .                   ( 6.11 ) 
 
If m is the total mass of the string, it can be shown that the 
velocity v of the wave along the string is given by 
 97 
 
 = 
m
l T 
,                               ( 6.12 ) 
 
where T is the tension in the string. Substituting the value of v in 
equation  (6.11)  we get 
f1 = 
1
2 l m
l T 
    .                         ( 6.13 ) 
  
If the same string is plucked from one quarter of its length then 
again stationary waves will be set up but now the string will 
vibrate with another frequency 2 and the position of nodes and 
antinodes are as shown in Fig.6.1b. Wavelength in this mode of 
vibration is  
   
 2 = l          .                             ( 6.14 ) 
 
A comparison of this equation with the equation... shows that 
the wavelength in this case becomes half that in the first case. 
Now from  the equation   = f  it follows 
 
  = f2 l      or     f2 =  / l                      ( 6.15 ) 
 
Comparing  with equation ( 2.11 )  gives  
 
f2 = 2f1                                   ( 6. 16 ) 
 
Thus when the string vibrates in two loops, its frequency is 
double than when it vibrates in one loop. Thus we can generalise 
that if the string is made to vibrate in  n loops, then the frequency 
at which the stationary waves will be set up on the string will be  
fn = n f1,   and the wavelength    = ln  )/2(   . 
 98 
Stationary waves can be set up on the string only with a 
discrete set of frequencies f1, 2f1, 3f1 etc. The lowest of these is 
known as fundamental and the others which are the integral 
multiples of the fundamental are known as overtones or 
harmonics. 
Similar situation is occur in a column of air. Two sort of air 
column can be distinguished. The former is which both ends are 
open. Open tube has the antinodes at both ends. The air particles 
vibrate likely longitudinal or compressional waves in a tube. Note, 
that in order to producing the standing waves one node  must 
arrised be at least in a tube. Since a distance between consecutive 
nodes or antinodes is always equal to half the wavelength  /2  
then the half of wavelength can place  in tube: L=/2 and the 
fundamental frequency f1 =   / = /2L, where   is the sound 
velocity in air. The standing wave, having two nodes is the first 
overtones or the second harmonics of vibrations. 
If the tube is closed at one side, the antinode produces at the 
open end, while the node at the closed end. Since a distance 
between the node and nearest antinode is equal to  /4, the quarter 
the wavelength with fundamental ffrequency will be placed in the 
tube: L=/4. Thus, the fundamental frequency equals to f1=/4L. 
  
 
§6.4.  Sound waves 
   
The mechanical vibrations of elastic media with frequencies 
ranging from 16 Hz to 20.000 kHz  produce the sensation in the 
human ear. These wibrations are called the sound waves. Sound 
waves with frequencies low 16 Hz are called infrasonic, but waves 
with frequencies above 20.000 Hz are called ultrasonic.  In gases 
sound waves travel in the form of compressions and rarefactions. 
In  the equation ( 6.4 ) the elasticity E is thus the bulk modulus 
which is given by the ratio of stress to volumetric strain  A stress   
 99 
here   means the  change in  pressure.Thus,  if  take into account 
that E= p,   we get

Velocity of sound in gas is approxomately equal to the velocity 
of heat movement of molecules. At standart conditions (T=273 K) 
for gas   =1,4 and  v=20 T =330 m/ s. 
Sound waves are characterized by loudness and pitch. 
The  loudness depends on the intensity and is determined by the 
amplitude of oscillations in the sound wave. Human ear has ability 
to receive the sound with intensities ranging from 10 12  to 10 11 
Wt/ m2 
The pitch depends  on the frequency. The greatest sensation of 
human ear is to the frequencies from 7x10 2 to 6x10 3 Hz. 
A measure of sensation of human ear to sound wave at given 
intensity is the intensity level L, defined as

Mechanics of liquids 
 
 
§7.1. The  hydrostatic  pressure 
 
 When a force F acts perpendicular to a surface  of area  A, the 
pressure acting on the surface is the ratio between the force and 
the area: 
P =
A
F
   .                                 ( 7. 1 ) 
Pressure is measured using a monometer or other type of 
gauge. A barometer is used to measure atmospheric pressure. 
Standard atmospheric pressure is 1.013x105 N/m2. 
SI unit of pressure is the pascal  Pa: 1 Pa = 1 N / 1 m2 
  A liquid, as distinct from solids, accepts the shape of vessel in 
which is contained.  Therefore the surface of the liquid always is 
perpendicular to the force acting on it. Pressure of a column of 
liquid is due to the weight of the column and is calculated by the 
formula: 
p =   g h  ,                           ( 7. 2 ) 
 
where    is the density of  liquid and  h - the height of the 
column. 
Pressure determined  by (7.2) is called the hydrostatic 
pressure. 
 102 
§7.2.  Pascal’s principle. Law of communicating 
vessels 
 
Pascal’s principle states that  an external pressure applied to a 
confined fluid is transmitted throughout the fluid.. For instance, 
pressures acting on all pistons in hydraulic machine are equal. 
However, as a result of variety of pistons “ areas, forces acting  
those are not equal. Since  p1= p2  and then

Law of communicating vessels states that 
in the gravitational field heights of  liquids

§7.3. Archimedes‘  principle. Float conditions 
 
 A body  submerged  wholly or partially in a fluid is exerted by a 
buoyant   force, equal in magnitude to the  weight of fluid 
displaced by it. This force is known as a Archimedes ‘ force. and 
 103 
is exerted to the pressure center of immersed part of the body or to 
the mass center of the body, if it is  perfectly immersed . .  
Archimedes‘  force is given by

Float conditions.  In dependence of the buoyant force a body 
may be in one of three situations. 
a )  mg   FA . An object will float in a fluid if the density of the 
object is less than the density of the fluid. 
b ) mg = FA.  An object will be in equilibrium at any submerged 
depth in a fluid if the densities of the object and the fluid are 
equal. 
g )   mg   FA  An object will sink in an fluid if the density of 
the object is greater than the  density of the fluid.  
 
 
§7.4. Motion of ideal fluid. Equation  of continuity 
 
Motion of a fluid  occurs under acting of force of gravity and 
difference in pressures. Velocity of each particle in flux of a fluid has a 
certain magnitude and direction for any moment of time. A space 
occupied by fluids‘ particles is called flux. In order to determine the 
direction of velocities the current lines are used. Tangents of these at 
arbitrary points give the direction of flowing. A fluid is called an ideal 
if the internal frictional forces can be neglected. On the contrary, when 
one layer of a fluid moves over another layer forces of  friction arise. 
Such fluids are known as a viscous fluid. A flowing of fluid is called 
laminar if the velocity and pressure at each point are independent on 
time. A flowing is described graphically be current lines. 
A surface formed by current lines passing through contour in a fluid 
is called current pipe. When a flow is steady, a mass of fluid passing 
through any cross-sectional area per unit time remains constant 
 (Fig.7.2a) Fluid can not be stored in various sections of the pipe. It 
permits to write the equation as   
 
 104 
m=const.      l A=const.      or     A=const. 
 
In particular

Expression  ( 7. 7 ) is  known  as  the  equation  of continuity.

§7.5.  Bernoullis  equation 
 
 Consider a steady flow of incompressible fluid. Let us calculate the 
work needed to displace a certain volume of a fluid from one section  to 
another ( Fig.7.2b ). A displacement of fluid through cross sectional 
area A1 by a distance  causes to remove it through the cross section A2. 
by distance  . A fluid in left side of A1 produces a pressure P on the 
considered volume and performers a certain work W1 =P1 A1 l1.  In 
cross- section A2  the work performed is equal to W2 = P2 A2 l 2 (here 
the work done is opposed to the direction of flow). The work done  in 
the field of gravity is written as W=  mg ( h 2   h 1 ). The total work 
done   onto  the fluid is equal to the change in kinetic energy. Thus

  2   +   gh = const.                ( 7. 10 ) 
 
Thus  the sum  of static, dynamic and hydrostatic pressures 
remains the unchaingeable. Static pressure is due to fluids forces 
of elasticity.  Dynamic pressure is  due to kinetic energy of 
moving fluid. 
If the pipe is placed horizontally the equation ( 7.10 ) can be 
rewritten as .

  2  = const.                       ( 7. 11 )   
  
With increase   in   flux velocity the dynamic component of 
pressure increases while the static component decreases. The 
dynamic pressure of a fluid at rest is equal to zero. Then the total 
pressure is composed of static and hydrostatic pressures i.e., the 
pressures produced by piston and weight of  fluid’s column 
respectively. 
A work done  during  time t by a pump with power N when it 
remove the fluid of volume V up to the height  h  is given as 
 
N t = V g h                             ( 7. 12 ) 
 
where  - is the coefficient of useful work (efficiency)  of a pump 
.

§7.6. Flux pressure measurement 
 
 Static pressure is measured by means of monometer whose 
cross-sectional plane is placed parallel to the direction of flow.  
Total pressure is measured by means of monometer whose 
cross-sectional plane is placed perpendicular to the direction of 
flow (Pito’s pipe)The difference of total and pressures is measured 
by the Prandtles pipe The difference of two static pressures is 
measured by the Venturys pipe By knowing difference of the 
static pressures the velocity can be calculated as

§7.8. Internal resistance of fluid 
 
The resistance of a fluid includes two types; resistance due to 
pressure and resistance related to the friction. The first component 
is determined by the difference of pressures at the end ( edges ) of 
the body. The second one appears due to great gradient of 
velocity:

velocity,  x  the distance between layers , and A  is the area of  
fluid’s surfaces in contact. Eq. ( 7.17  ) is known as Newton s 
formula. 
The SI unit of measurement of     is Pa  sec. Another unit of

The   resistance due to difference in  pressures depends on the 
density of fluid, its velocity and maximum cross  sectional area,

CHAPTER 8  
  
 Molecular Physics and Heat 
 
 
§ 8.1. Movement  of  molecules 
 
A particle of  substance with minimum sizes storing its 
chemical properties is called molecule.  
Molecules of all bodies are in uninterrupted movement and 
therefore  they possess  kinetic energy. 
In solids  molecules oscillate  relatively  a certain position in 
crystal lattice. 
In liquids  a molecules oscillate relatively time varying   instant 
position . 
In gases between molecules there is  a weak interaction  and 
therefore they move with higher speeds.  The given molecule 
moves rectilinearly  between   collisions with  other molecules  or  
molecules  of  obstacle . 
Movement of molecules in liquids and gases  is  observed  by 
means of  microscope. Small particles of the weighed substance 
under action of impacts of liquid s molecules move chaotically on 
a zigzag trajectory. Such movement refers to brownian movement. 
Size of molecules is considerable smaller. For example , a 
size of hydrogen molecule is about  ( 3 4 ) x10 10 m. 
 
 111 
§ 8.2. Measurement of molecules speed 
 
One of the first experiments in which speed of movement or 
separate molecules of gas was directly measured was executed by 
Otto Shtern.  In experiment the device  consisting of two cylinders 
with the common axis of rotation was used. On an axis of the 
cylinder the platinum wire covered with silver was located. When 
an electrical current passes through a wire as a result of its heating 
there occurs an evaporation of silver atoms from a surface of wire. 
Then on  the internal wall of the second cylinder forming on it  
appreciable strip. 
When cylinders were resulted in rotation with identical 
frequency a strip appeared in the other place. By  the angle  
between these two positions of a strip, distance  l=R2  R1 and 
frequency f  of rotation of cylinders it was possible to define speed 
of atoms of silver as  
 =


                              ( 8.1) 
 
 Strip of silver turned out at rotation of cylinders there was 
dim. It testifies to that that atoms of silver evaporated from the 
wires surface have different speeds. 
 
 
§ 8.3. Mean free path 
 
The average distance which the molecule travels between two  
successive collisions is called mean free path. Mean free path 
may be found as a ratio of a  distance  L passed (length of 
cylinder) to the number of collisions N over t time. (Fig.8.1)  On 
the other hand, a number of collisions is equal to the number of 
molecules,  whose centers placed within a cylinder or it is  the 
product of molecules’ concentration  n  by the volume V. Thus,

l = z/    ,                     
 
where z- is number of collisions per unit time,   
At a constant temperature the mean free path is inversely 
proportional to the pressure

§ 8.5.  Basic items of molecular  kinetic theory of gas. 
Pressure. Principal equation 
 
The basic items of m.k.t. of gas are: 
1.Gas molecules have small sizes compared with distance 
between them. 
2.Molecules move irregular and have different speed or 
direction. 
3.Collisions among molecules and walls of container are 
elastic.  
4.Gas molecules exert almost no forces on one another,  when 
they are not collide. 
The pressure of a gas on the walls 
of its container is the result of 
bombardments by billions of 
molecules. When a gas is compressed 
into a smaller volume, its molecules 
strike the walls at the container more 
often than before, leading to an 
increase in pressure. Pressure is 
determined by the expression:                                 Fig.8.2

where N/t the number of bombardments of  walls by molecules, S 
the area of wall,  Ft is the impulse of force. On the other hand the 
number of strikes N is equal to the number of molecules , which 
may be written as N= n0V= Autn0   Here u is the root mean square 
velocity. One can suppose , that  (1/3)N of molecules  move along 
the  considered axis . However, half , i.e. (1/2)(1/3)N of these 
molecules  move , for example, only in positive direction of axis. 
For simplicity, only horizontal molecular motion is shown in 
Fig.8.2   It is seen that the impulse of  force is equal to the change 
in momentum in the   direction of force   action. 
                                                 
F1x t = m x    m x   2m x  . 
 
At the moment of bombardment the molecule exerts on the 
wall the force F2  equal to the force F1 in magnitude and opposite 
in direction. With accounting mentioned assumptions above the  
pressure of a gas is determined by the so called principle  equation 
of kinetic theory: 
P =( 1/3)n0mu
2   ,                             ( 8. 8 ) 
 
where n0-is number of molecules per unit of volume, m-is the 
mass of molecule. 
 
§ 8.6. Partial pressure. Dalton s law.  Atmospheric 
pressure 
 
The pressure that  is exerted by an single gas occupying the 
total volume of mixture  is called the partial pressure of a gas.  
Daltons law: The pressure of the mixture of gases is equal to 
the sum of their partial pressures: 
 
                P = p1+ p2 + p3 +... + pn     .                       ( 8. 9 ) 
 
 115 
 The pressure of the atmosphere decreases with increasing 
distance (h) from the surface of the Earth. If it is assumed that the 
temperature of the atmosphere is independent of the height, then 
 
p= p0 
)/( RTghe      ,                            ( 8.10 )     
 
where  -  is the average molecular weight of the mixture of gases 
comprising the atmosphere. This expression is called Boltzman s 
law. 
To measure the air pressure both of mercury barometer and 
aneroid barometer are used. Upon the first way of measurements 
the height of a column of a mercury supported by the atmosphere 
is used. At the second way a measurement of pressure is related 
with the changes in the size of an evacuated chamber. The 
measured value of standard atmospheric pressure is equal to  
760 mm. Hg ( mercury column.) or 101325 kPa. 
 
§ 8.7. Amount of substance. Relative molecular mass. 
Mole. Avogadros law. Molar mass 
 
Amount of substance is called a physical quantity determined 
by the number of structural elements - molecules, atoms or ions. 
Note, the same amount of substances has different mass. 
Relative molecular mass: The SI unit of the amount of 
substance is taken a mole. The relative molar mass  is  the ratio  of 
the mass of molecule to the 1/12 portion of mass of carbon isotope 
12 C.  Mole is the amount of  substance containing the number of 
particles equal to the number of atoms in 0.012 kg of the carbon 
isotope 12 C. For relative mass of atom or  molecules  we get:

 116 
where m0 the mass of atom of substance, m0C is the mass of 
12C  
atom.  
Avogadros law: This law states, that an equal volumes of 
different gases contain the equal number of molecules at the same 
pressure and temperature. Moles of different substances also 
contain the equal number of molecules. It is called the Avogadros 
number: NA=6.02x1023 mol  
NA=

amount of substance . 
 Molar mass: The ratio of mass of substance to the amount of 
substance is called the molar mass. 
 
M=

     .                            ( 8.13 ) 
 
Fron ( 8.12 ) and ( 8.13 ) it follows:

found by means of formula: 
n=

NA .                            ( 8.15 ) 
From Avogadro’s law it follows, that under equal conditions 
the moles of different gases have equal volumes equal to  
V=22.4x10-3m3/mol. In particular for helium (He): 
Relative molecular mass Mr=44 
Molar mass M=0.044 kg/mol.

§ 8.8.  Diffusion. Fick’s equation 
 
 The process of mixing due to chaotic motion of molecules is 
known as a diffusion. In any case the diffused substance 
removes from the region with higher concentration into the 
region with lower value of concentration. This process results 
in equality both of temperature and concentration at all points 
of  substance. The flux of molecules experimentally was 
observed to be direct proportional the variation of 
concentration per unit of length or concentration gradient.

The expression ( 8. 16 ) is known as Fick s equation. The sign 
of minus in ( 8 .16 ) means that the flux is opposite to the 
concentration gradient . The diffusion coefficient D is 
expressed   by mean free path   l  of gas molecules by the  
simple relation:

§8.10. Temperature scales. Absolute zero. 
Thermometers 
 
Basically, temperature scales are 
classified into three major kinds: 
1. Celsius. 2. Kelvin.   3. Fahrenheit 
Both the Celsius and Kelvin scales split 
the region from freezing to boiling of water 
into 100 parts.  Each part called a degree. 
In the Celsius scale the freezing point of 
water is given the value 0C and the boiling 
point of water the value 100C. (Fig.8.6)                  Fig.8.6                                                
Absolute zero is that temperature at which the substance  
remains in gaseous state, exerts zero pressure (under constant 
volume ) or has zero volume under constant pressure). It is the 
lowest temperature in nature. In fact at temperature much above 
the absolute zero all gases undergo a change of gaseous state and 
become liquid. The absolute temperature scale has its zero point 
at 273C.  Temperatures in this scale are designated K 
Kelvin. Any Celsius temperature tc can be converted to its 
equivalent absolute temperature TK by adding 273. 
 
TK= tc+273  
 
The Fahrenheit scale divides  this region from freezing to 
boiling  in 180 parts. In this scale the freezing and boiling points 
of water are given the values 32F and 212F respectively. A 
degree is larger than a Fahrenheit degree by 9/5.  A simple 
equation  conversion between these  scales is  
 
TF=
9
5
tC+32      or    tC=
5
9
( TF  32 ) .     ( 8.22 ) 
 122 
To measure the temperature the following types of 
thermometers are used: 1 . Liquid thermometers, 2. Metal 
thermometers, 3. Resistivity  thermometers. 
The ordinary  liquid (mercury) thermometer uses the thermal 
expansion of mercury as a measure of temperature. Mercury is 
used as a thermometric substance because over a wide range of 
temperatures its expansion is quite a linear function of the 
temperature and that it does not stick to the walls of the capillary 
tube. 
 
§8.11.  Total energy. Transfer methods of  
internal energy 
 
Total energy consists of: 
a) kinetic energy of macroscopic motion. 
b) potential energy due to external field(for ex. electrical or 
gravitation field)   
c)internal energy. 
The internal energy consists  of: 
a) kinetic energy of   irregular motion of particle. 
b)potential energy due to the interaction between molecules . 
c) energy of electrons at the atomic or electron levels. 
d)internal energy of nucleus. 
The internal energy is accepted to be equal to zero at absolute 
zero (T= 0). 
The internal energy of one mole  of single atomic gas depends 
only on its temperature:  
U=
3
2
RT    .                                ( 8.23 ) 
 
Then a change of internal energy is expressed as 
U=
3
2
RT     where     T=T2-T1  . 
 123 
1. The  internal energy may be transferred by means of both 
forms:  work and heat. When the internal energy is transferred as a 
work the energy of regular motion of particles  is converted to the 
energy of irregular motion .The work of the system is considered 
to be “plus” when it is done on the external forces. When the ideal 
gas is expended the work done is “plus”. When the gas is 
compressed the work done is “minus”. 
2. Heat is the such form of energy transfer when the direct 
energy conversion among interacting particles or bodies  occurs. 
As a comparison  can be  said that, when the energy is 
transferred in the form of heat then it raises only the internal 
energy, but when the form of transfer is the work done, then the 
other types of energy may be increased as well. 
At the really conditions the both of forms of energy transfer 
are performed; when the metal specimen is heated its internal 
energy increases and the thermal expansion also takes place. 
Mechanical equivalent of heat  
 
I=4,19 J/cal   . 
 
The inverse quantity of I is equal to (1/I)=0,239 cal/J and is 
called the heat equivalent of work. 
 
 
§ 8.12. Work done due to variation  in volume 
 
The work performed at isobaric expansion of gas is 
expressed by the formula: 
 
W= p ( V 2    V 1 )  .                       ( 8.24 ) 
 
The area limited by the  graph and axis  V equals to the work 
performed. ( Fig. 8.7a  ) 
Work performed under due to isothermal change in 
volume: 
 124 
Expansion:  Direction of force (or pressure) coincides with 
the direction of displacement of a piston in a vessel. Therefore 
work done by gas is positive (W0 while work done by external 
forces is negative(W0) (Fig.8.7b) 
Compression. Direction of exterior  force coincides with the 
displacement of a piston, therefore work performed by external 
forces is positive (W 0), while work done by a gas is negative 
(W 0).(Fig.8.7c) 
 
 
 
Fig.8.7 
 
§8.13. First law of thermodynamics 
 
The first law of thermodynamics expresses the law of energy 
conservation. A  change  in  internal energy of gas ( U) is equal 
to the sum of amount of heat (Q) gained by the gas and work (W) 
performed on it. 
 
U = Q + W    .                        (8.25 ) 
 
Another form of this law  is: 
 
Q = U+W    here   W =  W. 
 
The amount of heat gained by the gas is expended to the 
increase of internal energy of gas and to the work  (W)done by 
the gas. 
 125 
The first law of thermodynamics can be written          
 for the various iso-processes as follows: 
1. Isothermal:   T=const.      U=0    Q=W 
2. Isobaric:    P=const. W=P V  
     Q= U+P V 
3. Isochoric:  V=const.     W=0        Q= U 
4. Adiabatic:      Q=0      U=W. (Fig.8.8) 
 
                                                     
The first law of thermodynamics permits to 
calculate amount of heat needed to increase the 
temperature of gas: 
1. Single-atomic gas:         Q=

2. Double-atomic gas:       Q=

3. Multi-atomic gas:           Q=4R .                     Fig.8.8 
 
 
§8.14. Heat capacity. Specific heat capacity. 
Molar heat capacity 
 
 The quantity of heat required to rise the temperature of a 
body for one degree is called the heat capacity 
 
C=Q/T   .                             ( 8.26 ) 
 
The quantity of heat required to rise the temperature of a body 
of unit mass for one degree is called the specific heat capacity  
 
c=Q/ mT    .                         ( 8.27 )    
 
The specific heat of a body depends on the mass, temperature, 
chemical composition and on the conditions under which it is 
 126 
heated mass, temperature, chemical composition and on the 
conditions under which it is heated.    
The values of specific heat capacity at constant pressure  cp 
and  at constant volume  cv, are related ( Mayers formula)  
 
Rcc VP   ,                             ( 8.28 ) 
 
 where R  is the  universal gas constant. 
To determine the specific heat capacity the equation of heat 
balance usually is used. Suppose that a body with mass m1 
specific heat capacity c1, has a temperature T1 , and it takes part in 
heat transfer  with the body of mass m2, s.h.c. c2, and temperature 
T2 . Then the amount of heat Q1 =m1c1(T1   T0)  lost by the hot 
body is equal to the  amount of heat Q2 =m 2 c 2(T0 T2).  gained 
by the cold  body Here T0  is the final temperature. On the basis of 
the energy conservation we have Q1=Q2  or 
 
m1c1( T1 T0)= m2 c2 ( T0  T2 ) . 
 
This expression is known as the law of  heat  exchange , in 
other words  heat lost = heat gained. 
Hence ( 4.6 ) it follows that,

CHAPTER 9 
    
Mutual conversion of liquids 
and gases 
 
 
§9.1. Evaporation. Latent heat of vaporization 
 
 The processes in which the molecules of a liquid escape into 
the air are  called  evaporation. The number  of molecules escaped  
from 1cm2  surface area of liquid per  second characterizes the  
speed of evaporation . Evaporation speed depends on the 
attractive forces between liquids molecules. When these forces 
are smaller the liquid evaporates more rapidly, for example, the 
alcohol evaporates more quickly than the water because the 
attraction of its particles is smaller than for  one another and 
greater number  of molecules can escape. Hence the average 
kinetic energy of the remaining molecules is lower and the liquid 
temperature drops. Evaporation speed depends also upon external 
conditions; such as it increases with increasing of   the open 
surface area of liquid and with decreasing of pressure over the 
liquid. Number of escaping molecules increases with the raising 
of temperature. 
Evaporation occurs only at a liquids surface and at all 
temperatures. 
 An evaporation of the liquid from the open vessel can proceed 
until all of the liquid is converted into vapor.  
 129 
 On the contrary, in the closed vessel evaporation proceeds 
until a state of equilibrium between the mass of the liquid and that 
of the vapor is reached. At this stage evaporation and 
condensation compensate each other. Such a state  is referred to  
dynamic  equilibrium. 
The process of evaporation causes the cooling. 
The amount of heat needed to convert 1 kg of a substance at 
the its boiling point from the liquid to the gaseous state is called 
latent heat of vaporization. ( Fig.9.1, d  e ) 
 
r  = Q/m    .                   ( 9 .1 ) 
 
The latent heat of vaporization is 
equal to the latent heat of 
condensation (converting from 
gaseous state to the liquid state) 
The SI unit of latent heat of 
vaporization is J / kg.                                                                    
                                                                    Fig.9.1 
 
 
§9.2. Saturated vapor. Vapor isotherms 
 
 A vapor  in dynamic equilibrium with its liquid is said to be 
saturated. For example, a vapor within the bubbles of gas is 
saturated. A pressure of saturated vapor is not dependent on its 
volume and is determined only by the absolute temperature. 
  
P=nkT   .                                  ( 9.2 )  
 
A pressure of saturated vapor rapidly is increased with 
increasing of temperature. In Fig.9.2a   the  P – T diagrams for 
saturated vapor   (1)  and ideal gas    (2)   are given.   Fig.9.2b   
shows the densities of liquid (curve 1)   and its saturated vapor 
(curve 2)   versus their temperature.  
 130 
The point  at which densities of liquid and its saturated vapor 
become equal is called the critical point. The value of 
temperature, corresponding to critical point is called critical 
temperature. 
When T = Tcrit. a difference between liquid and gas states of 
substance disappears. 
When T Tcrit. even  under greater pressures  a conversion of 
gas to liquid state is impossible.  
At T=Tcrit. the latent heat of vaporization  
and coefficient of surface tension is equal to 
zero.                 
A dependence of pressure on volume at a  
constant temperature is called the  isotherm 
of vapor. In Fig.9.3a  the part 0 1 
corresponds to ideal gas. The horizontal part 
of isotherm of vapor is due to the process of 
conversion of vapor into saturated vapor. 
The part 23 corresponds to liquid state. 
Under  decreasing of volume a pressure of a 
saturated vapor  remains unchangeable due 
to conversion its any part into liquid. The   
total volume of saturated vapor is perfect 
condensed at the point 2. Further decreasing            Fig.9.2 
 of  volume leads to the sharp increasing of pressure. It is 
explained with the small compressibility of liquid. 
The process of passing of ideal gas into saturated vapor may 
be performed not only by isothermal compressing, but also by 
decreasing of temperature. The isotherm 3210 may be 
considered as a curve  of liquid continuously passing  into 
saturated vapor. The process of conversion of saturated vapor into 
unsaturated can be occur not only by isothermal expansion, but 
also by increase  in temperature. unsaturated vapor , obtained by 
this way is called the superheated vapor. 
In the absence of condensation centers are absent by means of  
slow  isothermal condensation one can obtain the  supersaturated 
 131 
vapor, a pressure of which exceeds the pressure of saturated vapor  
at a given temperature. 
 
                                        Fig.9.3 
 
Isotherms plotted for  various high temperatures T1 , T2 , T3, 
(T3  T2 T1 ) show, that state of saturated vapor is realized at  
smaller values of  specific volume  v3 v2  v1 ( Fig.9.3b ). It is 
explained as follows: A pressure of saturated vapor raises rapidly 
with increasing of temperature and to compare it with the pressure 
of unsaturated vapor a decreasing of vapor s volume is need. Its 
reason is the heat expansion of liquids.  
 
§9.3. Boiling. Melting. Latent heat of fusion.  
Specific heat  of combustion 
 
The processes of evaporation in which the molecules is 
escaped at definite temperature  is called boiling. Boiling occurs 
in the entire volume of liquid. According to ( 9.2  ) a pressure of 
saturated vapor within of gas bubbles increases as the temperature 
raises. Consequently the volume of gas bubbles increases as well. 
It leads to increasing of Archimeds force acting to the bubbles 
and makes easy to raise upward. The external pressure is the sum 
of atmospheric p0 and hydrostatic  gh. More over the gas bubbles 
are compressed by the force of surface tension. If the depth is 
negligible then the total pressure may considered to be equal to 
the pressure over the liquid surface. A pressure of saturated vapor 
becomes greater than p0  at any temperature, which is called 
 132 
boiling temperature or boiling point. Boiling begins when the 
following condition  takes place:   
 
ps.v. =  nkT   p0 + gh     ,                ( 9.3 ) 
 
where  h-is the height of bubble of gas from the surface of liquid. 
Boiling temperature depends upon the  external factors; it is 
unchangeable  at a constant pressure, and  increases with   the  
raising  of   pressure   over the   liquid ( atmospheric pressure ).  It 
also is decreased with reducing of external pressure. For example, 
at the height about 3 km  where atmospheric pressure is about 500 
torr. a boiling point of water is 890 C. If the liquid is a mixture, 
then boiling point layers between the boiling points of 
components. 
The processes of converting of matter from solid to liquid at 
definite temperature is called melting.  Accordingly, this 
temperature is called melting point.  
The amount of heat needed to convert 1 kg of substance at its 
melting point from the solid to the liquid state.( Fig.9.1, b  c )  is 
called the latent heat of fusion. 
 
=Q/m                                 ( 9.4 ) 
 
The latent heat of fusion is equal to the latent heat of 
crystallisation (converting from liquid state to the solid state) 
The SI unit of latent heat of fusion is J/kg. 
Specific heat of  combustion is defined with the amount of heat   
which is dedicated when 1 kg of fuel is burning: 
 
k=Q/mfuel.                            ( 9.5 )

§9.4. Examples  of heat exchange equations 
 
The heat exchange  equations ( Look the equation 8.28  ) for 
some cases are given here-below: 
1.  The fuel burns and any (  ) fraction of gained heat is 
expended to heating of vessel and the liquid within  it: 
               
  
2.   The hot and cold liquids are mixed: 
 
chotmhot( thot  ) =ccoldm cold( tcold)               ( 9.7 ) 
 
3.   The hot body is placed in the cold liquid: 
 
chotmhot( thot  ) =ccoldmcold(   tcold) +  
       + cv es. mv es. (   t v es.)                                       ( 9.8 ) 
 
If the cold body is placed in the hot liquid an equation  will  
obtain the form: 
 
c bodym body (  tbody)=cliqmliq.( tliq  ) +  
+  c vm v( tv  )    .                                          ( 9.10 ) 
 
4.  The hot body is placed within the liquid and  some  part 
of liquid is vaporized: 
 
chotmhot( thot ) =cliq.mliq.(  tliq. ) +  
+ c v m v ( t v ) +  rm vap.  .                         ( 9.11 ) 
 
5.  The vapor passes through the liquid:

+ c v  m v( t v.)   .                       ( 9.12 )

In these expressions   the  common temperature, r the, 
latent heat of vaporization,  is the latent heat of fusion. 
 
§9.5. Humidity. Dew point 
 
Humidity.  In the atmospheric air always exists certain 
quantity of water vapor. The partial pressure of water vapor can 
not be exceed the certain value depending on temperature and 
pressure of  saturated water vapor. In the given volume at a certain 
temperature may exists only definite greatest quantity of water 
vapor. 
The  greatest amount of water vapor which can be existed in 1 
m3 of air at each temperature is called maximum humidity or 
amount of saturated vapor. 
fmax.=m/V    ,                          ( 9.17 ) 
 
 135 
where m the possible maximum mass of water vapor in  the air , V  
is the volume of air. 
Usually, amount of vapor in the air is less than the possible 
maximum value. 
Amount of vapor, existing in 1 m3 of air in fact is called 
absolute humidity. 
The ratio of absolute to the possible maximum humidity is 
called the relative humidity of air. 
 
  f / fmax.   .                       ( 9.18 ) 
 
Since fmax. depends upon temperature the relative humidity 
changes with temperature even though when the absolute 
humidity remains constant. If the relative humidity is known for 
temperature T1 we can find its value for temperature T2.

Dew point.  A condensation  of vapor existing in the air 
begins under cooling until definite temperature. This  temperature 
is called the dew point. 
The relatively humidity reaches 100 under cooling until 
dew point. 
At the temperature is below than the dew point, any part of 
water vapor  is subjected to condensation. If the relative humidity 
 1  is known for temperature T1, then we can find a mass of dew 
for any temperature below the dew point. 
 
                 m=V( fmax.( Tdew.)  fmax.(T2))      or

Measurement of humidity.  For measurement of air relative 
humidity the  hair hygrometers are used. In them  the skim hairs 
which length varies with the change of humidity are applied. 
Other device for measurement of humidity of air is psychrometer, 
consisting of two identical thermometers. In one of them a glass 
ball with mercury is wrapped up by a wet cloth. Water 
evaporating cools this thermometer and it shows lower 
temperature than dry. Difference of temperatures serves as a 
measure of relative humidity. If   = 100,  then T=0 .  
 
 
§9.6. Convection , conduction and  
thermal radiation 
 
A heat is transferred by means of convection,  conduction and 
thermal radiation processes.  
Convection. The density of a warmer fluids and gas is less 
than colder ones. Therefore they always try to rise upward.  
Then moving stream of fluid or gas transfers with its  heat. It is 
called a convection. 
 Conduction. The molecules of that parts of the body, which 
has a higher temperature have a greater energy and transfers it to 
surrounded molecules with lower energy. It leads to equality of 
temperature within of body. In contrary to the convection the 
conduction is not related with transfer of particles. The amount of 
heat transferred through a layer of substance of thickness l and 
cross-sectional area A which has a temperature difference  T on 
its planes in a time t is given by   
 
Q = 
l
T 
At     .                         ( 9. 21 ) 
 
where -is the thermal conductivity. It is measured in Wt/mK. 
The ratio Q/ t  is called a heat flux.   
Heat transport.  When substances  are in contact with solids  
 137 
they will give or gain a heat quantity 
 
T A t  =Q      ,                          ( 9. 22 )   
 
where   coefficient of heat transport. 
Equivalent coefficient of heat transferring  k  is related with 
the coefficients    and   by  expression:

  
  
                          ( 9. 23 ) 
 
In these processes  the sum of separate temperature differences is 
equal to the total temperature  difference. 
 Thermal radiation. The energy, emitted by heated body per 
unit of time is proportional to the fourth power of the absolute 
temperature T. A quantity of emitted energy is proportional as 
well as to the area of radiating  solids surface, so that energy 
emitted per unit  time is given by 
 
 t

where - is the  coefficient of proportionality, called the Stefan-
Boltzmans  constant. The number e value of which has diapason 
0  e  1 is called the irradiating ability. For black bodies value of  
e  is near to unit. 
Any body not only emits energy but  
also absorbs the energy radiated by other bodies. Therefore, 
resultant heat flux irradiated by body is written as.

where T1 the temperature of the body, T2  the temperature of 
surrounding medium. As can be seen from (9.25) the heat transfer 
 138 
in any direction disappears only in case, when temperatures of 
both of bodies and medium are the same. 
 
 
§9.7.  Cyclic  processes. Carnot cycle 
     
 Set of processes as a result of which  the 
system comes back in an initial condition 
refers to as circular processes. In a basis                     
of work of all cyclic thermal machines lay 
circular processes. On the P V diagram 
circular process is represented the closed 
curve. (Fig 9.4a,b,c ) Points 1 and 2 
incorporate two various curves. Work made 
by system at transitions from one state to 
another is computed  by the area under 
corresponding curve. Carnot   has found  
that in order to achieve   the most full 
transformation of thermal energy into 
mechanical a cycle consisting of four 
consecutive thermodynamic process should 
be done by gas: (Fig. 9.4d)

In these formulas   is determined as   = C P / C V ,   where C P 
and C V  are molar capacities under constant pressure and volume 
respectively. 
 
 
§ 9.8.  Heat engines. The thermal efficiency 
 
A device that turns heat into mechanical energy or work is 
called a heat engine. A heat engine converts part of the heat 
flowing from a hot reservoir  Q1 to a cold one  Q2 into work 
W.(Fig.9.5). 
 Thus  
W= Q1    Q2 . 
 
 The thermal efficiency  of a  cyclic heat engine is defined to 
be the ratio of the net work  W done by the engine in each cycle to 
the heat Q1  absorbed in each cycle, or 
 
 140 
=

where  Q2  is  the heat rejected in each cycle. From  ( 9. 30 )  it is 
obvious that a heat engine will have 100 percent efficiency if Q2 
=0, that is if no heat were exhausted by the engine so that all the 
heat absorbed were converted to work. 
Maximum efficiency of an idealized without friction and 
other sources of energy loss heat engine depends only on the 
absolute temperatures Thot. and Tcold. of the hot operates:  
 
Eeff.max.=(1-Tcold./Thot.)100    .                ( 9. 31 )   
    
The value of 
Eeff.max. is usually 
more than 50 
percent, however 
the actual efficiency 
is less than 40 
percent in mostly 
cases. 
The efficiency 
of internal combustion                       Fig.9.5 
 engines is expressed by  
the formula:

§ 9.9. Refrigerator. Coefficient of performance 
 
  A heat engine operating in reverse transfers heat from a cold 
reservoir to a hot reservoir with the help of external work. This 
external work is also converted into heat and is given over to the 
 141 
hot reservoir. A heat engine operating in reverse is called a 
refrigerator or a heat pump. In a refrigerator  the interest lies in 
the amount of heat that is removed from a cold reservoir, while in 
a heat pump the interest is the amount of heat rejected to the hot 
reservoir. Both these devices cause heat to flow from a low 
temperature reservoir to a HTR at the cost of the external 
mechanical work that must be supplied to the system.  The  
quantity  Q2  + W  is the amount of heat Q1 which is rejected to 
the hot reservoir. From the first law of thermodynamics  
 
Q1 = Q2  + W  . 
 
 For refrigerator the coefficient of performance  E is defined as

§ 9.10.  Thermal expansion 
  
1) Thermal expansion of solids is characterized by the 
following  quantities:  
   coefficient of linear thermal expansion,    coefficient of 
surface expansion, and    coefficient of volume expansion . 
a) Linear  expansion is calculated by the formula 
 
L2=L1 (1 +  t )       hence     

 142 
where L1  the initial length at temperature t1 ,  L2  the finally 
lentgh at temperature t2 ,  and   t =t2    t1. 
2) Surface expansion:  This type of expansion can be 
considered as a linear expansion in two dimensions: 
 
S2=S 1(1 +  t )    ,                        (9. 35 ) 
where   = 2 
3)  Volume expansion:  Volume expansion is considered as a 
linear expansion in three dimensions: 
 
V2 = V1 ( 1 +  t )   ,                      ( 9. 36 ) 
where =3. 
 
Expansion of liquids. 
A liquid is extended in all dimensions. As a result of great 
mobility  of liquid s molecules it accepts the shape of vessel. 
Expansion of liquids is expressed by the formula: 
 
V2 = V1 ( 1 +  t )   .                    ( 9. 37 ) 
 
 Hence it follows that coefficient of volume extension  is 
equal to ratio of relatively extension  when temperature rises as 
1C. 
The density of liquids decreases with the rising of 
temperature, since a volume and a density are  inverse 
proportional:   1221 // VV

CHAPTER 10  
 
Properties of liquids 
 
 
 
§10.1. Surface energy and surface  tension 
 
Surface tension is due to force of attraction among the molecules. 
Force of attraction within of liquids are mutually compensated 
(molecule A , Fig.10.1). On the  molecules placed near the surface 
(one of those is molecule B) acts the resultant force directed from 
surface into the bulk of liquids. Therefore in order to remove the 
molecule from depth to surface the work opposite this resultant 
force must be performed. The internal energy of the body is 
proportional to the area of the surface and therefore is known as 
the surface energy. Owing to the tendency of molecules to go into 
the bulk of a liquid from its surface the liquid acquires such a 
shape that its free surface has minimum possible area. In all cases 
the interaction of a solid with a drop is weak as compared  to  that 
forces acting among the parts of a liquid and the tendency of the 
liquid to reduce its surface is clearly manifested;  the spherical 
shape of the drops corresponds to their minimum surface area. 
When drops are small the effect of the forces of gravity distorting 
their shape is insignificant. 
The surface energy per unit surface area is called the surface 
tension and denoted by    . In order to increase the surface of a 
liquid by  A  units of area without changing the state ( for example 
 144 
the temperature ) of the liquid the work equal to A   must be 
done: 
= W / A   .                                ( 10.1 ) 
 
Another definition states that a surface tension is a force exerted 
by the surface layer per unit length of the contour bounding this 
layer: 
 = F / l     .                                ( 10.2 ) 
  
In the SI system surface tension is measured in newton per meter ( 
N/ m). 
Surface tension may be determined by measuring the force, 
which should be applied to increase the surface area of liquids; for 
this aim the wire frame  is used. 
 
 
                                                     
§10.2. Excess pressure 
 
Under acting of forces of surface tension the surface layer is 
curved and exerts excess pressure p relative to the external 
pressure. Resultant force is 
directed towards the curvature 
centre. Using the  ( 10.1 ) the 
excess pressure within spherical 
drops of liquid and of gas 
bubbles within liquid may be 
calculated as follows: to increase 
the surface area of sphere 
(Fig.10.1b ) the work equal to 
increment of surface  
energy must be performed:                                 Fig.10.1      
 
W= A= r + r  2  4 r2     
     
 145 
since   r2   2 r r   we have  
 
W= 8 rr    .                               ( 10.3 ) 
 
By the other hand, the work done is 
 
W=F r = pV= pAr = 4pr2  r   .              ( 10.4 )   
 
Equating the expressions we obtain 
 
  p=
2 
r

   .                                   ( 10.5 )  
 
Surface tension  is decreased with increase in  temperature and 
vanishes at the critical temperature. 
 
 
§10.3. Wetting  and  nonwetting 
 
These phenomena may be observed at the boundary of 
contacting  different medium. 
Let us consider the behavior of drops of liquid over the surface of 
solid: 
 Wetting is characterized by means of quantity 
 
cos=(  32     13     21   . 
here the angle   is between solid’s surface and tangent to the 
surface                     of liquid. It is called contact angle. 
Let us consider the following cases: 
1.  32     13        ( Fig.10.2 )   Then force of interaction  
among molecules of liquid and solid are greater as compared to  
the  force   between molecules of solid and gas  ( wetting ).   In 
this case the surface of solid is called hydrophil. 
 146 
2.  32     13            ( Fig. 10.2 )  This case is called 
nonwetting and  the surface of solid is known as  hydrophob. 
3.  32       13    21            Then intermolecular forces 
are completely compensated and the drops .spread out on the 
surface of solid, forming monomolecular layer. This case is called 
ideal wetting. 
 
 
                                         
Fig.10.2 
 
 
§10.4. Capillarity 
 
In narrow tube the edges of the liquid form the entire surface 
of the liquid so that the surface has the shape resembling a 
hemisphere ( meniscus ). In wetting liquids the meniscus is 
concave upwards, while in nonwetting liquids it is convex 
downwards. The surface of the liquid becomes  curved due to 
difference in pressure: the pressure under the concave meniscus is 
lower than under the flat surface. Therefore, if the meniscus is 
concave, the liquid rising up to the hydrostatic pressure 
compensates the pressure difference. From Fig. 10.3  it is seen 
that r=R / cos  , where R  radii of capillary tube. Therefore we 
have  p=2  cos  / R. 
Then     gh = 2  cos  / R

takes the forms

CHAPTER 11 
 
Static  electricity 
 
 
§11.1. Electric charge. Law of conservation  
of electric charge 
 
A physical quantity owing to which the electrical interaction  
occurs  is  known as  electric charge.  The existence of two types 
of electric charges is suggested. One  of  these is  positive and   
other  is negative. Like charges repel each other and unlike 
charges attract each other.  Electric charges are measured by 
means of  device called  electrometer. It   consists of metal shank 
and needle which may rotate about horizontal axis. 
Numerous experiments have showed, that electric charges 
equal in magnitude and opposite in sign  arise as a result of 
electrization upon conductor over the objects. Appearance and 
disappearance of electric charges over the objects are explained in 
more cases by the transitions of elementary charged particles  
electrons from one to another.  
The SI unit of charge is  the coulomb (C)  One coulomb is 
defined as the charge flowing through  the cross section of a wire  
with a  current  one  ampere per sec: 
1 C=1A x 1sec. 
The coulomb is the amount of charge found on 6.25  10 18 
electrons. 
 149 
1 micro  coulomb   ( 1 C ) = 10 6 C. 
1 nano –coulomb (nC) = 10-9 C. 
1 pico  coulomb (pC) = 10 12 C. 
In the closed system the algebraic sum of electric charges of all 
objects remains constant upon any interactions:  
 
q1 + q2 + q3 + … + qn = const.  
 
This equation expresses law of conservation of electric charge. 
 
§ 11.2.Interaction of electric charges. 
Coulombs law 
 
  The first quantitative 
measurement  of the force 
between two electric  
charges was first made by 
a Augustin de Coulomb.  
Coulomb s  law states  :  
A force between two point 
charges is directly  
proportional to the 
product  of the 
magnitudes  of the 
charges  and inversely  
proportional to the square  
of the distance between 
them.  In the  SI system Coulomb s                Fig.11.1 
law  is  mathematically   written as:

where  r  is  measured in meters F in newtons and  q1 , q2  in 
coulombs. Here 0 =8,85x10 12     222 /s ec mA     is the electric  
constant:  This force is directed along the line of connecting 
 charged objects. Like charges exert forces  of repulsion ( Fig. 
11.1a,b;    F  0, such as q1q2   0 )  and unlike charges exert  
forces of attraction  ( Fig.11.1c,d ; F  0, such as q1q2  0 ) 
                                
 
§ 11.3. Electric field. Electric field strength. 
Superposition principle 
 
According to Michael Faraday the interaction between charges 
q1 and q2 separated by some distance is explained by introducing 
the electric field concept: the charge q produces an electric field in 
the  space surrounding 
it and the field interacts 
with a charge q which 
is brought  in the field 
and produces  a force F 
on it. 
A physical quantity 
determined as the ratio 
of force acting on the                                 Fig.11.2 
point electric charge to the 
 value of this charge is called the electric strength of field. If force 
experienced by a point positive charge q 2 in an electric field of   
q1  is F , then  
  
E= 
2q
F
  .                                   ( 11.2 ) 
 
Using the Coulomb’s law we obtain an expression of a 
magnitude of  electric field strength  at some point of space:

E =

4  r0
2 
  .                             ( 11.3 ) 
 
 Intensity is a vector quantity. If  q  0 then  field lines are 
directed towards the charge (Fig.11.2a,) if q  0  then field lines 
are  directed apart the charge ( Fig. 11.2b  ). 
If the different charged particles produce electric fields with 
intensities E 1, E 2, E 3  and etc. at the given point of space, then 
the resultant vector of intensity is equal to the vector  sum of

In particular , (Fig.11.3a) if the vectors coincide then

Spherical shell of charge.  Electric field  inside  a uniform

§11. 4. Conductors in an electric field 
 
 Conductors are the  substances, in which a regular movement 
of  electric charges may occur or the electric current can carried 
out. 
If the metal conductor is placed in an electric field then a 
regular movement will be added to the irregular movement of 
electrons and those will remove in opposite direction to the field 
intensity lines.  
Electrons in a metal conductor will be redistributed under the 
action of an external  electrostatic field so, that field intensity E 
will be equal to zero within of it: E=0. Uncompensated charges 
are distributed over the outer surface of a charged object. 
A phenomenon of charge redistribution in a conductor is due to 
an  electrostatic field and is   called  electrostatic induction. 
If the conductor has an internal cavity then the field intensity 
within  it is equal to zero independent whether the conductor is 
charged or not. The internal cavity in the conductor is screened 
from external electrostatic fields. 
Potentials    ( sec. 3 1.6 ) of all points within conductor are 
identical. Surfaces of charged conductor serves to be equipotential 
surfaces where potentials of all points are equal. 
 
 
§11.5. Electric dipole.  
 
  A system of two unlike charges, equal in magnitude  and 
placed at a distance one from another is called  electric dipole. 
(Fig.11.5a)  Dipole s electric field intensity  E is equal to the 
geometrical sum of individual intensities  produced by each of 
charges (Fig.11.5b).

where l  is the distance between the charges. The vector of p 
is directed from   q  to   q.   
 
§11.6. Work done by electrostatic field.  
Potential and difference in potentials 
 
1. A work done upon removing of positive charge between 
points 1 and 2 in homogeneous field with intensity E is 
equal to  
W=  qE( x2  x1)  ,                       ( 11.13 ) 
 
where x1 and x2 are the x axis

coordinates of points 1 and 2 respectively (Fig.11.6a). Sign of  
minus indicates that a directions of force and displacement are 
opposite. Work performed upon the removing of charge is 
independent on the kind of trajectory and depends only on initial 
and finally positions of charge. Thus, the works performed upon 
removing over the trajectories 1  2 and 1 2  3 are equal.  
2. Work  done upon the removing of charge between points B 
and C is equal to

where r1 and r2 are the distances of points B and C from charge q. 
The work performed by electrostatic forces, when a charge 
removes along the closed trajectory is equal to zero(Fig.11.6b). 
A physical quantity equal to the ratio of potential energy of 
charge and  its magnitude  is called the potential of electric field.  
Potential is measured also by the work done to remove the unit 
positive charge from  Earth’ s surface to infinity.

Hence it follows that  electric potential due to single charge  q

Electric potential is a scalar quantity.  If the electric field at 
any point of space is produced by several charges then the 
resultant potential is equal to the algebraic sum of individual 
potentials: 
 
V = V1   V2   . .  Vn  .                ( 11.16 )

 unit charge moves between 
those points.

§11.7. Electric capacitance. Combination of 
capacitors 
 
A device used for storing electric charge is called a capacitor. 
A physical quantity determined as ratio of charge q of single 
conductor to its potential  is called the electric capacitance of 
conductor and characterizes the capability of a capacitor to store 
charge:

Electric capacitance of geometrically similar conductors direct 
proportional to their linear sizes, relative permitivity of medium 
where a conductor is placed. 
A mutual capacitance of two conductors is called a physical 
quantity, which is equal in magnitude to the charge per unit 
difference in potentials.

When two spheres are in contact the electric charge flows from 
one to another up to equality of potentials. Then the sum of 
charges remains unchangeable (conservation of charge). The 
finally charges of spheres one can find using the following 
equations:

 Direct electric current in 
metals 
 
 
§12.1. Electric current. Current density 
 
The orderly motion of charge carriers  (in metals they are 
electrons) is called electric current. The direction of the current is 
defined as the direction opposite to that in which the negative 
charges move. 
The quantity of charge, which flows across any  cross  section 
of the conductor per unit time is called current intensity.

Current  is measured in ampere one of the  basic units  of  SI 
system. 
The ratio of current  to the cross  sectional area of the 
conductor is the current density.

The unit of measurement  of current density in SI system is 
ampere/m2 . 
Current density is related to the concentration n of charge 
carriers and their velocities v as follows: 
 
n  e=J ,                               (12.2 ) 
 
where e  is the electric charge of electron which is equal to the 
elementary charge:   e=1.6 1019 C. 
The current  is a scalar quantity, while current density a vector 
quantity. 
 
 
§12.2. Work  done  due to motion  of a charge in 
conductors. Electromotive force. Voltage 
 
 When a charge moves along the conductor a work is 
performed by the  both coulomb and  outside forces. 
 
W=Wcoul. + Wout. . 
 
Electromotive force is  a quantity numerically equal to the 
work  performed by   outside forces upon removing of positive 
unit charge. 
q

Voltage.  The voltage is a quantity defined as a ratio  of work 
performed upon the movement of positive charge, from one point 
to another to the magnitude of charge. Thus,  by using    formulas   
( 11.17  )  and ( 12.3 ) we get 
 
U= V1  V 2   +    .                         ( 12.4 ) 
 
 165 
If the electric field is nonpotential then a voltage is equal to the 
potentials  difference  between two points. 
 
V= V 1     V 2. 
 
The SI unit  both of voltage and difference in potentials is volt    
(V) . 
Relationship between voltage  and field  intensity  is given by 
the expression: 
V=Ed ,                              (12.5 ) 
 
where d  is the distance between electrodes. 
 
 
§12.3.  Ohms law  for a section of circuit.   
Resistance and    resistivity

proportional to the potential difference and inverse proportional to 
the resistance: 
R
V
=I                                      (12.6 ) 
 
where R is the resistance depending upon the type of material, its 
geometry  and temperature. Resistance is measured in ohm: 1 
ohm=1 V / 1A. Resistance of cylindrical wire is calculated by the 
formula: 
A
l
=R                                    (12.7 ) 
 
where l  the length of a wire, A  the  cross  sectional area,   
is the resistivity. Unit of measurement of resistivity is ohm x 
meter (ohm m). 
Resistivity is a function of temperature as follows: 
 166 
    0  1+   t   ,                    (12.8 )

§12.4. Combination of resistors 
 
 a)  Connection in series . 
 When two or more 
wires are connected in 
series (Fig.12.2a )  
The current power 
flowing through  
individual wires is the 
same: 
 
II= ... II n21   (12.9) 
 
In this case the voltage 
at the ends of wire is equal 
to the sum of  voltages of 
individual wires:

 167 
nV+ ... VV=V 21                     ( 12. 10 ) 
 
The equivalent resistance is determined as the sum of 
individual resistances: 
n21ser. R+ ... RRR                   ( 12.11 ) 
 
If the individual resistances are identical  then 
 
nRR ser.  ,                           ( 12.12 ) 
 
where   n the number of resistors  in series. 
In this type of connection the voltages of conductors are  
directly  proportional to their  resistances:

When wires are connected in parallel (Fig.12.2b) the voltage at 
the ends of individual wires are the same: 
 
V n21 V= ... VV  .                  ( 12.14 ) 
 
In this case the total current  is equal to the sum of individual 
current powers: 
 
n21 I + ... II=I      .              ( 12. 15 )

§12.5. Ohm s law   for  a  closed  circuit 
 
A motion of charge q over 
the closed circuit is due to the 
work  W performed by the 
exterior forces. A ratio of this 
work to the magnitude of 
charge q is called the 
electromotive force (e.m.f. )

E.m.f. is measured in SI system in volts ( V ). 
Power of current flowing in closed circuit can be found by the 
Ohm s law: 
 169 
I =
r+R

    ,                         ( 12.19 ) 
where      the e.m.f. of current source, r  the internal 
resistance, R  the external resistance. 
The expression ( 12.19  ) can be written as  
 
  = IR + Ir   .                         (12..20 ) 
 
The right side of final expression is the sum of voltage drop in 
an external circuit as well as in source. Thus the e.m.f. is equal to 
voltage drop across the entire circuit: 
 
 = UR + Ur . 
 
When the external resistance R=0 the current power takes 
greatest value which is called the  short circuit. 
 
I =
r

  . 
 
When the resistors R 1 and R 2  are connected with the current 
source then the e.m.f.  and internal resistance are found by means 
of system of equations: 
 = I1 ( R1 + r  )   ,                      ( 12.21 ) 
 
  = I2 ( R2 + r )  , 
 
where I1 , I2  are  the current powers  in resistors  R1 and R2 
respectively. 
If the powers liberated in currents I1 and I2 are P1 and P2 
respectively then   and  r are found using the system of equations

emf is  equal to the sum of individual emf (Fig. 12.4a) 
 
 
Fig.12.4 
 
When the emf sources are connected in parallel total  emf is 
found by subtracting and when the emf sources are connected in 
series total emf is found by adding the individual emf. 
 
§12.6.  Multi-loop circuits.  Kirchoffs rules 
 
The electric circuit is a complex of conductors and sources of 
currents. In general case the circuit is multiloop and has the 
branch points.  To calculate the current powers of each section in 
branched circuits the  both rules of points and contours are used: 
1. Kirchoffs  first rule.  
Consider any section of arbitrary branched circuit. Let the  
branched point be A. From the condition that current is constant  it 
 171 
follows, that a quantity of charge entering into point A per sec is 
equal to the charge  flowing  from A per sec. In other words, the 
sum of currents flowing into  a point is equal to the sum of 
currents flowing from point. For the point A from Fig.12.5.a  we  
obtain:  
 
                                             Fig.12.5 
 
I + I3  I   I1 = 0 .                     ( 12.24 ) 
 
Algebraic sum of all currents at the   point  A  is equal to zero. 
 
2. Kirchoffs  second rule.  
  Let us apply the Ohms law to individual current loops  of 
ABC circuit ( Fig.12.5b )  First choose the reference direction of 
closed circuit. We will consider that the  e.m. forces creating the 
currents in the direction of reference are positive, e.m.f which 
create opposite  currents are negative. 
All currents, coinciding with the reference direction of closed 
circuit are positive. Sign of voltage drop is determined by  the sign 
of current, flowing through the resistors. 
Suppose,  VA , V B ,  V C   are the potentials of points A, B, C 
respectively. Then  we  can write: 
 172 
V B   VA  +  I1R 1 =  1 , 
VC  V B   I 2 R 2 =   2 ,                  ( 12.25 ) 
VA   VC  +  I 3R 3 =   3 , 
 
where I1 ,  I2 ,  I3   the  currents, R 1 , R 2 ,  R 3  the  resistances,  
 1,  2 ,   3  electromotive forces of corresponding circuits.  
Summation  of  equations  above  gives   
 
I1R 1   I 2 R 2  +  I 3R 3  =   1 +  2    3    .     ( 12.26 ) 
 
As can be seen an algebraic sum of voltage drops in the  closed 
circuit is equal to the algebraic sum of e.m.f. acting in this circuit. 
This is the  Kirchoff s second rule .

CHAPTER 13  
 
Current in various media   
 
 
§13.1. Current in electrolytes.  Ohms  law 
 
Substances  whose solutions   are carrying  out  the electric  
current are known as electrolytes. Electric  current in electrolytes    
is  due to motion of  ions .Pure  water and crystals of copper 
chloride do not carry out the current, however  solution of copper 
chloride  is considered to be a good conductor. 
When  current flows through the solution the chlorine is 
liberated  on the positive electrode while  copper is liberated on 
the negative electrode. 
Density  of current   due to  ions of both signs  is given by 
 
j=n+ e  + +  n e      ,                   ( 13. 1 ) 
 
where n ( n ) is the concentration of positive ( negative ) ions,  
   (   ) the drift velocities of the positive(negative ) ions, and  
 e  is  the charge of electron,   The mobility of ions is defined as 
the average drift velocity  attained by ion  in a field of 1V/cm 
strength.  
                                               u =

 175 
The current density can be expressed in terms of ion mobilities  
u  and  u : 
J =  n u + n u  eE  .                   ( 13.3 ) 
 
This expression is called the Ohm s law for electrolytes. 
 
 
§13.2.  Electrolysis. Faradays laws 
 
 The process of decomposition of an electrolyte by an electric 
current is called electrolysis. 
Faradays  first law: The mass of any substance liberated at 
the electrode  as a result of electrolysis is proportional to the total 
quantity of charge q passed  through  electrolyte: 
 
m=kq       or      m=kIt   ,                   ( 13. 4 ) 
 
where k  is called the electrochemical equivalent and is 
numerically equal to the mass of a given substance liberated when 
unit positive charge passes through electrolyte. 
Faradays  second law: The electrochemical equivalent of a 
given substance is proportional to its  chemical equivalent: 
 
k=
 ZF
A 1
 ,                                   ( 13. 5 ) 
 
where Fis called Faraday’ s constant, which is the quantity of 
electric charge equal in round numbers to 96.500 coulombs, Z-
indicates the valence. If this quantity of charges passes through a 
solution of an electrolyte a mass of substance equal to the 
chemical equivalent of the substance will be liberated. The 
quantity 
A
Z
  is defined as the ratio of the atomic weight of an 
element to its valence and is called  chemical equivalent. 
 176 
Finally,  general law of electrolysis is written as follows: 
 
m=

§13.3.  Electric current in gases. Types of  electric 
discharge 
 
Thermionic ionization.  
A gas becomes a conductor  as a  result of heating, therefore 
any fraction  of its atoms or molecules is converted into ions. 
In order to remove  electron from the atom a certain  work 
opposed to  the coulomb  attraction between nucleus and electrons 
must be done. The process of liberation of electron from atom is 
called the  ionization. The minimum energy required to remove 
electron from an  atom is called the binding energy. 
Electrons may escape from atoms, when two atoms strike one 
another and their kinetic energy exceeds the binding energy of 
electron. The kinetic energy of heat movement of electrons is 
directly proportional to  the temperature. The appearance of free 
electrons and positive ions   as a result of collisions  between 
 177 
atoms and molecules at high temperatures is called the thermionic 
ionization.  
  Induced discharge.  
A substance in gas state is usually insulated, because of its  
atoms or molecules  are consisted of the equal number of negative 
and positive electric charges and therefore totally are neutral. By 
means of experiments is shown that gas may become a conductor. 
The phenomenon of the  passage of an  electric current through 
a gas, observed only under  of any external action other than an 
electric field (for example. heating, X rays, etc.) is called an 
induced discharge. 
Induced gas discharge is characterized with the dependence of 
current  I versus voltage U 
between electrodes. In 
Fig.13.1 the curve OCA is 
called the volt-ampere 
characteristics. The value 
of current  Isat. independent 
the voltage  is called 
saturated current. Isat. =e 
N0 where N0  the 
maximum number of pair 
of single valence ions, 
produced per unit volume                          Fig.13.1 
and time. The AB part is related  to  the bombardment ionization. 
Plasma.     A gas in which a sufficient number of atoms and 
molecules are ionized is called a plasma. It is characterized with 
the   ionization power which is determined by the ratio of 
concentration of charged particles to the number  of total 
concentration. The  ionization power of plasma depends on 
temperature. Electrons and ions of plasma can be removed under 
action of an electric field. Thus, gas serves to be an insulator at 
low temperatures and is converted into plasma at high 
temperatures and becomes a conductor. 
Depending  on ionization  degree  a plasma may be: 
 178 
a ) weak ionized 
b ) partially ionized 
c ) perfect ionized. 
Intrinsic discharge. When  a strength of electric field E in gas  
increases up to  definite value a current independent on external 
ionizators  appears. This phenomenon is called intrinsic 
discharge. 
The basic mechanism of ionization of gas during intrinsic 
discharge is the ionization  of atoms and molecules due to 
bombardment by electrons. This kind of ionization becomes 
possible when an electron acquires over free path the energy, 
exceeding the binding energy W with atom. 
Kinetic energy acquired  due to  electric field is equal to the 
work done by it 
E k  =F l =eE l , 
 
where  l  is the mean free path. 
 From  the condition for  ionization it follows   
 
eE l  W  . 
 
Binding energy is usually expressed in electronvolts (eV ). An 
electronvolt is  the energy acquired by an electron when it passes  
through 1 volt  potential difference. 
 
W=eV 
 
1 eV=1.6 10 19 C   1V =1.6  10 19 Joule. 
 
Mechanism of intrinsic discharge  
An increase of the intrinsic discharge in gas  occurs by the 
following way.  Free electron acquires an acceleration due to 
action of electric field. If the field  strength is  higher,  electrons 
increase their kinetic energy over free passing so, that it can 
ionizate the molecule upon collisions. 
 179 
The former electron which causes ionization of the  molecule 
and the second escaped electron  acquire an acceleration directed 
from cathode towards anode. Each of those electrons may liberate 
one electron upon collisions, thus total number of free electrons 
becomes equal to four. Further they can reached up to 8, 16, 32 
and etc. 
The number of free electrons moving from cathode towards 
anode rises avalanche like while they reach anode. Positive ions 
appeared  in gas move from the  anode toward the cathode due to 
electric field action. New electrons may be liberated from the 
cathode as a  result of bombardments of latter by the positive ions 
and due to light  radiated in discharge process. These electrons are 
accelerated by electric field and produce in  their turn a new 
electron ion avalanche. Therefore  the process may be continued 
uninterruptedly. 
Concentration of ions in plasma increases with  rising in 
intrinsic discharge and a resistance of discharge band decreases. 
Current  in   intrinsic discharge circuit is usually determined only 
by internal resistance of source. 
 
Spark discharge  
  If the current source is not able to support the intrinsic 
discharge for long time then the occurred  intrinsic discharge is 
called spark discharge. A lightning is a good example of spark 
discharge. Current  in lightning channel reaches up to (1 2) 10 4 
A and pulse  duration is measured in microseconds. With  rising 
of current   in a lightning channel a heating of plasma reaches up 
to temperatures more than 10 5 K. A change in pressure of plasma 
channel of lightning with the rising of current  causes the sound 
phenomenon, called  thunder.  
Grow discharge  
When a gas pressure in a discharge gap is decreased the 
discharge channel becomes more widely and discharge tube is 
homogeneously is filled. This type of intrinsic discharge is called 
a grow discharge. 
 180 
 
Arc discharge 
If the current  in an intrinsic gas discharge is sufficient, then 
bombardments of positive ions and electrons may cause a heating 
of both cathode and anode. At high temperatures, emission of 
electrons occurs, which provides the bearing of  intrinsic 
discharge. Long time intrinsic electric discharge supported due to 
thermionic emission from the cathode’s surface is referred to as  
arc discharge. 
 
Corona discharge. 
 A special type of intrinsic discharge  called corona discharge 
appears in powerful inhomogeneous electric fields created, for 
example, between corona and plane, or  between conductor and 
plane.  An ionization due to electron bombardments upon the 
corona discharge  occurs only near one of the  electrodes, where  
electric field  strength  is highest. 
 
 
§13.4.  Current in vacuum.  Diode. Triode 
 
Vacuum is called the state of gas in which the collisions 
between gas molecules can be neglected. In this state the  
electron’ s mean free path exceeds the linear sizes of vessel ( l  
d). A concentration of molecules in vacuum state is so small, that 
ionization processes can not provide for the required number of 
electrons and positive ions for electric current conduction. 
Conduction between electrodes in vacuum may be supported by 
means of charged particles produced due to thermionic emission 
phenomeneon. 
Kinetic energy  gained by electron during its passage  from 
surface of cathode to anode is equal to the work  done by an 
electric field.

Thermionic emission is used in various electron equipments, 
like as diode, triode and vacuum tube. Vacuum diode  consists of 
two electrodes  ( Fig.13.2a): 
cathode and anode. Its basic property is unipolarity conduction. 
When a current source is connected  up with positive pole to the 
 182 
anode and with negative to the cathode the electrons emitted by 
heated cathode move to the anode, the direct thermionic current IA 
flows in circuit.  A dependence I A on the voltage between 
electrodes V is called the volt ampere characteristics  (Fig.13.2b). 
Current  at the constant temperature depends on the dimensions 
and mutual displacement of electrons, work junction of electron s 
work junction from cathode and its temperature. At small values 
of VA current  IA slowly increases with rising of VA . It is  
explained as follows:  when VA is small not of all electrons 
liberated from cathode can reach the anode. Any portion of 
electrons produces an electron cloud  between cathode and anode. 
This negative charge opposes the electron’s motion. With increase  
in VA the electron cloud  and current  I increases. When VA=V sat. 
current I reaches the maximum value. This value is called 
saturated current. If N is the number of electrons emitted from 
the cathode s surface per unit time at the given temperature, then I 
sat.=Ne.  If the positive  terminal will be connected  up to the 
cathode and the negative  terminal to the anode, then the electric 
field will cancel the motion of electrons;  current will disappear. 
This property is used to convert the alternating current into   direct 
one. 
Triode.  In triode the controlling grid between cathode and 
anode is placed ( Fig.13.3a). Dependence of I versus U at the 
given value of  
VA is called  grid characteristic. of  lamp  (Fig.13.3b). If the V 
 0 the electrons move to the anode with great speeds, more than 
speed at V =0. If V  0    field of ...   ... the electric field between 
anode and cathode and both of electron’s speed and anode current 
decrease. 
 183 
 
                                           Fig.13.3 
 
The negative   GV  voltage at which the anode current is totally 
can cancel out . It is called the stopping voltage. It rises with 
increasing of anode voltage. Thus  change in  the  grid  voltage  
can regulate   the current of  triode.. 
A vacuum tube contains a pair of metal electrodes . When a 
high voltage is applied across the electrodes, a stream of electrons 
moves across the tube from the negative electrode (cathode) to the 
positive electrode (anode). 
 
§13.5.  Energy band theory. Conductors. 
Insulators 
 
Energy bands give an 
explanation of the electri-
cal classification of solids. 
In case the highest energy 
band is unfilled the 
electrons can be excited 
from lower to higher 
energy level within the 
band. (Fig.13.4) 
Fig.13.4 
 
 184 
This is possible on application of even weak electric fields. A 
material with such  energy band is a conductor. There are some 
materials in which valence  and conduction bands overlap hence, 
electron from the valence shell can easily pass into conduction 
band. They are also conductors.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
                                            Fig.13.5 
 
In an insulator, the highest occupied energy level is 
completely filled.  Also the forbidden energy band above the 
occupied band is wide. The electron cannot jump  from lower to 
upper permissible energy  levels.( Fig.13.5)  
 
 
§13.6. Semiconductors 
 
 Another category of solids is semiconductor. Here the gap 
between the filled energy band and next higher permitted energy 
band is small. The thermal energy, even at room temperature, is 
sufficient to allow  some electrons from lower permitted band to 
pass to the upper permitted band.(Fig.13.6) The examples of semi 
conductors are Germanium and Silicon which belong to fourth 
group of Periodic Table.  They have four electrons in their 
 185 
outermost shell called valence electrons. The valence electrons of 
each of these atoms are shared in pairs with four adjacent atoms. 
( Fig.13.7)  
 
                                       
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Fig.13.6 
 
A  pure semiconductor behaves like an insulator at temperature 
near absolute zero because the valence electrons of each atom are 
tightly held in covalent bonds with neighbor atoms. As the 
temperature rises to ambient range,  the atom and the electrons 
absorb thermal energy. This energy appears as random vibration 
or agitation of these particles about their lattice locations. So, 
some electrons become free and mobile by acquiring sufficient 
energy to break the covalent bond. The energy required to break a 
covalent bond may also be provided by high voltage across the 
material or by exposing the material to photons of proper 
wavelength.  When the bond is broken and an electron is free 
thereby, electron vacancy is left in the covalent bond. The vacant 
electron site is called a hole.  The hole represents the absence of 
negative charge and is attractive to                               
 electrons. The hole appears to have a positive charge equal to the 
negative charge of electron in magnitude.   
 186 
The  hole also appears to be mobile..  A broken covalent bond 
has left a hole at the site A.. Another electron may move from a 
bond at the site B to the hole at A, under the force of a small 
voltage applied across the 
material. 
When the electron fills 
the hole at the site A, then 
there is now a hole at the 
site B.  Then another 
electron may move from a 
bond at the site C to the 
hole at the site B and the 
hole thus moves to the site 
C. Similarly, an electron 
may move from a bond at 
the site D to hole at the 
site C and so the hole has        Fig.13.7 
moved from A to D. 
In order to obtain the desired conduction properties, the pure 
Silicon or Germanium is doped with minute amount of selected 
elements as controlled impurities. The impurities are added at the 
rates of one atom of doping element to 105 to 108 atoms of 
semiconductor. When the 5-th group element like Antimony is 
added to the Germanium crystal we have the n - type material. In 
an n - type semiconductor the conduction will be predominantly 
by electrons and the electrons are called the majority carriers. 
There will be a few holes present in n - type material due to 
electron hole pair generation at usual ambient temperatures. The 
holes present in an n type material are known as the minority 
carriers. The use of trivalent impurity elements has created a 
material with free holes, so conduction occurs by hole transfer and 
impurity semiconductor is said to be  p-type  material. The 
trivalent impurity atoms accept electrons to fill their bond 
vacancies and are called acceptor atoms and the impurities as 
acceptor impurities.  
 187 
The conduction in a p-type   material will be primarily due to 
holes and they are known as majority carriers. There will be  
present electrons in a p-type material due to thermal pair 
generation. These electrons in a p-type material are known as 
minority carriers. 
 
§ 13.7. Semi-conductor diode 
 
   A junction between p and  n materials forms a semi-
conductor diode as shown in Fig. 13.8a. It contains donor   
impurities on one side and acceptor impurities on the other side of 
a single crystal of Germanium or silicon during the   process of its 
growth.  
Initially there are holes (majority carriers) to the left of the 
junction and free electron to the right. A diffusion of electrons and 
holes takes place across the junction which stops after setting up a 
potential difference at the junction, the n-type being at a positive 
potential with respect to p-type as shown in Fig.13.8b 
  The semi-conductor diode has the property of one way  
conduction ,i,e,. it allows the current to flow only in one direction. 
The flow of current is practically zero in the opposite direction; it 
acts as a diode. Thus, if we want to send the current across a p-n 
junction, we have to reduce the 
height of the potential barrier at 
the junction. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
     Fig.13.8 
         Fig.13.9 
 188 
This can be done by connecting the p-type material of the 
junction with positive terminal of the battery and n-type with 
negative terminal as shown in Fig.13.9  The height of potential  
barrier  has been reduced and the resistance offered by it 
decreases. It gives easy way to flow of electric current. In this 
case the diode is said to be forward biased. The depletion region is 
narrowed. 
On the other hand, if the n-type material of the junction is 
connected to positive terminal of the battery and p-type with 
negative terminal, the height of potential barrier at the  junction                           
increases and it offers a very high resistance. (Fig.13.10) This 
makes the flow of current quite difficult across the p-n junction. In 
this state the diode is said to be reverse biased and practically no 
current flows in the circuit. The  depletion region is widened in 
this case.         
The characteristic of a diode is simply the relation between 
current and potential 
difference represented by a 
graph, showing the forward 
and reverse biasing of the 
diode  respectively. 
(Fig.13.11.) 
Thus the diode can act as a 
switch. It is due to this 
important property of diode,                             
that it can be used for 
rectification, i,e., to convert 
alternating current into

most of the electronic devices  
the diode serves as a rectifier..                          Fig.13.10

§13.8. Semi-conductor  transistor 
 
Transistors are  of two types i.e., p-n-p or n-p-n transistors. In a 
p-n-p transistor, n-type material is sandwiched between two p-
type materials Fig.13.12a 
In the second type, p-type material lies in between two n-type 
materials (Fig.13.12b)  The central portion of the transistor is 
known as base ( B ) and the regions on the left hand side and right 
are called emitter ( E ) and collector (C) respectively. The emitter 
is more heavily doped than the collector with the same impurities. 
These three portions of the 
transistor form two junctions, 
i.e., emitter –base junction 
(also knows as emitter 
junction) and collector-base 
junction (also known as 
collection junction). For 
normal operations the emitter-
base junction is forward-
biased and collector-base 
junction  is   reverse-biased  as   Fig.13.11 
shown in Fig. 13.13. 
 Emitter and collector are at lower potentials with respect to 
base. On this condition no current can flow from emitter to base or 
collector to base.                              
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
              Fig.13.12                                              Fig.13.13

A small ac power source connected to the input produces 
changes in the base current. This produces much larger changes in 
the collector current. The collector current flowing through the 
load R produces a voltage drop. Under this condition the above 
circuit operates as  an amplifier. 
Transistor can be used as oscillators, switches, memory units 
and perform many other useful functions. 
 
§13.9.  Superconductivity 
 
 Falling in the temperature of a material reduces the thermal 
vibrations of the lattice ion and hence a decrease in the resistance 
can be observed in metal. It is, however, difficult to make the 
resistivity and hence the resistance, exactly equal to zero with 
temperature. A class of elements called superconductors show a 
remarkable variation in electrical resistivity with temperature as 
shown in Fig. 13.14   
One can observe 
in this figure that at a 
certain critical 
temperature TC 
(Curie temperature) 
the value of 
resistivity falls with 
shift to zero. For 
example, the value of                              Fig.13.14 
 resistance of some elements falls  
to zero below 7. 175 K    At such temperatures, the ions are frozen 
at the lattice sites and therefore do not scatter or hinder the motion 
of electrons in a superconductor.

Magnetism 
 
 
§14.1. The magnetic field. Magnetic moment.    
Magnetic field induction 
 
       Magnetic field is one of the two  parts of electromagnetic 
field. Its  basic feature  is  to be  produced by the current carrying 
conductors, moving electric charged particles , as well as by 
magnetized objects and time-varying electric fields. Appearance 
of magnetic field  
around the  current 
carrying wire was 
observed in  
Oersteds 
experiment. One 
of the wires used 
by him was laying across                             Fig.14.1 
 the top of a small compass. When he sent a current through the 
wire the compass needle moved. A compass needle is a small 
magnet. The magnetic field around a magnet will                              
interact only with another magnetic field. Thus the presence of an 
electric current in the wire was somehow causing a magnetic field  
around the wire. The electric current and magnetic field cannot be 
separated. 
 192 
  Magnetic moment Pm of  current carrying plane loop 
(Fig.14.1a)   is  a  vector  defined by  
 
0nIAPm

   ,                               ( 14. 1 ) 
 
where A area  limited by the loop, I - current intensity ,  n0 unit 
vector, normal to the surface. 
   Force characteristic of magnetic field is the induction vector B 
. If the  current currying rectangular loop is placed in external 
magnetic field the torque exerted on  it is equal to  
 
M=PmBsin    ,                         ( 14. 2) 
 
where B -the magnetic induction vector and  - the angle between 
the vectors Pm  and B (Fig.14.1b) Magnitude of B is determined  
by the greatest value of  torque  Mmax.:  
 
B=

M

maxmax  .                      ( 14. 3 ) 
If  /2)(     , the magnetic induction lines are on the plane of 
loop and its magnetic moment Pm is perpendicular to the induction 
lines B. This situation is  called the unstability equilibrium. The 
condition in which the plane of loop is perpendicular to the 
induction lines is  the steady equilibrium. 
        The unit of magnetic induction in the CGSM is the Gaus, in 
the system SI is tesla (T). 
         A tesla ( T) is defined as the induction  of magnetic field that 
acts  with  newton-meter(Nm) revolving torque on the current  
currying loop  of area 1m2   whose current is equal to  1 ampere.   
        1 T=1 
mA
N
;       1 Gauss = 104 T. 
A magnetic induction  B is related  intensity  H of magnetic field 
by    
B=H  , 
 193 
where  is the relative magnetic permeability of the medium. 
Unit of magnetic intensity in the SI system is  
m
A
 
 
§14.2.  Magnetic flux 
  
  Flux of magnetic induction   across the surface of small  area  
A (Fig.14.2 )  is the scalar quantity, determined as  
 
cosBA                                 ( 14. 4 ) 
 
where  -is the angle 
between vectors B and n0. 
Hence the magnetic field 
equals the flux per unit 
area across an area at right 
angle to the magnetic field. 
Magnetic flux is positive     Fig.14.2 
when  /2)(     and it is                              
negative  when  /2)(   . Magnetic flux may change because of:                                                           
 1)  Reorientation of plane loops surface relative the direction of 
induction B: 
 
=BS(cos2  cos1)  . 
 
2)    A change of the sizes of  area A: 
 
=BAcos= B (A2 A1 )cos  . 
 
3)    A change in magnetic  induction B : 
 
=BAcos = (B2 B1 )Acos  . 
 
 194 
        Change in magnetic induction B may be caused by variation 
in    field intensity H and magnetic permeability . 
        The unit of magnetic flux in the CGSM system is the  
maxwell (mks), in the SI system the weber(Wb):  1Wb = Nm A1.  
 
 
§14.3.  Biot and Savarts law. Magnetic field due to

given point. (Fig.14.3 )                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
The quantity  il is called  current          Fig.14.3

point.                        Fig.14.4

§14.4. Magnetic fields  due to  long straight current,

magnetic permeability of a

Direction of wires magnetic field is determined by means of 
left hand rule: if the thumb of the  left hand is placed along the 
wire pointing in the direction of the current, the curled fingers 
of the  left hand will point in the direction of the magnetic 
lines of force.

Solenoid.  A saolenoid is constructed by winding wire in a helix 
around a cylindrical surface ( Fig.14.6). The magnetic field of the 
solenoid of length l  is defined  as  
 
B=  0 nI  ,                    ( 14. 9 ) 
 
where n=N / l-the number of turns  
per unit length of   solenoid and 
each turn carries a current I.  
   The direction of B is along the 
axis of the solenoid.                                        Fig.14.7                         
 
Toroid.    A toroid is a solenoid that  
has been bent into a circle.  
 ( Fig.14.7). The magnetic field is  given  as  
 
B=  0 nI  ,                          ( 14. 10 ) 
 
where n = N / 2 r  is the number of turns per unit length, and 2 r 
is the circumference  of the toroid. 
 
 
 
§14.5. Force  on the current carrying conductor. 
Amperes law. 
 
On the small piece of the conducting wire of length l placed  in 
the magnetic field  acts the force F (Fig.14.), which is expressed 
by the formula 
 
F=IlBsin  ,                              ( 14. 11 ) 
 
 197 
where   -is the angle between vector B and current direction. 
The force F is perpendicular to the both of wire and vector B and 
is called Amperes force. 
Direction of 
F is determined 
by means of left 
hand rule: 
if the open 
palm of the left 
hand is placed    Fig.14.8  
so that the lines  
of force of the magnetic field enter the palm, while the 
outstretched fingers point in the direction of the current, then 
the thumb will indicate the direction of the force acting on the 
conductor.              
 
 
§14.6.  Interaction between  parallel currents 
 
      Between two 
parallel currents 
bearing conductors 
placed at a distance 
R one from other 
arrise force of 
attraction when the 
currents  represents

§14.7. Motion of charged particle in a magnetic field.   
Lorentzs  force 
 
      If a single charged particle moves  in a magnetic field Lorentz  
s force will exerted on it: 
 
FL=q Bsin   ,                       ( 14. 13 ) 
 
where q- magnitude  of  charge,  -the particle’s velocity,  B-
induction of magnetic 
field, -the angle 
between vectors B 
and   (Fig.14.10) In 
uniform magnetic 
field the vector B is 
perpendicular to the 
vector  . The force FL                             Fig.14.10 
distorts  the   path  of  
motion. The velocity changes only  in direction but not in 
magnitude. A particle makes circular motion on the plane, 
perpendicular to the vector B.  Since the centripetal force Fc is 
given by Fc = m
R

 where R is the radius of the circular path, the  
radius and period of this motion are given by

A period T is regardless on the radius of circle and the velocity of 
the particle. 
      If the charged particle enters into the magnetic field under the 
angle , the motion will  occur  over the curl (Fig.14.11) of radius 
R and step  b  respectively:

    If the particle is simultaneously exerted by both  electric and 
magnetic fields  , the resultant force will be expressed as  
 
FR=fe + fL= qE + q B . ( 14. 16 ) 
 
Suppose, that electron passing 
the potential difference V1V 2, 
has  the velocity   and moves in 
the   magnetic field, force lines of                      Fig.14.11 
which  are  perpendicular  to   the  
vector   . In this case  Lorent’z  force will  act  as centripetal 
force Fc.

Each electron moving within

the magnetic is called the substance which can create their internal

magnetic field. The total magnetic                        
  field existing within of substance 
is characterized by the magnetic 
induction vector which is equal to 
the vector sum of magnetic 
inductions of external Bext.=Hext. 
and internal fields: 
 
B=B int.  + B ext.   .                      ( 14. 20 )                Fig.14.13

Substances, in which  the induced internal field in the existence                     
of external field is opposed to the internal field  are called  
diamagnetic. For diamagnetic   1  Atoms and molecules of 
such substances have not their specific magnetic moments ( Hint.= 
0;  pm = 0 ) in the

absence of external magnetic field. For example, the atom of He is  
diamagnetic. Nucleus of this atom has a charge equal to q=2e. 
Suppose, both of electrons revolve around nucleus over the same  
orbits with the same velocities  in 
opposite directions. Then their 
revolving magnetic moments are 
equal in magnitude and opposite in 
sign.  Fig.14.13    illustrates   that   the  
resultant magnetic moment for atom 
He  is equal to zero. 
       Substance in which induced 
internal field is added to  the external 
field are called paramagnetic,          Fig.14.15                     
       For     paramagnetic      1.    In  
paramagnetic substances the permeability  is varying  with the 
temperature according the dependence  =1+ C / T,  where T - the 
absolute temperature, and C  is Curie constant.  In Fig.14.14  for 
both of paramagnetic (line 1) and diamagnetic (line 2)  
magnetization I is directly proportional to B0. Materials, for which 
  is more greater than unit ( Bint. Bext. hence,  1) are called 
 202 
ferromagnetic. For the ferromagnetic materials a dependence of I 
on the B0 is nonlinear.(Fig.14.14 ) 
       The specific properties of ferromagnetic are observed at 
temperatures, below a certain TC called the Curie temperature. 
When TTC the ferromagnetic properties disappear and the 
ferromagnetic substance becomes paramagnetic.  
   The magnetization of a ferromagnetic material depends, in 
addition to the field intensity, on the magnetic history of the                       
sample: the value of the induction lags behind that of the field 
intensity. This phenomenon is called hysteresis, and the curve 
depicting the dependence of B versus H in the process of 
remagnetization ( Fig.14.15 ) is called a hysteresis loop.                               
       The value of the 
residual magnetic induc-
tion of the ferromagnetic 
material after the 
magnetizing field has 
been reduced to zero and  
is called the retentivity (Br).    Fig.14.16 
        The coercive force ( Hr )  
is the value of the magnetic field intensity needed to reduce the 
residual   induction to zero  (the direction of this field must be 
opposite to that of the retentivity). 
        The saturation  value ( IS ) is the greatest value of the 
magnetization I. When a ferromagnetic material has been 
magnetized up  to the saturation value, further increase of the                               
field intensity will  practically have  no effect on the 
magnetization. 
       At the temperatures T   TC ferromagnetic body is composed 
of domains   a small regions with linear dimensions 102 103 
cm, within  of which  the atoms are  coupled and lined up in the 
same direction that leads to the larger  magnetization, equal to 
saturation value IS.                                                 
      In the absence of external magnetic field vectors of magnetic 
moments of separated domains ( Fig.14.16 ) within ferromagnetic 
 203 
are oriented perfect irregular and magnetic fields cancel one 
another. As a result the resultant magnetic moment of body is 
equal to zero. However, if the body is placed in a magnetic field a 
revolving moment of individual domains appear and they tend to 
align with the external field. If the magnetic field has high 
intensity the ferromagnetic body becomes perfectly magnetized

§15.1. Faradays law of  electromagnetic induction. 
Lenzs rule 
 
    When the magnetic flux through a circuit is varying an electric 
current arrises in the circuit. This phenomenon is called 
electromagnetic induction, and the current   generated thus   is 
referred   to as  induced current. 
     Lenzs rule:  
The direction of 
the induced current 
is always so that 
the magnetic field  
due to current 
opposes the change    Fig.15.1 
in  flux   by  which   
the current is induced. (Fig. 15.1 )                           
    Induced electromotive force ( e.m.f. )  i  in the circuit is equal

           =Bl sin                     ( 15 . 4 )

. This is known as motional emf.        Fig.15.2                      
     Induced e.m.f.  is the energy given    
to electrons when a wire moves  in  a magnetic field. 
    Assume the plane loop, revolving in a magnetic field with the 
angular velocity ,  whose  rotational axis is placed on the plane 
 206 
of loop and is perpendicular to vector B of external field. In this 
case the e.m.f.  is given by 
 
 =BAsint  , 
 
where A-is the area of the loop. 
 
 
§15.3.  Self-induction. Combination of inductors 
 
 Appearance of induced  e.m.f.  as a result of change of the 
current in the circuit. is called self  induction. The change of 
current causes a change in its specific magnetic field. The specific 
magnetic field of current 
produces the magnetic flux 
s across  the surface area, 
limited by this loop. As is 
shown in Fig.15.3 a flux 
will be generated by the 
current and will be directed 
towards the left along the 
coil. By Faraday s law an 
e.m.f. will be induced in the 
coil and it will tend to  
produce flux to the right 
hand side along the coil. 
Hence an induced emf must           Fig.15.3                          
be  opposite  to  the  emf  of  
the battery. If the switch is suddenly opened, the induced emf will 
be added, rather than opposing the battery. In this case the 
magnetic flux is proportional to the current I:  
 
s=LI ,                           ( 15 . 5 ) 
 
 207 
 where a constant of proportionality L  is  called the self 
inductance of the coil.  Inductance L depends on the dimensions 
and geometry   of the coil as well as relative permeability of the 
medium. 
 For the average  selfinduced e.m.f. we  can write:

  is the rate of change of  current through the coil.  
     The SI unit of  inductance is the henry (Hn). 
     A henry is defined as the inductance of a conductor in which a 
change of current of 1 ampere per second induces an e.m.f of 1 
volt.

where N  is the number of  turns, Ais the cross  sectional area 
of solenoid,  l  the length of  solenoid. 
     The  equivalent  inductance of circuits connected in series is 
equal to the sum of individual inductances.  
 
L= L 1 + L 2 + L 3 + ... + Ln                 ( 15. 8 ) 
 
     The reciprocal of equivalent  inductance of  circuits  in parallel 
is the sum of reciprocals of individual inductances.

§15.4. The Mutual induction 
 
    Suppose that we have two coils placed side by side as shown 
in Fig.15.4 When the switch S  is open, both  coils have zero flux 
through them. We call the coil in the battery circuit the primary 
coil and other the secondary coil. If the switch is suddenly closed, 
a magnetic field is set up due to building up of current in the coil 
and magnetic flux is produced 
in its vicinity. Some portion of 
the flux will pass through the 
secondary coil. Thus the flux 
through the secondary coil 
will change when S is 
suddenly closed. According to 
Faradays law an induced emf 
will be produced in  secondary 
for an instant as the current 
rises from zero to its maximum  Fig.15.4  
value  in the primary. It can be  
shown that the direction of the current in primary circuit in 
Fig.15.4. will be from B to A when S is just closed. The current 
will flow in the opposite direction when the switch is opened. 
Since, the change of flux through the secondary will be 
proportional to the change of current in the primary, the induced 
emf in the secondary will be proportional to the rate of change of 
current in the primary

The proportionality constant M depends on the geometry of the 
two coils. It is called the mutual inductance of  two coils.

§15.5. Transformers 
 
        A simple transformer consists of two coils of insulated wire 
wound on the same iron core. When alternating current voltage is 
applied to the input coil, or primary coil, the alternating current 
gives rise to an alternating magnetic flux that is concentrated in 
the iron core. The changing flux passes through the output coil, or 
secondary coil, inducing an alternating voltage and current in it. 
       The induced secondary 
voltage differs from the 
primary voltage depending on                          
the ratio of the numbers of 
turns in the two coils. By 
Faraday’s law the secondary 
voltage is given by 
  Fig.15.5

If the transformer is assumed to be 100% efficient the power input  
Is equal to the power output and since P=IV

   The opposite situation, where the secondary coil has fewer turns

CHAPTER 16 
 
Electric oscillations and 
waves 
 
 
§16.1.  Free electric oscillations.  
Thomsons formula 
 
The  electric circuit consisted  of  capacitor  C inductor  L and 
resistor R in series  is called the oscillation circuit. (Fig. 16.1 ) 
In  oscillating circuit can occur the periodical variation of 
charge  q,  potential difference V  in capacitor and electric current 
I in inductance coil.. If at the 
initial  moment of time ( t = 0 ) 
the switch P (Fig.16.2) is at the 
position a), the capacitor is 
charged receiving the charge q0. 
The energy W= Cq 2/20  is given 
to the capacitor and difference in 
potentials between the plates of 
capacitor becomes equal the    Fig.16.1 
maximum value V0 . At this                            
moment  the current in the circuit is equal to zero. The discharge 
of capacitor begins when the switch is turned to the position b. 
 213 
The current  increases slowly due to self induction and reaches its 
maximum value I = I 0 at moment t = T/4 when q and V  
changing its direction and becomes equal to zero at  t = T/2  Then 
the charge of capacitor and the potential difference between its 
plates again reach  maximum values, but signs of plates  charges 
and direction of electric field are opposed to those, that were at the 
moment t=0  Finally, the capacitor is recharged from  T/2  up to  
(3/4)T and from   (3/4)T  up to  T . Then  processes occur in 
reverse direction. 
         If the oscillatory circuit is considered to be ideal ( in which 
the energy losses can be neglected) energy of electric field is 
totally converted to the magnetic field and inverse  during 
oscillations. One can accept equality of these energies:

                                  (16.1) 
 
Dependence of  𝐼𝑚  versus 𝑈𝑚  in a capacitor is given by  
 
𝐼𝑚 = 𝑈𝑚𝜔𝐶                               (16.2) 
 
Having put this expression into the  (16.1  ) for cyclic frequency 
of free oscillations gives 
 =
1
LC
   .                                  (16.3 ) 
 
Hence for the period of oscillations we get 
 
T = 2  LC      .                            (16.4 ) 
 
This equation is known as Thomsons formula.

The free electric oscillations in real (R 0) circuit  are 
damping. For example, the change of charge q in capacitor  plates 
is described by the law 
 
q = q0 e 
 t sin(  damp.t +  0 )     
 
where   q0  the amplitude value of charge at moment t=0,  
=R/2L  is the damping factor , R   resistance, L   inductance,  
 0    phase constant  of oscillations. 
The quantity damped  is called the cyclic frequency of the 
electric oscillations.:

Damping of oscillation is estimated by the quantity so called 
decrement of damping. It indicates the portion of energy loss 
during    a half of period of oscillations.  
A quantity of energy lost during half period is

§16.2.  Forced electric oscillations 
 
Forced oscillations are called nondamping oscillations of the 
charge, potential differences and current  due to periodically 
changing e.m.f. in oscillating circuit 
 
 =  0 sint                                   (16.11 ) 
 
where   0  is the amplitude value of e.m.f.,  - the cyclic 
frequency of alternating e.m.f. 
Sinusoidally e.m.f. appears in the loop, which rotates 
(revolves) with angular velocity    in a stationary uniform 
magnetic field of induction B  
The magnitude  of magnetic flux is determined by the formula 
(14.4 ). The harmonically  changing magnetic flux leads to e.m.f. 
of induction . 
 
 
§16.3. Alternating current. Active, inductive and 
capacitive resistances.  Total reactance 
 
The current changing according to the harmonic ( sine ) law is 
known as  alternating current. The frequency of alternating 
current is equal to the frequency of imposed e.m.f. 
The effective value of an alternating current is defined as the 
direct current which would develop the same power in an active 
resistance as the given alternating current. 
 216 
 Effective values of an alternating 
current and voltage are  given by

where I m and U m are the amplitude 
values of  the current and voltage  
respectively. 
The total resistance in a circuit of 
alternating current is equal to the 
vector sum of active and reactive 
resistances. 
Active resistance. In the circuit 
with active (R) resistance (Fig.16.2a) 
the harmonic oscillations of current 
occur with the frequency and phase of 
imposed e.m.f. 
 
I = I 0 sin t   ,                    ( 16.13 )                   
       
where I O =  0 / R  the amplitude value 
of current. The graphs of both  
alternating e.m.f. and current and are 
shown in Fig.16.2b. Fig.16.2c  demonstrates the vector diagrams.  
Inductive resistance.  An alternating current in an inductor 
lags behind the voltage by 90 (Fig..16.3 a-c) Relationship 
between amplitude values of imposed e.m.f. and current is as  
 
0 = I X L   ,                       ( 16.14 ) 
 
 217 
where  X L  is the inductive reactance 
and equal to

Resonance.  
The two types of resonance one can distinguished in a circuit 
of alternating current. 
 220 
1. Resonance in series  circuit. When capacitor and inductor 
are  connected in series X L= X C and the impedance is a minimum 
and the current has its maximum value. The voltages in capacitor 
and inductance coil exceed for several times the voltage applied to 
source of e.m.f. Ratios  of voltages in L and C to the  e.m.f.  of 
generator is equal to quality Q. Thus upon the resonance in a 
series circuit voltage in each reactance exceeds e.m.f. applied to 
the circuit  as Q times. Therefore resonance in series circuit refers 
to resonance of voltages. 
2.  Resonance in  parallel  circuit. In this case both junctions 
of circuit possess same voltage. Total current coming from 
generator is divided into two currents as 𝐼𝐿  and  𝐼𝐶 . The current 
in inductive junction lags the voltage by  a definite angle given by 
 
𝑐𝑜𝑠𝜑𝐿 =
𝑅
√𝑅2+(𝜔𝐿)2
                     (16.23) 
 
Resonance resistance of the circuit in parallel is the function of 
quality of circuit: 
 
𝑅𝑟𝑒𝑠 = 𝜌𝑄 = 𝑅𝑄
2                    (16.24) 
 
Thus upon resonance current in each of reactance exceeds the 
current coming  from generator ( minimum current )  as Q times. 
Therefore resonance in parallel circuit is the resonance of 
currents.. 
 
 
§16.5.  Power of alternating current 
 
Instantaneous power of alternating current is determined by 
the production of instantaneous values of current and e.m.f. 
 
P=I = P 0 sin 2 t  ,                       ( 16. 25 ) 
 
 221 
where P 0 = I 0
2 R  is the amplitude value of power. 
Average power.  Average power is defined with the work 
done by alternating circuit during  time interval equal to  the 
period T :

in the circuit is  
P= U eff. I eff. cos  .                         ( 16.27 ) 
 
The factor  cos    is called the power factor. 
 
 
§16.6.   Production of electromagnetic  waves 
 
A transmitting antenna is a good example of a system 
generating electromagnetic  waves through an oscillating charge. 
An antenna is a long loop of wire charged by an alternating source 
of potential, say, of frequency f and period T. 
As the charging potential varies, so does the charge on antenna. 
The dimensions of the antenna are adjusted for this purpose. If the 
charge on the  top of the antenna is + q at any time, the charge at 
this point will be  q after time T/2. This reversal of charges 
occurs due to accelerated motion of charges which creates electric 
flux changing with frequency .. The changing electric flux gives 
rise to electromagnetic waves that propagate away from the 
antenna. The frequencies of such electromagnetic waves are equal 
to the frequencies of the sources generating them. The oscillating 
magnetic field produced by changing electric field is at right angle 
to it. The direction of propagation of the waves is perpendicular to 
the electric  and magnetic fields . If  a such  wave is intercepted by 
 222 
a conducting wire, the oscillating electric field will develop an 
oscillating voltage in it . 
The  frequency of the voltage so developed will be equal to the 
frequency of the wave. There can be many transmitting stations 
producing electromagnetic waves of different frequencies 
simultaneously. We can make arrangements to receive one of 
these stations by connecting inductance L and a variable capacitor 
of capacitance C in parallel . We adjust the value of C such that 
the natural frequency  
1
2   L C
 of this LC circuit is equal to the 
frequency of the incoming electromagnetic wave. At this stage, 
resonance is said to be achieved between the frequency of the 
approaching wave and the LC circuit. The response to a particular 
frequency given by  
1
2   L C
  is maximum at resonance. By 
changing the value of C, we can get resonance with other 
frequencies and receive electromagnetic waves from other 
transmitting antenna. 
Maxwell had proved that radiation of energy in space occurs in 
the form of electromagnetic waves. He showed that the velocity of 
these waves is given by  
1
    0 0
 in space.  
 
§16.7.  The transmission of information and its 
reception 
 
The electromagnetic waves emitted by the LC circuit of aerial 
of a transmitting station are of constant amplitude . These waves 
have frequency of the range of 10 6 Hz, traveling with the velocity 
of light i.e., 3 x 10 8 m s 1 . Sound waves travel with a speed 330 
m s 1 . The sound waves are superimposed on electromagnetic 
waves called carrier waves of an aerial. The sound waves are 
converted into electrical oscillations. This is done by a 
microphone. The amplitude of the electro magnetic waves begin 
 223 
to fluctuate with the frequency of the sound waves.  The louder 
the sound wave, the greater the fluctuation in the amplitude of the 
electro magnetic wave which is called modulated wave. 
 The modulated electromagnetic waves falling on an aerial, 
induce a current of frequency equal to the frequency of the 
electromagnetic wave. If this current is passed through a 
headphone, the diaphragm of the headphone will not vibrate with 
this high frequency. Even if it does, normal human ear will not 
respond to it because only the frequency of the range 20  to 
20x103 Hz is audible. In order that these frequencies can be 
audible, the electromagnetic waves are rectified. The current now 
fluctuates but it flows in one direction. 
A crystal diode is used for rectification of the electromagnetic 
waves. The electromagnetic waves are received by an aerial of 
inductance L1  coupled to an another tuning circuit containing 
inductance L2  and a variable capacitor C2 . The capacitance  C2  is 
varied so that the frequency of the tuning circuit L2C2 is equal to 
the frequency of the incoming electromagnetic waves. The 
amplitude of this current varies with the frequency of the sound 
wave. Thus the original sound is reproduced and heard.

Reflection and refraction of 
light 
 
 
§17.1. Photometrical quantities 
 
Luminous intensity.  The luminous intensity I of a light 
source is measured by comparing it with the international unit, the 
candela. At present, the standard source of luminous intensity is 
one sixtieth of a square centimeter of fused thoria. At the 
temperature of freezing platinum, thoria is incandescent and emits 
a steady flow of light energy. One candela is defined to be the 
luminous intensity of this source. 
     If the two sources of light produce the same illuminance at the 
same surfaces then the luminous intensity is determined by a 
comparison:

where r1 and r2 are the distances  between point of interest and   
light sources. 
                            
 Luminous flux.   The flow of light energy from a source is 
called the luminous flux: the unit of luminous flux is called the 
lumen. One lumen is equal to the luminous flux contained in a 
solid angle of one steradian, when the luminous intensity is one 
candela: 
 
=I    ,                               ( 17. 3 ) 
 
where   - is the solid angle, which is determined as a ratio of 
surface area of a sphere to the square of radius. 
 
2r
A 
                                   ( 17. 4 ) 
 
   Since the sphere of one meter radius has a total surface area of 
4 (1m)2   or  4m2, the solid angle will be equal to 4 for 
isotropic point source. 
 
=4I. 
 
    Illuminance.  Illuminance is the rate at which light energy falls 
on a unit area some distance from a light source (Fig. 34). It is 
determined by the formulas

where  A  is the surface area receiving the luminous flux. 
     Thus, illuminance  is varyed directly with the source 
intensity and varies inversely with the square of distance away 
from the source. The  SI unit of illuminance is the  lux.

Luminous emittance is expressed by the formula

where  -is the luminous flux emitted out in all directions by 
surface element of the source. The unit of measurement of 
luminous emittance is  the lux. 
   Brightness.  To characterize the light irradiation in the fixed 
direction   the brightness  is usually used.  Brightness is defined as  
 
Acos    
 


B    ,                      ( 17.7 ) 
 
where  - is the angle between axis of solid angle and the normal, 
drown to the surface A. 
     SI unit of  brightness  is  
2/ mcd  
 For lambert sources (for which B=const. and same in all 
directions) relation between luminous emissivity and brightness 
has form: 
R   B . 
 
Geometrical optics deals with the rectilinear propagation of 
light. 
 
§17.2. Rectilinear propagation of light. 
The speed of light 
 
      In homogeneous medium light travels in straight lines and 
does not bend around objects. 
The  appearance of a shadow is explained by the rectilinear 
nature of light propagation in the homogeneous medium. From a 
single point source of light arises the whole shadow (Fig.17.1a).  
Two and more sources of light give the whole shadow  and 
semi-shadow (Fig.17.1b).  
 225 
    Among significant methods for the measurement of speed of 
light may be mentioned the following: 
a)  Roemers method, which rested on the observation of the 
time between eclipses of Jupiters moons. 
b)  Bradleys aberration method, which depends on the 
apparent change in position of  fixed starts as the earth makes its 
circuit around the sun. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Fig.17.1 
 
c) The method of Fizeau and Foucault in which an interrupted 
light beam was made to travel several miles, to and from a mirror 
placed at the greatest feasible distance. 
d) Michelsons method amounted to an improvement of 
Foucaults method. 
   Numerous measurements made afterwards by various methods 
indicated that the speed of light in vacuum is the universial 
constant and is not dependent on the frequency and equals to 
c=3x108m/sec. 
 
§17.3.   Laws  of  Reflection and Refraction 
of light 
 
     A   light ray  is  the  direction  along   which   light propagates. 
Incident angle.  Angle i , formed by the incident ray and the 
perpendicular to surface drown from point of incidence O  is 
called the incident angle. (Fig. 17.2.a). 
 
 226 
Reflection angle. Angle r  formed by the same perpendicular 
and the reflected ray is called the reflection angle. 
The reflection of light 
obeys the following laws: 
1.The incident and 
reflected rays lie in the 
same plane as the 
perpendicular to the 
reflecting surface at the  
point of incidence.                                   Fig.17.2 
2.The angle of reflection 
is equal to the angle of incidence. 
Reflection may be mirrored (regular, Fig. 17. 2.a) and diffused 
(irregular, Fig.17. 2.b ). 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
                                               
Fig.17.3 
 
Refraction occurs because of dependence the speed of light  on 
the medium in which the light is traveling. The relation between 
the speed of light in a medium     and the index of refraction n is 
/cn  ,  i.e. the index of refraction of a medium is the ratio of 
the speed of light in a vacuum to the speed of light in the medium.  
   Optical density is the property of a medium, that determines the 
speed of light in that medium. If a medium is optically dense,  it 
slows light more than a medium which is less optically dense. 
 227 
    At the  borderline of  two  media  of different optical densities  
light ray changes its direction when it passes from  one the 
medium into another  
    When the ray of light passes into the medium with greater 
optical density the angle of refraction is smaller than the angle of 
incidence; (Fig.17.3a) when the ray of light passes from an 
optically denser medium into a rarer medium, the angle of 
refraction is greater than the angle of incidence (Fig.17.3b) 
Law of refraction of light. 
Snells law states that the ratio of the sine of the incident angle to 
the sine of the refracted angle is constant:

§17.4.Total  internal reflection. Critical angle 
 
Total internal ref-
lection occurs when a 
ray of light passes from 
a medium   with greater 
optical density into me-
dium  with a less optical 
density. By other words, 
in the medium in which   
light falls from, a speed 
is lower than in the      Fig.17.4 
adjacent medium or the  
angle of refraction is larger than the angle of incidence.                       
The fact that the angle of refraction must be larger than the 
angle of incidence leads to an interesting phenomenon known as a 
total internal reflection. 
The angle of incidence    for which the angle of refraction  
from any medium into air is 90 is called the critical angle for the 
 228 
medium. If   cr total internal reflection occurs and no light 
rays are transmitted into second  medium. From the law of 
refraction a critical angle is 
determined as  
 
sincr.=

shows an performance of total internal reflection. Ray 1 is 
refracted. Ray 2 is refracted along the boundary of the medium 
showing the critical angle. An angle of refraction grater than the 
critical angle results in the total internal reflection of ray 3. 
 
 
§17.5. Plane Parallel Plate. Prism 
 
 When a light passes through the plane parallel plate (Fig.17.5) 
a refraction occurs at two parallel (upper and lower) surfaces. 
Therefore light ray after passing the plate does not change its 
direction, but displaces parallel to 
itself. The displacement  X of the 
ray  is  expressed   by   the   formula

 229 
When light ray falls to the surface of prism (Fig.17.6) the 
double refraction occurs. 
Total deviation  from initial direction depends on the angle of 
incidence , angle of refraction    on the second

CHAPTER  18 
 
Mirrors and lenses 
 
 
§18.1. Formation of an image by plane  mirror 
 
 
A plane mirror reflects 
light rays in the same order 
that they approach it. The 
image is  of the same size as 
an object and is the same 
distance behind the mirror as 
the object is in front of it. 
The image is also erect but 
reversed right for left (18.1)                                                           
                                                                  Fig.18.1 
 
§18. 2.  Concave  mirror 
      
The principal axis is an imaginary line extending from the 
geometric center  of a spherical mirror to its centre of curvature . 
A concave mirror is a converging mirror. The focal point F of 
a converging mirror is the point where parallel rays of light meet 
after being reflected from the mirror.( Fig.18.2)The distance from 
the vertex to the focal point of a spherical mirror is called the 
focal length (F)  The  is related to the radius of curvature ( R) by 
this simple equation: F=R/2  
 231 
It is important to remember two rules concerning concave 
mirrors: 
1. Any light ray, approaching the mirror parallel to the 
principal axis is reflected through the focal point. 
2. Any ray that approaches the mirror through the focal points 
is reflected parallel to the principal 
axis. 
Let us consider some cases of 
formation of image from a converging 
mirror. In Fig.18.2  different locations 
of image are shown: 
a) An object is placed at a distance 
greater than 2F. The image location is 
between F and 2F, inverted, real and 
smaller  than object        
b) Object is at 2F. Image is at 2F, 
inverted, real and the same size as the 
object.  
c) Object is between F and 2F. 
Image is beyond 2F, inverted, real and        Fig.18.2  
larger than the object.  
d) Object is between F and mirror.    
Image is behind mirror, erect, virtual and larger than the object. 
§18.3. Convex mirror 
 
 It is a spherical mirror which is reflective on its outer surface. 
Convex mirrors never form real 
images. The focal length F of a 
convex mirror is negative.Fig.18.3  
shows that an object can be 
anywhere image is                     
behind mirror, erect, virtual and  
smaller than the object.

where 𝑑𝑜 is the object distance, 𝑑𝑖 refers to image distance and F

The ratio of image size (H) to the object size (h) is called the 
lateral magnification: 𝛾=H/h  that is can be expressed in terms of 
image and object distances : 𝛾 = −

𝑑𝑜
 
Sign conventions for spherical mirrors:  
∎ The focal length F (or R) is positive for  a concave mirror and 
negative for a convex mirror. 
∎ The object distance 𝑑𝑜 is always taken to be positive. 
∎The image distance 𝑑𝑖 is positive for a real image(formed on the 
same side of the mirror as the object) and negative for a virtual 
image (formed behind the mirror). 
∎The magnification 𝛾  is positive for an upright image and 
negative for an inverted image. 
 
 
§18.4.  Lenses 
     
A lens is a transparent curved piece of polished or moulded 
material, usually glass 
restricted on two sides by 
curved surfaces. 
    The following shapes of 
lenses are known (Fig.18.4) 
For converging lenses: a) 
double-convex; b) plano-
convex; c)concave-convex. 
For diverging lenses: e) double-concave;  
d) plano-concave;  
g) convex-concave.                                     
 233 
    A straight line passing through the centers of  surfaces of two 
lenses is            Fig.18.4 
called the principal optical   axis. 
The focal point  of a lens is the point where rays that approach 
the lens parallel to the principal axis meet after being refracted by 
the lens. 
   The distance from the lens to its focal point ( focus ) is called   
focal distance or  focal  length. 
     The lens is called converging if its focus distance F  0, and 
diverging if focus distance F 0. 
     The focal point of diverging lens is called the virtual focus.    ( 
Fig.18.6   ) 
The focal length of a lens depends on its shape and its index  of  
refraction. 
     In general, the focal length of a thin lens in air is given by the 
so called lens maker's equation

this equation  the radius of curvature is positive (+R) when center 
of curvature is on side of lens from which light emerges,  is 
negative (-R) when center of curvature is on side of lens on which 
light is incident and becomes infinite ( ∞𝑹 )  for a plane (flat) 
surface. The focal length is positive (+F) for converging lens and 
negative (-F) for diverging lens.

The quantity D =1/F   is called the optical power of lens. D0 for 
convex and D 0  for concave lenses. The unit of measurement of  
D  is diopter (m-1)  
Optical power for a system of two lenses is determined by the 
formulas  
 
D=LD1 D2   and   D=D1 + D2  dD1 D2 ,     ( 18 .3. ) 
 
where L-is the distance between the rear focus of the first lens and 
the front focus of the second lens, d-the distance between lenses, 
D1  and D2  the optical powers of the  first and second lenses 
respectively.

§18.6.  Constructing the image of 
an object  
by the lenses 
 
   Usually for the construction the image 
two from three rays are used: 
1.) Ray, which passes from center of 
the lens without refraction; 
 2) Ray, which propagates parallel to 
the principal axis; this ray after 
refracting by the lens passes from 
second focus. 
 3) Ray (or its continue) which passes 
from first focus and after refracting by 
the lens goes parallel to the principal 
axis.

1.  If a  real object is placed in any position its image will be 
virtual, erect,   Fig.18.5 
diminished and placed inside the focus (Fig.18.6) 
 2.  In case of virtual object placed outside the focus the image is 
virtual, inverted and outside the focus. 
  3.   The image will be real, erect, magnified and farther from the 
lens than the object if object is real and placed inside the focus. 
 
§18.7. Lens aberrations (defects) 
 
Chromatic aberration. 
A lens may be regarded as made up of prisms. It is evident that 
when a ray of white light passes through it, it will be dispersed 
into its constitue  colors. All the red rays are brought to focus at Fr 
whereas all the blue rays are brought to focus at Fb  as shown in 
Fig.18.7a. A complete image will consist of all the colored of the 
spectrum. It is the inability of the lens to focus all the dispersed 
colors at one point. Therefore  the image will be colored and not 
well defined. This defect     Fig.18.6 
of the lens is called chromatic aberration. 
 237 
This defect in the lens can be 
removed by using a combination of 
a convex lens and a concave lens 
made of two different materials 
having unequal dispersive powers. 
These lenses are given such 
suitable shapes that the dispersion 
produced by one lens is exactly 
equal and opposite  to that 
produced by the other. The focal lengths of the lenses are, of 
course, unequal in numerical values; so that the focal length of   
the combination has a finite value. Such a combination is called 
an  achromatic omination of lenses and is shown in Fig.18.7a 
Spherical aberration. 
 A beam of parallel rays is focused 
at point by a lens only if the 
aperture of the lens is small, 
otherwise the lens will refract outer 
rays  slightly  more  than  the  inner 
     Fig.18.7 
rays Fig.18.7b. The image 
produced  
will not be well defined and sharp. 
This defect in a lens is called 
spherical aberration. To refuse this 
defect, optical instruments using 
lenses are provided with a stop which allows only the central rays 
to pass through the lens. In this way, the effective aperture of the 
lens remains small and so the spherical aberration is almost 
removed.                      
The spherical aberration can also be reduced by taking 
suitable values of the radii of curvature of the surfaces of a lens of 
by using two lenses kept at a suitable distance apart. Now we shall 
discuss how the lenses are used in optical instruments.

§18.8. Angle of 
vision. 
Magnification  
of  simple magnifier 
 
Angle of vision is the 
angle, under which the 
object is seen. Fig.18.8 
shows that tg0= 0/ lh , where h-size of object, l0-the objects 
distance. 
Magnification is determined as  Г=tg/ tg0 ,  where  - is the 
angle of  vision in presence of device and 0 -the angle in absence 
of device. (Fig.18.8 ) 
 Few eyes can see clearly an object whose distance is less than 
25 cm, because of the insufficient angle of vision under  which 
they are seen. To make angle greater various optical devices are 
used. Fig.18.8 shows one such device called a magnifying glass. 
In order to observe the magnified image, which can be obtained 
by means of  a converging lens, the object should be placed some 
where between the lens and its focus so that its image be at a 
distance of the best vision from the eye. Magnification is 
determined as  
Г=

where s-is the distance of best vision for normal eye  equals to 25 
cm., and f-is the focal distance of magnifier. 
 
§18.9.  Microscope 
Larger magnifications  are obtained by use the  microscopes. 
The optical system of a microscope consists of the objective 
 239 
(facing an object) and the eyepiece (facing the eye). The path of 
the rays in a microscope is shown in       Fig.18.9 
Fig.18.9.The distance   
between  the rear focus of the objective and the front focus of the 
eyepiece is known as the optical length of the microscope tube. 
Calculations show that the magnification of a microscope is equal 
to the product of  magnifications of the objective and  eyepiece.

observations of objects located at a great distances. 
Telescope consists of two convex lenses: objective and eyepiece. 
The object is at a great distance from the objective. The 
intermediate  image appears between the objective and eyepiece. 
The image distance from eyepiece is less than  the focus of latter. 
The image becomes virtual, magnified and inverted. The 
magnification of telescope is calculated by the equation

respectively. 
     The telescope length   l  is equal to     l = f1  + f2 .

§18.11.  The eye and vision 
 
Fig.18.10 shows schematically how an image is obtained on 
the eye retina. The closer is the object to the eye, the bigger is its 
image on the retina and the greater is the angle  at which the 
object is viewed (Look at Fig.18.10). This is the so-called visual 
angle. When the object is moved away from the eye, the visual 
angle at which the object 
is viewed will diminish 
and the object will appear 
smaller.   
     
     If the visual angle    is 
small  
our eye will see two points 
situated side by side as 
one.                                                              Fig.18.10 
      The distance which is the most convenient for observation  an 
object is called the distance of the best vision  s  and equals to 25 
cm. 
Defects of eyesight: a) Near-sighted eye, b) Far-sighted eye. 
To correct near-sightedness eyeglasses with concave lenses are 
worn.(Fig.18.10) 
To correct far-sightedness eyeglasses with convex lenses are 
used.(Fig.18.10)

Physical optics 
 
§19.1.  Interference  of  light.   
Huyghens principle 
 
An interference pattern is set up when light falls on two narrow 
slits that are close together. In Fig.19 are shown two waves of 
wavelength  traveling from slits, between which distance is d. In 
front of slits waves propagate in all directions, however, here are 
given waves under three 
different angles, In a) waves 
pass the same ways from 
slits and reach screen in the 
same phase. In this case the 
enhancement occurs and a 
bright spot appears at the 
centre of the pattern. b) 
Constructive interference 
appears then, when optical 
path difference equals to 
one wave length  (or any 
whole number of wavelength)   Fig.19.1  
as is shown in Fig.19b Note,  
that in general case the optical path is equal to ns, where n-the 
refracting index and s -is the geometrical  path. It can be seen that 
 241 
for constructive interference the optical path-difference =dsin  
is determined as 
 
                                  dsin = 2m

difference  dsin  is equal to

If the phase difference  2 - 1  is constant, then oscillations are 
called-coherent. Then the resultant intensity is expressed by  
 
                      I=I1+I2+2 I I1 2 cos (2-1)   .              (19. 5)                                        
                                                                                
Resultant intensity I will be exceed  I1+I2 at the points , for 
which cos(2-1) 0, and will be less than I1+I2 when cos(2-
1)0. 
Dependence   of  intensity at  any  point of  screen  on  the  
phase  shift      =2-1  is given by

where I0-is the intensity at the center of pattern. An interference 
pattern can be used to measure the wavelength of light waves. 
Fig.19.2 gives schematic diagram for analysis the double-slit 
interference (Youngs double-slit experiment). Consider a point P 
on the screen. The path diffe-
rence between the two rays 
arriving at P is  
 
    S2P S1P =S2 Q=dsin, 
 
thus for P to be a bright fringe,   Fig.19.2 
the path difference  should be  
an integral multiple of the wavelength  as explained above; that is 
 
 dsin = m ,                              (19.7) 
 
where m=0,1,2,... for bright fringe. At point O, S2P S1P =0. the 
path difference is zero; there will be a bright at O corresponding 
to m=0, and is called zeroth - order fringe or zero order fringe. 
According to Fig. 20 a calculation y the position of point P from 
the central point O gives 
        y m

By knowing d and D, measuring y and counting the number of 
fringes m from O, we can calculate the wave length. Distance 
between the centers of two consecutive bright fringes or dark 
fringes is called width or fringe spacing. In order to obtain it we 
first find the position of the m-th  dark or bright fringe and 
 243 
subtract from it the position of the (m1)- th dark or bright fringe. 
This will the fringe width: 
ym=(D/d)      .                       (19. 9) 
 
 Huyghens Principle. Huygens’ principle states: Every point 
on a wave front may be considered as a source that produces 
secondary wavelets. The wavelets propagate in the forward 
direction with a speed equal to the speed of the wave motion. Let 
us consider a wave front A produced by a source of light S 
(Fig.19.3). Consider the dots on this wave front as secondary 
sources, each producing a spherical wave. This is done by 
drawing hemisphere of radii ct, where c is the speed of light and 
t is the time during which the wave propagates from one wave 
front to the other. If we join the points on these spherical surfaces 
which are in phase, the result is a new wave front B. Similarly we 
can construct a wave front C 
from wave front B. The process 
can be repeated. There are an 
infinite number of wave fronts 
but we have just shown three of 
them. 
 Dutch philosopher Huyghens 
in his attempt to fit a wave theory 
to  the  known  facts   of   straight        Fig.19.3 
line propagation, reflection and  
refraction proposed to consider that every point of any wave front 
W1 acts as a center from which elementary spherical waves spread 
out front W2 is continually formed along the line that touches all 
of the secondary wave fronts.( Fig. 19.3 ) 
 
 
§19.2.  Interference in thin films 
 
Light reflected from a thin films shows interference. There are 
two important cases. In first case the two surfaces of the thin film 
 244 
are parallel and the incident light is inclined to the surfaces. A part 
of falling light reflects at point A from upper surface, other  part 
passes into film and reflects at point D from its lower surface   
(Fig.19.4) Light reflected from the lower surface passes additional 
distance ADC. If the distance ADC equals to wavelength or 
integral number wavelength, then both of waves(they are 
coherent, since appears in the 
same point of source) show 
interference  enhancing one 
another: =m ,where 
m=0,1,2,... etc. If the way ADC 
equals to 
1
2
 , 
3
2
 , 
5
3
  and etc. 
waves appear in opposite phases      Fig.19.4 
and  damping one another. (=(m+
1
2
)), here  =(AD+DC)n - 
BC is the optical path difference. This quantity may be 
expressed as  
 
 
 =2d n2 2 sin     ,                     ( 19. 10 ) 
 
 where d-the thickness of the thin film,  n-the refracting index and  
 -the angle of  incidence. 
Finally, for interference maximum of reflected ray 
 
2d n2 2 sin  = (2m+1)( )2/   ,         (19.11) 
 
and for interference minimum of reflected ray we get 
 
2d n
2 2 sin  =2 m(/2)    .                  (19.12) 
 
 245 
Note, that relations (2.11) and (2.12) are conditions for 
minimum and maximum of passed ray respectively. 
The second case is of a wedge-shaped film such as the air film 
between two smooth glass surfaces. In this case the reflected light 
from the upper and lower surfaces of the air film have a path 
difference. When emerging from the top they are superimposed to 
produce interference fringes. The fringes in this case are straight 
lines and parallel to the edge of wedge. The fringe at the point 
where the thickness of film is  zero is a dark fringe even though 
the optical path lengths are the same. It is due to the rule given 
below. 
When a light wave traveling in one medium is reflected from 
the surface of a second medium which has a greater refractive 
index, the reflected ray suffers an additional phase change of 180 
or a path difference of   / 2. No phase   change takes place if the 
second medium has a lower refractive index. The conditions of 
refractive and destructive interference will interchange if there is 
an additional phase difference of 180  . 
 
 
§19. 3.  Newtons  rings 
 
  Newton devised an experiment to find the wavelength of 
light. The interference pattern is formed in plane-convex lens 
placed in contact at the point O with a plane-glass surface. When 
this arrangement is illuminated from above by light a series of 
concentric rings can be observed. These are called Newton’s 
rings. Circular or ring like fringes are formed due to the 
interference between the rays 1 and 2 reflected by the bottom and 
top surfaces of the air gap between the convex lens and the plane 
glass. 
Because this air gap increases in width from the central contact 
point out to the edges, the extra path length for the lower ray 
varies, where it equals 0, 

  

,   ,

 ,  2  and so on, and results 
 246 
in series of bright and dark rings. The 
interference pattern which is formed 
in plane-convex lens, coinciding at 
the point O with the plane parallel 
glass is called Newtons rings. Ray 1 
passes the air gap twice and shows an 
interference with the ray at the point 
C. Interference pattern consists of 
bright and dark circles with radius rN .     Fig.19.5 
(Fig.19.5). Newtons rings                               
allows to calculation the wavelength  by the following relation:

where rN is the radius of the N-th light ring, R-is the curvature 
radius of the lens. 
 
 
§19.4. Diffraction  of light . Single slit  Diffraction 
 
A phenomenon  of bending of light around the edges of an 
obstacle is called diffraction of light. This phenomenon is 
exhibited when light passes through a narrow slit or aperture. 
When light shines on a slit placed in front of a screen the 
interference pattern consisting of the seriesly mutual images of 
source, separated with the distances is observed. All parallel rays ( 
Fig. 19.6 ), falling under angle  to the optical axis meet at the 
point F. For  constructive interference the angles     obey 
condition

The quantity  = CD=bsin is the optical path difference 
between edge rays CN and BM going from slit under the angle . 
In the direction  =0 the zero order most 
intensively central maximum is observed. 
The light amplification always is observed 
at the point F0 independently of the 
wavelength . 
     There is no significant difference 
between an interference and diffraction 
phenomenon. Interference is usually 
referred to as the superposition of only a 
few  no  of very large number of secondary 
waves. 
Fig.19.6 
 
 
§19.5.  Diffraction  grating 
 
 The most interesting case of diffraction can be realized by 
means of a diffraction grating. An array of large number of 
parallel slits all of the same width and spaced equally is said to 
form a diffraction grating. It is formed by drawing very fine 
equidistant parallel lines on the glass plate. The light cannot pass 
through the lines while the spacing between the lines is 
transparent to light. A simple diffraction grating is a plate with 
alternating narrow transparent and oraque parallel strips. The sum 
of the widths of a transparent(reflecting) and oraque (scattering) 
strips d is called the grating period and is given by d=1/ n where 
 248 
n is the number of lines in one unit length of a diffraction grating 
respectively. In the best of modern gratings there are up to 1800 
slits per millimeter  so that the grating period is about 0.8m. 
If the general width of grating is L, the number of slits is N, 
then grating interval d may be computed as 
d
L
N
  
      Let us consider the wave propagating from the grating in a 
direction forming angle   with the normal to the grating plane 
(Fig.25). The path differences for the rays emerging from similar 
points have the same value: =dsin. In order that all beams 
enhance  one another, it is necessary that  dsin  be equal to an 
integral number of wavelength  i.e. 
          
             dsin=n,         n=0;  1; 2; . . .                    ( 19.16 ) 
 
Expression (19.16) is the condition of constructive interference. 
n=0 is the central bright line or central maxima; n=1 is the first 
order maximum; n=2 is the second order maximum and so on.  
The direction with  = 0 ( or n=0 ) is the direction of the initial 
beam. 
     If white light is used in a grating the diffraction produces 
several color lines on either side of the central maximum for each 
n. 
  A grating is used for determination the wave length of light 
by measuring angle  which shows the position of the maximum 
of a given order.  From the measured value of  and from the 
knowledge of the grating interval, the wavelength can be 
determined. From the relation ( 2.14 ) we get

of maximum intensity, y is the distance between grating and 
screen. 
 
 
§19.6. Polarization of light 
 
Consider a beam of ordinary light. It consists of a large number 
of waves, each with its own plane of vibration. All directions of 
vibration are equally probable and are always perpendicular to the 
direction of propagation. Now if we 
could have some such arrangement 
that allows only those vibrations  that 
are parallel to slit to pass through it. 
The  resulting beam is said to be 
polarized. This process of confining 
the beam of light to one plane of 
vibration is called polarization.                            Fig.19.7                                               
  Plane of polarization is called the  
plane in which the vectors E are placed. If the plane of oscillation 
does not change its orientation in the space, then wave is called  
plane ( linearly ) polarized. Light, in which the orientation of 
polarization plane is changed irregularly  is called natural light . 
(Fig.19.7). 
 Plane-polarized light can be obtained by  help of a filter 
(polarizer), such as polaroid sunglasses, is placed in front of the 
beam of light, only those waves that vibrate parallel to the 
permitted plane pass through( Fig.19.8 ) 
Suppose a second sheet of polaroid material(analyzer) is placed 
in the path of the polarized light. If its permitted plane is 
perpendicular to the light that passed through the polarizer, almost 
 250 
no light will pass through. Intensity of the  light passed through 
polarizer  is  determined by the Maluces law: 
 
I=I0cos
2    ,                              ( 19. 19 ) 
 
where -the angle between 
polarizer axis and polarization 
plane of incident wave, I0-the 
intensity of incident wave. 
 Polarization by reflection. A 
natural light can be partially 
polarized by reflection from the 
surface of dielectric . The light  
which is reflected from the glass                          Fig.19.8                     
becames completely polarized  
at the angle of incidence, determined from a relation called 
Brewsters law: 
 
tgB= n    ,                                ( 19 . 20 ) 
 
where angle B  is called the Brewsters or  angle of total 
polarization  , n-the refractive  index.  
    Under perfect polarization by reflection the angle between 
reflected and refracted rays is equal to 
90 .(Look at Fig.19.9) 
 
Polarization by double refraction. When monochromatic light 
travels in glass, its speed is the same in all directions and is 
characterized by a single index of refraction.  Any material like 
this is said to be isotropic, meaning that it has the same 
characteristics in all directions. Some crystalline materials, such 
as quartz, calcite, and ice are anisotropic with respect to the speed 
of light; that is, the speed of light is different in different 
directions within the material. Anisotropizm gives rise to some 
unique optical properties, one of   which is that of different indices 
of refraction in different directions. Such materials are said to be 
 251 
double refracting or to exhibit 
birefringence. For example, a 
beam of unpolarized light incident 
on a double refracting crystal of 
calcite (CaCO3, calcium carbonate) 
is shown in Fig. 19.10. When the 
beam is at an angle to a particular 
crystal axis, it is doubly refracted 
and separated into two components        Fig.19.9 
or  rays.  Also,  the   two   rays   are  
linearly polarized in mutually perpendicular  directions. One ray, 
called the ordinary (o) ray, passes through the crystal in an 
undeflected path and is characterized by an index of refraction  
 on   that is the same in all directions. The second ray, called the 
extraordinary (e) ray, is 
refracted and is characterized 
by an index of refraction  en  
that varies with direction. The 
direction along of which  
eo nn   is called optical  axis.                    
Some double refracting crystals,   Fig.19.10 
such as tourmaline, exhibit the  
interesting property of absorbing one of the polarized components 
more than the other. This property is called dichroism. Double 
refraction is due to features of propagation of electromagnetic 
waves in anisotropic  medium: amplitudes of forced oscillations of 
electrons depend on the directions of these oscillations. 
Propagation of ordinary and extraordinary rays  can visually be 
described by the wave surfaces. Only in the direction of optic axes 
speeds of ordinary and extraordinary rays are the same and equal 
to  00 / nc   ,where n0 –is the index of refraction of ordinary 
ray, and is different for different crystals. For positive crystals 
0 e , but for negative crystals 0 e . Greatest difference 
 252 
between speeds of ordinary and  extraordinary rays  is in the 
directions perpendicular to optic

Double refracting crystals 
are used for preparation the 
polarizing prisms. In order to 
obtain two linearly polarized 
light by double refraction  the 
widely used crystal the  Iceland spar.     Fig.19.11

and    en . At wavelength nm4.589  the refractive indices of 
Iceland spar are  658.1on   and   (Fig.19.11) 
 
 
§19.7. Dispersion of light 
 
  A dependence of light speed (or refracting index) on the 
wavelength(or frequency) in a  media is called a dispersion of 
light. 
 =f()= f 
 
White light is a combination of many colors of light. Each color 
corresponds to a different wavelength. When white light  passes 
through a glass prism, these wavelengths are separated. Waves 
with different wavelengths due to dispersion are propagated in 
various directions: waves with shortest lengths are bended to the 
base side of prism under greater angle in comparison to waves 
with longest lengths. Light spectrum consist of seven colors 
 ( violet, orange, navy blue, dark blue, green, yellow, red ): Red 
and violet lights are at opposite ends of the spectrum .

§19.8. The photoelectric effect 
 
According to the quantum optics light is considered to be the 
stream of particles called - photons, having no mass of rest, and 
moving with velocity c , equal to speed of light in vacuum. The 
main characteristics of photons are

Note, that wavelengths and frequencies of light have the following  
boundaries respectively: 
 
  ( .0 40 -0 75. ) m 
f  = (0.75  0.40) 10 15 Hz 
 
 The  emission of electrons from a metal plate exposed to light 
of certain frequencies is called the 
photoelectric effect (Fig.19.12).  
The electrons ejected from the metal 
plate by the light are called photo-
electrons. Photoelectrons accelerated 
by electric field between electrodes 
create a photocurrent I. Dependence of 
I versus potential difference is shown 
in Fig.19.13.  
Curves in figure correspond to          Fig.19.12 
different illuminations E of cathode.  
At a certain V=Vst. the photocurrent reaches maximum value 
I=Is., which is called saturated photocurrent. At V=Vst. all 
 254 
electrons ejected from a metal plate reach anode: Is.=en., where  
n- is the total number of electrons ejected per unit time.,e-the 
electrons charge. Existence of photocurrent at negative values of 
potential difference is explained so, that  photoelectrons have 
initially kinetic energy 
with, maximum 
2/2maxm  . The work 
done, required for  
stopping  the electrons 
is equal to the maxi-
mum kinetic energy and 
is given by the equation

.maxm =eVSt.    .                         ( 19.24 ) 
 
Here Vst. is the stopping potential. 
 
 
 
§19.9.  Laws of external photo-effect. Einsteins 
equation  
 
1. The maximum initial velocity  max. of photoelectrons 
depends on the light frequency and properties of metals surface. 
2. Total number  n of photoelectrons and power of saturated 
photocurrent is direct proportional to the illumination E of 
cathode. 
3. For each substance there is a red boundary of photo-effect 
(threshold value), which is the minimum frequency  fmin.  of light 
 255 
needed to eject electrons from a plate. Light of frequency ( f  
fmin.  or   max.  does not eject electrons from metal. 
 Suppose that an electron in the metal surface absorbs this 
photon of energy .., before the electron can leave the surface, part 
of the incident energy must be used to overcome the binding 
energy of the electron in metal. This is called the work function. 
Thus in order to eject an electron out of the metal surface a photon 
must have an energy .. called the threshold energy equal to the 
work function of the metal. 
      Energy  of photons  hf  falling on the metal represents the sum 
of the work done to stop the electrons and the work done A to free 
the electrons from the metal surface: 
 
                    hf =
2
2
.maxm  + W .                       ( 19.25 ) 
 
     This expression is known as Einsteins equation. The 
maximum kinetic energy of the emitted electron can be calculated 
from the photoelectric equation: 
  
2
2
.maxm = eVst.=h( f - fmin ).          ( 19.26 ) 
 
In Fig.19.12 the graph shows the kinetic energy of ejected 
electrons  as a function of  frequency of incident light. 
 
 
§19.10. Pressure of light 
 
A pressure which is created by electromagnetic waves, falling 
on the surface of any object is called pressure of light. Existence 
of lights pressure is predicted in electromagnetic theory of light. 
Under action of electric field electrons  move in opposite direction 
of E with velocity  . Magnetic field acts on moving electrons 
 256 
with the  Lorentz’  force  FL. in the sense perpendicular to metal’s 
surface. Thus, light wave exerts a pressure to the metals surface,   
given  as  
 
p = ( 1+ r ) w ,                      ( 19.27 ) 
 
where r-the reflection coefficient of medium, w-the  density of 
energy flux.

CHAPTER 20 
 
Relativistic  mechanics 
 
 
 
§20.1. Inertial frames of reference 
 
In all frames of reference that move with uniform velocity 
with respect   to one another, Newton’s laws are  valid in inertial 
reference frames. Such reference frames are called inertial 
reference frames. All inertial systems of reference are thus 
equivalent. 
It is necessary to distinguish: 
a ) the motion of systems with lower relative speed (   c ) . 
In this case the laws of classical mechanics are true. 
b ) the motion of systems with higher relative speed (   c ) 
. In this case the laws of relativistic mechanics are valid. 
 
 
§20.2. Galilean  transformations 
 
  Galilean transformation of space time coordinates relate the 
motions in an two inertial systems of reference that move with   
small relative velocity. 
     If ( x , y , z , t ) are coordinates of point with respect to the 
unprimed frame of reference in stationary and   ( x , y  , z , t)   
 258 
are coordinates and time with respect to the primed frame of 
reference  
 
x  = x   t  ;   y    = y  ;   z    = z  . 
x = x     + t  ;     t  = t                                ( 20.1 ) 
 
 
§20.3. Velocity transformations 
 
   From the transformation of the space time coordinates we 
can find that  
 
x  =   x  ;   y  =  y;    z =  z;    x = x +  ,   ( 20.2 ) 
 
where  x  is the velocity measured in K frame of reference, and  
x is the velocity measured in K frame of reference . 
 
 
§20.4. Acceleration and force transformations 
 
      An acceleration of an point in an inertial frame  of 
reference we find as the ratio of the difference of velocities to the 
time interval. 
a = 
 2 1
2 1

  , 
 
where  1 and    2  are the velocities in the unprimed frame of 
reference. According  to the  law of  addition  of velocities 
 
1  =  1   ;       2  =  2     , 
 
where 1  and    2  are the velocities measured in the primed 
frame of  reference. Therefore the new acceleration a in the 
primed frame K is  
 259 
 a  =

   .                              ( 20.3 ) 
Having put ( 20.2 ) into ( 20.3 ) we get : 
 
a  = a .                                       (20.4 ) 
 
 Thus the acceleration measured in the moving frame of 
reference is exactly equal to that measured in the stationary frame. 
  Since the mass is independent of velocity and the assumption 
that the laws of physics are the same in the primed as well as in 
the unprimed frame of reference means that  
 
F = F .                               ( 20.5 ) 
 
   Thus in all inertial frames of reference would agree in the 
magnitude and direction of the force F independent of the relative 
velocities of the reference frames. 
 
 
§20.5.  Lorenzs  transformation 
 
  Lorenz s transformation give a relation between the space

§20.6.  Einstein s  postulates of special  theory  
of relativity 
 
A. Einstein proposed a new theory of relativity based upon 
two postulates which are follows : 
1. All   laws of physics are the same in every inertial reference 
frame . 
2. The speed of light in a vacuum, measured in all inertial 
reference frames always has the same value of c , no matter how 
fast the source of light and the observer are moving relative to 
each other. 
Some interesting results of the special theory of relativity can 
be summarized in the following: time dilation, length contraction , 
mass  and moment increasing . 
 
 
§20.7.  Time dilation 
 
If t0 is the instant of time of an event  measured by an 
observer in a moving frame of reference, the time instant t  
appears to a stationary observer with respect to the moving one is 
given as  
 
 261 
                               t = 
t0
2
1  
  .                            ( 20.10 ) 
 
The time interval  of the moving clock as viewed by the non- 
stationary observer is longer than the interval of the clock in the 
stationary frame of reference. Thus, a moving clock runs slower 
than an identical clock that is stationary in his of reference. This is 
called the time dilation. 
 
 
§20.8.  Length contraction 
 
If  l0 is the length of an object in a stationary frame of 
reference, then the length l of the same object as vowed by the 
observer in frame of reference moving with a velocity  relative 
to the object, is given by  
              
                L = L 0 1
2    ,                     ( 20.11) 
 
since    1 , therefore L   L0 . There is a shortening of length. 
This is known as the Lorenz contraction of length. 
In accordance with the equation  ( 20.7 ) we can write a 
relation for a volume of the body as  
 
     V = V0 1
2                      ( 20.12) 
 
where  V0  and V are the volumes  in  a stationary  and moving 
frames  of reference  respectively.  
 
              
 
 
 
 262 
§20.9. Addition of velocities 
 
 
In result of time dilation and the length construction  the 
velocity in an frame of reference that move relatively to the given 
system changes in magnitude as well in direction:

§20.10. Relativity of mass and linear  momentum 
 
If m 0 is the rest mass of an object in a frame of reference, 
then, the mass m as measured by an observer moving with a 
velocity v relative to the object is  
  
 m = 
m 
 
0
2
1  
  .                               ( 20.15) 
 
This equation shows that mass m changes with velocity. The 
mass m here is known as relativistic mass to distinguish it from 
the rest mass since   is less than  1, and the relativistic mass m is 
greater than the rest mass m 0 .  
From relationships  (20.12 ) and ( 20.15 ) it follows that  the 
density of a body varies in accordance with the  following relation 
 
 =

From equation ( 20.11 )  it also follows that  relativistic 
momentum is expressed  as

§20.11. Mass - energy equivalence 
 
The most remarkable achievement of Einstein’s special theory 
of relativity is the revelation of the equivalence of mass and 
energy. The work done on an object  not only increases its kinetic 
energy, but its mass too. Thus , energy converted to mass, and 
mass and energy are equivalent. The total energy of  moving 
object is  mc 2  which is the product of its relativistic  mass  and 
the squared speed of light . The rest energy of an object is m0c
2 or 
the product of its mass at rest and the  squared speed of light . The 
difference between some object’s total energy and its rest one is 
just the kinetic energy of the object. Because c 2  is very larger 
quantity  it can be recognized that even a small amount of mass 
corresponds to a large amount of energy. Thus 
 
The total energy           E t  = m c

The kinetic energy  E k = E t   E r  =  m c

Finally  kinetic energy is given by

has the form

This series of lines were called Balmer series. 
Balmer empirical formula not only fitted the visible lines but 
also predicted several other series of lines in the hydrogen 
spectrum. These lines had not been seen before because they were 
not in the visible part of the spectrum. The series are now known 
as the Lyman, Paschen and Brackett series after the names of their 
discoverers. These are described by the formulae as under

§21.2.  Rutherford and Bohr models of an atom 
 
On the basis of alpha particle scattering experiments, 
Rutherford concluded that the atom consisted of a tiny but 
massive positively charged central part, called the nucleus, 
surrounded by orbiting electrons at some distance away. Now an 
electron in an orbit is an accelerating charge and according to 
electromagnetic theory it should give off energy in the form of 
radiation continuously. An electron moving in a circular orbit as 
proposed by Rutherford, should continuously lose energy, and 
thus spiral inward until it is swallowed up  by the nucleus.  A 
successful theory was proposed by Niels Bohr. One aspect of this 
theory was that Bohr s formula for the allowed frequencies of 
emitted radiation exactly fitted the experimentally observed 
atomic spectrum of hydrogen atom. 
 267 
A model of atom suggested by Bohr is known as a planetary 
model. According to this model electrons orbited the nucleus 
much like planet orbits the sun. Bohr  suggested that an electron 
has a certain energy in each orbit and moves without the emission 
of radiation. These allowed orbits are known as stationary states. 
Bohr suggested also, that electron could radiate the energy, when 
it passes from one state to another one with lower energy. On the 
contrary, when electron passes from any orbit to another with 
greater  value of energy it absorbs a certain energy, equal the 
difference of two levels. Upon each transition only one particle of 
light- photon is radiated, which energy is determined from the 
equation. 
     Generally this model is based upon the following postulates: 
1.  An electron can not revolve in an circular orbit. Only those 
orbits are possible for which the angular momentum of the 
electron about the nucleus is an integral multiple of  
h
2 
 where h 
is Planck s constant. These orbits are called allowed orbits. The 
angular momentum of an electron of mass m, moving with 
velocity n in an orbit of radius rn is given by m nrn. Thus 
according to this postulate, we have 
 
m  n r n  = n 
h
2 
 , n= 1,  2,  3, . . .             ( 21.6 ) 
 
2. The total energy of the electron in one of its allowed orbit 
remains constant as long as it remains in the same orbit. 
3.  An atom radiates energy only when an electron jumps from an 
allowed orbit of  higher energy  𝐸𝑛 to one of lower energy 𝐸𝑝 . 
The difference of energy appears as photon or quanta of energy, ℎ 
, where 𝑓 is the frequency of the photon.

In a circular motion around the nucleus   an electron  is  also 
acted by the centripetal acceleration. Then in agreement with the 
Newton s  second law we can write:

For nearest orbit ( n=1 ) of hydrogen atom ( Z=1) we get 
 
                              r 1  =   0.529 x 10 

§21.4. Energy of electron in an orbit 
 
The orbital energy of electrons in the hydrogen atom can be 
calculated using the Bohr equation. Total energy of electron is 
equal to the sum of kinetic and potential energies. Since the 
electron is negatively charged, its potential energy is also negative 
.

Compare the theoretical equation ( 21.15 ) of the Bohr theory 
with the empirically formulated equation ( 21.1 ) that fits in the 
observed spectrum of hydrogen atom. The form of equation is the 
same. The value of R H in Bohr's  model was also found in 
excellent agreement with the value of the Rydbergs constant 
determined empirically in the Balmer's formula, i. e. RH = 
1.0974x10 7 m 1. 
It is convenient to represent the energy of the quantized states 
of the atoms on an energy level diagram. The energy level 
diagram for hydrogen atom is shown in Fig. 21.1. The energy 
levels of the atom are 
represented as a series of 
horizontal lines and the 
transitions between the levels are 
represented by vertical arrows. 
The transitions from various 
energy levels terminating on the 
lowerest level (n=1) give rise to 
Lyman series.  Balmer series occur for transitions ending at 
second  energy  level  (n=2).  The       Fig.21.1 
Paschen, Brackett and Phund  
series occur for transitions from various energy levels to third 
(n=3), fourth (n=4) and fifth ( n=5 ) energy levels, respectively. 
 271 
Only the Balmer series is  in the visible part of the spectrum. The 
Lyman series is in the ultraviolet and the others are in the infrared 
region. Two of the possible transitions are also shown in the 
Fig.21.1 that result in spectral lines in the hydrogen spectrum.  
The transition from  state with n=3 to the  state with n=2 produce 
a photon of wavelength 656.3 nm, the resulting spectral line 
occurs in the Balmer series. 
Similarly the spectral line 
wavelength 121. 6 nm is given 
off due to transition from n=2 
state to n=1 state. The 
wavelength calculated in this 
way are in excellent agreement 
with those observed 
experimentally in the line spectrum of hydrogen. Bohr   theory 
successfully explains Balmer  formula  and  predicts  
 Fig.21.2 
the wavelength of all observed  
spectral lines in hydrogen spectrum. However, Bohr theory is 
unable to predict or explain energy levels in complex atom, which 
has many electrons. 
 
.   
§21.6. Inner – shell transitions   and  X  rays 
  
     In the heavy atoms, the electrons are assumed to be arranged in 
concentric shells at increasing distance from the nucleus. These 
shells are labeled as K, L, M, N etc. the K shell being closest to 
the nucleus, the L shell next, and so on. The outer shell electrons 
are loosely bound and relatively small amount of energy is 
sufficient to raise them to excited state or even for  ionization. On 
their return to normal states, spectral lines of wavelength in or 
near the visible region are emitted. However, the situation is quite 
different for transitions involving inner shell electrons. They are 
closer to the nucleus and hence more tightly bound. Large amount 
 272 
of energy is required for their displacement from their normal 
energy levels. Consequently, photons of larger energy are emitted 
when the atoms return to their normal states. Thus the transitions 
of inner shell electrons in heavy atoms give rise to the emission of 
high energy photons or   X  rays.   Let K  shell electron is 
removed  from  an  atom  creating a  vacancy in  the K  shell 
(Fig.21.2a) then an electron from either the L, M, or N shell will 
quickly jump down to fill the vacancy in K  shell emitting the 
excess energy as  X  ray photon ( Fig.21.2b).                               
An  X  ray photon  due to transition from L  shell to the 
vacancy in the K shell is 
called K  characteristic  X 
ray . The transitions from 
M and N shells to the K 
shell give rise to K and K   
X rays , respectively. 
Similarly L, M, and N 
series  X rays, relatively 
of lower energy, are 
produced due to the ejection of electrons from L, M and  N 
shells, respectively. 
      A schematic diagram of    Fig.21.3 
a modern X ray  tube is shown  
in Fig.21.3. The  tube is evacuated so that the focused beam of 
electrons from the filament is pulled on to the anode at very high 
speed because of very high potential difference applied between 
the filament and the target. The high potential difference is 
provided by a transformer from a.c. supply. The accelerated 
electrons are suddenly decelerated on impact with the target and 
some of the kinetic energy is converted into electromagnetic 
energy, as   X rays . 
    In case when electrons lose all their K.E. in the first collision, 
the entire K.E. appears as a photon of maximum energy. The other 
 273 
electrons which suffer a no of collision before coming to rest will 
give rise to photons of smaller energy. 
      The X rays  spread out from the target and pass easily 
through the glass tube walls, X rays are only produced on the 
half cycle of a.c. when target is positive with respect to the 
filament. Most of the kinetic energy of the electron goes into 
producing heat. The heat is conducted away from the target by a 
copper rod in which the target material is embedded. The rod is 
cooled by circulating oil / water through it or by the use of cooling 
fins do dissipate the thermal energy.  
    The intensity of  X rays  increases with the number of 
electrons hitting the target and, therefore , depends on the filament 
current. The energy of the   X rays  increases with the operating 
voltage of the tube. 
 
 
§21.7.  The Laser  Principle and its operation 
 
The device can produce a very narrow, intense beam of 
coherent light by stimulated emission. This is a process in which 
de - excitation of an atom is caused by an incident photon with the 
emission of a second photon of the same energy which is coherent 
with  the original photon as shown in 
Fig.21.4.   Suppose an atom jumps 
from its ground state E1 to an excited 
state E 2 and a photon of energy 
exactly equal to the difference of the 
two states (hf=E2E1) is incident on it 
(Fig.21.5a ) When the excited atom is the presence of an 
electromagnetic field that oscillates exactly with the frequency , 
the field will stimulate the atom to di-excite by          Fig.21.4 
emitting a photon in phase with external  
field. The incident photon thus increases the probability that the 
electron will return to the ground state (E1)  by emitting a second 
photon having the same energy and exactly in phase with incident 
 274 
photon (Fig.21.5b) These photons can , in turn, stimulate other 
atoms to emit photons in a chain of similar events as shown in 
Fig. 21.6. 
The operation of laser depends upon the existence of 
metastable state in the 
atoms of some 
substances . The 
metastable states are 
excited atomic states 
that can persist for 
unusually long 
periods of time. For example, the life time of most excited states 
is only about 108  second, but there          Fig.21.5 
exist in some substances                            
such excited states in which the life is about 103  second or even 
more. 
 When light is made incident 
on such a substance usually 
called the active medium, there is 
a net absorption of photons due 
to more atoms in the ground state 
than in the excited state 
(Fig.21.6). It is only if the 
situation can be inverted, that is , there should be more number of 
atoms in the excited state than in   Fig.21.6 
the ground    state, a net emission of   
photons can result. Such a situation is called “population 
inversion“.  
 Let the incident photons of energy  h13 equal to E3  E1  
pump up the  atoms  from  ground  state E1   to excited   state  E3 
(Fig. 21.7)   but the excited atoms do not decay back directly to 
state E1. Instead , they decay spontaneously emitting photon of 
energy hf23  to the lower energy state E2 which is a metastable 
state. This state has the special property of having a large 
stimulated emission probability because of  relatively long life 
 275 
time compared with usually short life times of other excited states. 
As a result of its ability to retain electrons, state E 2 soon contains 
more atoms than ground state E 1 . 
Now suppose that light, whose  photons have energy h 12 
equal E 2   E 1   is incident on the substance. These photons can 
be absorbed and excite the 
few electrons in level E 1 
and to E 2 .     
Also they can cause elec-
trons to fall from E2  to E 1  
giving rise to stimulated 
emission of light waves that 
are identical to the incident light wave. Because of population 
inversion, the rate of  energy  radiation  by                             
Fig.21.7 
stimulated emission exceeds  
the rate of absorption and the result is an amplification of the 
ordinary light. 
 
 
§21.8.  Atomic  mass 
 
From the Avogadro’ s law we have that the mass of a nucleus 
is of the order of 1024kg. Since, it is very small number, we will 
express it in terms of unified mass scale.  Thus one atomic mass 
unit (amu) is equal to 1 / 12 of the mass of the carbon atom.  
1 amu = 1. 660 x 10 27 kg.

CHAPTER  22 
 
The Atomic Nucleus 
 
 
§22.1.  A  structure of   nucleus 
 
 The central region of the atom is called nucleus with a nuclear 
diameter of the order of 10  14 m surrounded by a cloud of 
electrons giving an atomic radius of order of 10  10 m. 
The nucleus  contain  the  protons and neutrons generally 
called the nucleons.  
 The  mass of proton on unified atomic mass scale is 1.007296 
and that of neutron is 1.008665. The electron mass has only 
0.000548 amu . The properties of particles in the atom are 
summarized in table. 
Total number of nucleons is known as the mass number. This 
quantity can be used in order to calculation of radius of nucleus by 
empirical formula   
  
r = 1.4 x 10 15 A 1 / 3  m. 
 
where  A  is the mass number. 
The number of protons Z is the atomic number. The number of 
neutrons N is equal  to  A    Z. 
The charge of the nucleus is equal to the number of the element 
in the Mendeleyev s periodic  system . The number of electrons in 
a neutral atom is equal to the charge of the nucleus. 
 277 
Isotopes are the nuclei with the same Z , but various number of 
neutrons. The isotope of chemical element with the Z and A is 
accepted  to denote as Z
A
 X .  
Nuclei of different elements with the same mass number A are 
called isobars. The isobars have different Z and different N, but 
the mass number  A = Z + N is the same. 
 
 
 
§22.2.  Mass defect.  Nuclear binding energy 
 
 The mass of nucleus always less than the masses of the 
constituent nucleons, together in the free state. The difference 
 between the sum masses in rest of nucleons and the mass of 
nucleus is known as  the  mass defect: 
 
   M = Zm A Z  m Mp n                         ( 22.1 ) 
 
where  m p , m n and M are the masses of proton, neutron and 
nucleus respectively. 
    Knowing the mass defect the binding energy can be 
determined.    
It  is  equal to the work  need in order to escape the nucleon 
outer  the nucleus. The binding energy of nucleus  is calculated as  
 
 E =  M c  =  2   Z m A m M  c  p n 2  Z       ( 22.2 ) 
 
According ( 22.2 )   for the binding energy per nucleon we get  
 
E =


                                   ( 22.3 ) 
 
where  A  is the mass number. 
 278 
A dependence of the binding energy per nucleon upon mass 
number for stable nuclei is shown in Fig. 22.1  The curve rises 
initially with increasing the A and reaches the saturated value for 
A  15. When A  60 the curve slowly decreases, because of more 
heavy nuclei are less stable as compared to that elements occupied 
the middle of the periodic system. To support the stability of 
nuclei a great 
number of neu-
trons is required, 
because they 
have only the 
nuclear attrac-
tion. Under most 
greater Z the ex-
cess neutrons can 
not compensate 
the increasing 
Coulomb repulsion           Fig.22.1 
and therefore there  
are no stable nuclei with Z 82. 
A value of energy, corresponding to the mass defect, equal 
1a.m.u is 931.5 MeV. Thus,

§22.3.  Radioactive processes 
 
The elements with Z  82 are unstable and that the natural 
radioactivity is caused by the disintegration (decay) or break up of 
the unstable nuclei. These nuclei may emit an  (alpha)  
radiation,  (beta)  radiation and accompanied by a  (gamma)  
ray.  The elements which emit these three types of radiation are 
called radioactive elements. 
 279 
1.  decay.  particles  are emitted  from radioactive nuclei. 
Atomic number Z of  the parent  nucleus  drops by 2 unit and 
mass number  A drops by 4 unit. (Fig 22.2) The  nucleus equation 
has the form

2.   decay.  The process of  ( beta ) emission involves no 
change in mass number A. It does however change the atomic 
number Z by  1 or +1 depending on whether the particle emitted is

mass number A remains unchangeable ( Fig. 22.4 ). This reaction 
is written in the form

3.   radiation. In this process the short  length 
electromagnetic wave is radiated. An excited nucleus X  goes 
back to its ground (unexcited) state, by emitting one or more of 
gamma ray. Since,   rays are mass less photon, their emission 
will cause no change either of A or of Z of the parent nuclei. 
The equation for the transmutation of a nucleus by the emission 
of a gamma ray is

Thus,   decay does not change a transmutation of one 
element into another.  
4. K - occupation. A nucleus occupies one electron of K -                    
shell. In result  one of protons of nucleus transmitted into 
neutrino. Atomic number of new nucleus decreases by one  unit 
 282

transmutation has the following form:

5. Spontaneous   fission of nuclei. In this process two or three 
neutrons are radiated. Nucleus of uranium and plutonium  split 
into two  parts with various masses. The masses  produced 
become the same with increasing of  mass number A. An equation

daughter drops by one unit in a new nucleus. The corresponding 
equation is written as

§22. 4.  Law of radioactive decay.  
Half life. Activity 
 
It has been observed that,  the actual number of atoms which 
decay at any instant is proportional to the number of atoms 
present. 
A  variation  of the  number of radioactive nuclei  is calculated 
in accordance with the following law: Suppose, number of decays 
dN over time period t is proportional the number of  present 
parent nuclei N:  
dN=  Ndt 
 
 283 
where coefficient of proportionality   is called the decay 
constant. N  is the number of radioactive nuclei present at time t. 
 The given expression  may be re written as 
 
dN
N
dt   
 whose solution  gives: 
 
N= N 0  e 
  t                            ( 22.12 ) 
 
where N0   is the original number of  radioactive  nuclei  at  t =0. 
An equation ( 22.12 ) is known as the law of radioactive decay. 
Half  life.  The number of radioactive atoms in a material that 
decay to one half of the original number in a time is characteristic 
of a material. Thus, the time taken for the atoms or a radioactive 
material to decay to half of original number is called the half life 
of the material. The half  life  of a radioactive material is a nuclear 
property and is not influenced in any way by the physical 
conditions of the material (temperature, pressure or chemical  
reactions ).  
The variation in the number of atoms decaying a particular  
time can be graphically represented as shown in Fig. 22.5.  The 
half life is represented by  T1/2   and is determined from the graph 
as the time taken for the radioactivity to fall to half of the original 
value N0 . Substituting t = T1/2   and N= 
1

N0  from eq. (22.12 ) 
we get 
T1/2 =

Radioactive elements Technetium ( Z=43, T1/2 = 2.6 million 
years ) and Promethium ( Z=6.1, T1/2 = 265 days )  have rather 
short lifetimes compared to the age of our planet  ( 4.5 billion 
years ). 
 284 
Activity.  The activity of radioactive sample is the number of 
disintegrations per second that occur.

write also  
A  = A O e

The SI unit for activity is the becquerel ( Bq ) :  one becquerel  
equals one disintegration per second.  Activity is also measured in 
terms of   unit called curie ( Ci ) :   
 1 Ci = 3.70 x 10 10 Bq .

§22. 5.  Nuclear fission  and  fusion 
   
 The fission process was discovered in the irradiation of 
uranium with neutrons by the chemists Hahn and Strassman in 
1938. Fission is the splitting of a nucleus into two or more 
fragments of almost equal size.   The nuclei of U 235 were split by 
incident neutrons into two massive parts of nearly equal masses, 
almost as if it were a drop of liquid breaking up:

    It is occur because the energy liberated in such nuclear 
reactions was many order greater than in ordinary nuclear 
reactions.  The binding energy of nuclei decreases with the 
increase of mass number A.  On the other hand, the long range 
repulsive forces in the heavy elements become almost comparable 
to the nuclear forces. The addition of one more particle in the 
nucleus easily disturbs the equilibrium and the nucleus becomes 
unstable. Nuclear fission can be best explained if we imagine an  
atomic nucleus to be an electrically charged droplet ( Fig. 22.6. )  
An addition  of another particle would transform its initial 
spherical shape into a more or less dumbell shape causes two 
kinds of forces to act on it:  
1.  The forces of nuclear surface tension attempting to restore 
the nucleus to its original spherical shape. 
2.  Coulomb repulsive forces between the electric charges on 
the opposite ends of the dumbell attempting to break up the 
nucleus into two halves. 
Nuclear fusion.  A process inverse to the fission is called 
nuclear fusion. The heavier nuclei are formed from two or more 
lighter nuclei. The energy released in the fusion of lighter nuclei 
into heavier nuclei is called thermonuclear fusion.

Note, that in all processes of nuclear changes or nuclear 
disintegrations the following physical quantities should remain 
constant: electric charge, energy, mass, linear and angular 
momentums, nucleon number. 
 
 
§22.6. Nuclear reactor 
 
 The principle of nuclear reactor is the controlled fission chain 
reaction. These nuclear reactors are being  widely used in many 
countries of the world for the commercial generation of 
electricity. Today there are many kinds and sizes of reactors, but 
they all have three basic components ; fuel element, a neutron 
moderator, and control rods . 
In order that a chain reaction is self sustained it is important to 
slow down the fast neutrons which appears as fission fragments. 
This is achieved by placing uranium, the fuel element in the shape 
of thin rods of about  1 cm in diameter in a medium known as 
moderator. The medium is made up of nuclei of comparable mass 
 287 
to that of mass of the neutron and of material which does not 
absorb the precious neutrons and thus takes them out of the fission 
producing cycle. Graphite is usually used as moderator in nuclear 
reactors. The fast neutron produced in a fission process thus 
undergo several successive collisions and are slowed down. In 
case too many neutrons are produced, the chain reaction becomes 
very fast and thus must be prevented getting out of hand. This is 
done by inserting in the reactor control rods of boron or cadmium, 
which are effective neutron absorbers. These rods can be moved 
in and out of the reactor from the control room. If the fission chain 
starts to go too fast, the control rods can be slightly withdrawn. In 
the case of electrical failure the control rods fall and shut off the 
reactor automatically. In a large power reactor there may be 
thousand of fuel element placed closed together, the entire 
reaction of fuel elements being known as the reactor core. 
A charge machine is used to start the reactor. The uranium 
rods, each of about 1 m long and 2 cm in diameter are lowered 
into about 1700 fuel channels in the graphite core. The boron steel 
rods are then raised slowly and placed at certain position as soon  
as the chin reaction proceed at the required rate. The reactor is 
now said to have “ gone critical “ and heat is produced steadily. 
The hot gas is led into heat exchanger outside the reactor. It 
heats up water and gets converted into high pressure and low 
pressure steam. The steam is used to drive the turbines which tum 
electrical  generators 
 
 
§22.7.  Particle observation and detecting methods 
 
1. Method of scintillations 
 If the glass plate covered with the thin film of zink sulphide 
ZnS is placed in the dark and the substance radiating alpha 
particles or protons bring up nearly to it then by means of 
microscope separate fluorescences are observed. Each of these 
fluorescences is due to  single  particle. Sometime are seen the 
 288 
sections of trajectories, over which these particles move. By 
recording the number of fluorescences and trajectories one can 
count the number of particles falling  on the layer of illuminating 
substance. 
2.  Fluorescence counters 
This method presents the technique of scintillations. However 
the process of particle recording is executed by  no eye, but with 
the help of photocell. Photons emitted upon the illuminations  fall 
on the photocathode of photocell and create the electric current in 
a circuit of it. By recording the number of current pulses one can 
detect not only the observed fluorescences produced by  alpha 
particles, but  weak fluorescences caused by electrons falling on 
the illuminating substance as well. 
3. Wilson cloud chamber  
 The particle detecting by cloud chamber is based on the 
principle that supersaturated vapors condense more readily on 
ions or dust particles. It is in a way similar to formation of clouds 
in the atmosphere. Warm air containing evaporated water 
molecules expands and cools as it rises in the atmosphere. Below 
a certain temperature the water molecules form tiny droplets. 
These drops then condense on dust particles around and form a 
cloud which is visible. Wilson showed that if the air inside a 
chamber was dust free but contained ions, then the excess water 
vapors in the air would condense around these ions reflect light 
and can be photographed. In this way a visible track of the path of 
ionizing particle can be obtained. 
 The cloud chamber was suggested to be placed in the magnetic 
field. It permits to determine the charge, speed and mass of flying 
particles. 
4. Geiger - Muller counter 
An ionizing particle if enters a Geiger - Muller tube, creates 
ions and free electrons in the gas through successive collisions 
with the atoms of the gas. 
The electrons are pulled so strongly towards the central  
 289 
positive  wire ( Fig. 22.8.) that they further strike gas atoms, 
knocking off other electrons. Thus an avalanche of electrons is 
formed, which when reaches the positive wire, creates a detectible 
current pulse through the counting unit such as scaler. For each 
particle passing through the tube  a pulse is recorded. In this way 
Geiger counter is able to count the particles that come through it. 
The gas must be made nonconducting immediately in order to 
register the entry of the next particle. This is called quenching of 
discharge. The conduction is terminated by an external unit which 
momentarily drops the voltage on the anode below the critical 
value for ionization. The tube thus becomes ready to register the 
next incoming particle. Likewise a momentary current or pulse is 
recorded corresponding to each single particle entering the tube. 
However, the size of the current pulse is independent of both the 
energy and type of incident radiations. 
5. Bubble chamber   
This method is based to the observation of gas bubbles formed 
in result of vaporization of superheated liquid including the ions. 
In a liquid these ions can be produced due to particles with 
energy, less than the energy of ions of super-cooled vapor. 
Therefore, the chamber with superheated vapor permits to observe 
the trajectories of accelerated charged particles having lower 
energies as compared to that the particles detected by means of 
cloud chamber. 
 
 
§22.8.  Measurement of radiation intensity 
 
1.  Radiation absorbed dose.   Absorbed dose is known as a 
ratio of absorbed energy to the mass of irradiated substance: 
 
D =
W
m
W
V

 
 ,                            ( 22.14 ) 
 
 290 
where W the energy absorbed, V the volume of substance and  is 
its density. 
The SI unit of absorbed dose is Grey ( Gr ) = 
Joule
kg
 
2. Expose dose.  Exposition dose is equal to the ratio of charge 
produced as a result of ionization due to irradiation to the mass of 
ionized air. 
D E = 
Q
m
                                  ( 22.15 ) 
The SI unit of expose  dose is  roentgen. 
1 R = 2.58x10 4 C /kg 
 
3. Dose Rate.   Dose power is defined as a dose per unit time.  
P D = 
D
t
                                  ( 22.16 ) 
4. Equivalent dose. The radiation equivalent is the biological 
dose and equals to the  absorbed dose multiplied the translational  
coefficient.     
  The equivalent dose is measured in  sieverts ( sv )   or 1 ber = 
10 2 sv.
